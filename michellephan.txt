0:00hey guys welcome back to mastering the art of today we're going to talk about
0:04you guessed it
0:05cushion compact everything you need to know about which is the best cushion to
0:09look for the best color for your skin type and the best techniques have fun
0:12and of course good luck don't worry if you're new to cushion compacts
0:17here's a quick one on one they originated from Korea and normally they
0:20provide a lightweight sheer coverage the packaging as you can see here is bulkier
0:24than your average compact because it has to create an airtight seal to keep your
0:29cushion fresh
0:30if you look inside you'll find an applicator which is usually a dense
0:33antibacterial circular sponge like this in a porous sponge that soaks in
0:38foundation BB or CC cream
0:40here's my favorite pro tip just like how you're flipping the matches to turn the
0:44bed
0:44flip the sponge when the product starts to run low it's kind of like go on up
0:48for the sponge
0:49the application is pretty universal all you have to do is load the applicator
0:53sponge and start blogging onto the skin in small even paths
0:57choosing the right cushion compact all comes down to selecting the right finish
1:00and coverage for your skin tone and type if you have fair skin then you know the
1:05struggle of finding product that matches your complexion
1:08when I say fair I mean skin that is paler than a ghost
1:12so pale that your face is naturally blown out in flash photos but it's all
1:16good because those of you with fair skin have a decent range of brands to choose
1:19from many of my favorites are from South Korea
1:24if you have a light to medium 10 skin town you have a lot of options to play
1:28with a lot of the Korean brands will carry only a few shades that generally
1:33fall in the light to medium skin tones
1:35here are some of my favorite brands to check out
1:38because cushion compact is relatively new and face makeup
1:42unfortunately shade range is limited but there are brands who carry shades for
1:48deeper tones cushions are also available in color correction shade yellow helps
1:53with discoloration purple combats dullness peach brightens dark circles
1:57and green neutralizes redness
2:00now we can move on to recommendations for different skin types when selecting
2:04the cushion compact for dry skin instead of finding one that is foundation based
2:08look for one that is BB or CC cream based for application use a good
2:12moisturizer and hydrating primer
2:14you can even spray a moisturizing toner on your application sponge before
2:18applying in order to keep your skin hydrated and the foundation from
2:22settling into fine lines from here
2:24just continue building your desired coverage by adding thin layers i
2:28recommend pressing and lifting like this to avoid streaks and dry patches here
2:32are some of my pics for dry skin
2:35when it comes to selecting the cushion compact for combination skin you have a
2:40wider range to choose from since you can tolerate compacts for dry and oily skin
2:44for application
2:45start by applying your cushion compact around your jawline and cheeks building
2:49coverage as you go from there
2:51damn around the t-zone area with the Beauty Blender in order to avoid build
2:55up and once you're done immediately set this area with powder for a flawless
2:59finish
3:00here are some bread that you can try out for combination skin
3:04if you have oily skin be aware that cushion compact are not the best choice
3:08because of their duty finishes
3:10no worries though there are cushion compact for you just try and find one
3:14that has a mattifying or satin finish
3:16stay away from the ones with hydrating benefits and look for one that has a
3:19lightweight formula when it comes to application
3:22start by using your favorite mattifying prime something like milk of magnesia
3:26that will soak up the oil on your t-zone and keep him at throughout the day after
3:30building your desired coverage finish off with a mattifying spray and apply
3:34translucent or mattifying powder to keep your skin looking fresh
3:38here are my recommendations for oily skin both acne in mature skin are
3:44grouped together here because both types require extra attention
3:47the trick is to keep your skin balance you want to look for cushion compacts
3:51with added skincare benefits and stay away from heavy formulas with harsher
3:55ingredients for application start with the primer to help smooth out fine lines
4:00or blemishes
4:01from here you can apply with a damp sponge to avoid excess product in fine
4:05lines be sure that you're applying in thin layers because most of the formulas
4:09are sheer you may have to touch up with a spot concealer unblemished areas
4:15yeah
4:15once you're done with the application finish off the hydrating setting missed
4:19and here are some brand recommendations

1:35so start around the eyes and move out to the rest of the face to even it out
1:39ok
1:42and don't forget to powder up to keep your makeup lasting all into the night

1:00lower lash line to create an edgy look avoid wearing bold eye shadow colors
1:05kpopstarz usually prefer to sport eyeliner however if you need to add more
1:10glamour
1:10glitter is your best friend if you want more drama to your eyes at fake lashes
1:15and now you're kpop is done and now that your eyes are dying
1:19it's time to show your face in love you want to start off by using BB cream

1:26combination of tinted moisturizer
1:28Sarah and primer k-pop stars are all about perfecting the skin so it's
1:33important to create a flawless face here i'm going to use Coastal Scents
1:37concealer palette

2:20I really love this brow look because it really reminds me about your helper you
2:24want to create folder looking brows with minimal arch the straighter the better
2:29also you don't want your brow link to be too long
2:32keep it short the full your brows and more youthful you look almost done guys
2:36time for the lips here i have three different marinus lip balm glossy
2:40lacquer stains to choose from a red rose pink and white piece
2:44these are actually colors that k-pop stars would rock I decided to choose the
2:48rose pink color
2:50remember to avoid any dark lips takes like plums deep browns and dark berries
2:54also stick with the lip finish that doesn't have any glitter or pearl
2:59texture
3:00you're finished should either have a matte glossy or satin finish
3:04when it comes to kpop fashion it's all about the accessories
3:08I decided for a glitzy look for this one and of course you can wear black
3:12but I would look for tops with interesting cutouts remember try and
3:15keep it family friendly
3:16no low-cut tops you don't want to show an evil twins if you want rocker crazy
3:21jacket look for something metallic shiny the edge here the better when it comes

4:17the theme of their songs
4:22and now it's time for the guys let's turn them into kpop stars
4:27this look is actually inspired by the boy band TVXQ i would recommend going
4:31two to three shades lighter and just skip the bronzer and contouring it's not
4:35need to tear for the brows same thing straight in a little angled if his brows
4:40are super dark and jet-black try and lighten them just a bit for the eyes

4:49liner on the lower lash line when it comes to his hair keep it straight Matt

5:03public is done to really complete this look
5:06try and learn the TVXQ catch me help you
5:38you wanna know
5:55yeah
6:02have fun and good luck
6:05and don't forget to check out if see com
0:00seductive look is inspired by the lax brought to life by the flamenco dancers
0:10of Spain fierce in passionate like a row center thorns
0:15this is the spanish
0:22we all know that every great masterpiece begins with a flawless canvas
0:26let's begin by applying a lightweight CC cream which will smooth and hydrate your
0:31skin if you're looking for a sheer natural coverage cc or BB cream is the
0:37way to go
0:38just blend everything away with your clean fingers and let's move on
0:43see this concealer i made this so that you can cover up anything
0:48hence the name because BB and CC creams are so sure it might not be able to
0:53cover up dark circles or smaller skin blemishes
0:56so that's why spot treating these little imperfections with your concealer is so
1:00crucial
1:01you can either use your clean fingers or a brush to blend the concealer
1:06notice how I'm making this dabbing motion instead of dragging the brush to
1:10blend dab instead you'll notice the concealer blames faster and it's more
1:15gentle on the skin
1:19unless your foundation and concealer has a powder finish set everything with a
1:24translucent loose powder the powder will keep the makeup lasting longer anything
1:30within a Molly and texture will move increase into your fine lines and that's
1:34why powder will prevent this from happening
1:37and before moving on to the eyes just apply a little bit of attempted red lip
1:43balm which will help moisturize your lips so they're primed and ready for
1:46lipstick
1:47cool time for the fun part the eyes start with the metallic purple color on
1:53the center of the lid if you look closely the shade has many dimensions to
1:58it which will complement the other purple and gold colors that we're going
2:02to be applying later
2:05we call this dual chrome next use a shadow brush and apply a light wash of
2:11this pale lavender shade across the lids blending as you go
2:15do you see the dabbing motion again you have more control if you doubt the
2:18eyeshadow on instead of brushing it on pick up this / lavender color and accent
2:25the inner corner of the eyes
2:26this will give your eyes at hint of pastel color it's time to shadow in the
2:31bottom lashline pick up this metallic berry shade and bring the color up along
2:36the lower lash line and into the eye socket to create definition and
2:40dimension
2:41if you want a romantic smokey look build up the color intensity don't just tackle
2:47it on
2:47it's all about layering and creating a very slow buildup
2:51you'll have more control this way and just blend the contour shade so that it
2:55doesn't have a hard edge
3:05to really make your eyes appear fiery and alive
3:09take a sparkling blue shadow and gold and line the bottom lash line from the
3:13inner corner to the middle of the eye
3:15doing this will give your eyes that multifaceted look so every time you move
3:19the shadow will change with the light
3:24lastly use the light purple shadow on the brow bone which will blend away any
3:28harsh lines and create that hazy school on to effect because this look is bold
3:36and adventurous your liner should mirror that so don't be shy
3:40before beginning make sure your liner is sharpened for more precision when lining
3:46you also want to make sure that your black liner has a more creamy texture
3:50not the hard pencil one because we are going to lunge this baby up
3:55start at the outer corner of your eyes and work your way in and don't forget to
4:02line the water line to help intensify the look with the smudger brush or if
4:06you have the water liner pencil flip it over and use the smudger tool smudge the
4:10eyeliner would do so gently
4:12don't drag it on your eyes try and use a gentle patting motion keep doing it
4:17until you get this smoky effect
4:20no black eyeshadow needed just a creamy black eyeliner
4:24cool all right onto the brows I like to use to brow pencils to create my natural
4:29brow look
4:30and the reason being is because your brow hairs are made up of so many
4:33different colors and I like to keep the lighter color along the head of my brows
4:38and a darker color along the tale of my brows so fill in your brows and cover up
4:43any sparse areas
4:47honestly the brows are the most important step to any of their makeup
4:52routine so don't skip this step
4:54unless you have perfectly shaped browse lucky you
5:02now grab your mascara and go to town the more coats the better
5:06and if you need to add fake lashes we want sky-high lashes so that every time

6:20I like to contour the sides of my nose to elevate it
6:23if you want to contour properly you have to find the right color and texture

8:33updated daily at Michelle Phan com
0:00what's that majestic human
0:07I always believed how a new year is kind of like a blank canvas
0:13and I like to celebrate this idea by enhancing my favorite features the clean
0:17and fresh beauty look anyone of all ages can wear this look
0:22let's begin with a clean canvas before I attack my face of makeup
0:28I always like to start with a clean face to remove makeup residue use a makeup
0:34wipe to reveal is squeaky clean surface if you prefer using a non oil based
0:39makeup remover chlorine makes one that's enriched with corn flower extract i know
0:44not everyone has five minutes to spare
0:47but if you do show your face in love by nurturing it
0:50the deep hydrating mask stress can tire the body and it reflects on the face
0:56so finding any bit of relaxation helps and substituting a traditional
1:02moisturizer for dewy skin missed instead my favorite one by tata acts like a
1:07primer and illuminator it helps reduce any dry patches on my skin
1:11try not to neglect your lips especially if you're wearing a lot of liquid
1:16lipsticks many can be drawing so be sure to exfoliate your lips from time to time
1:21mmm this sugar lips crab tastes pretty good
1:25ok finally we can begin with makeup I like to use concealer first and spot
1:29treat any blemishes quality concealers are hard to come by when you do a little
1:34goes a long way
1:36spot treat and gently Pat like this to blend from there
1:40I like to even out the area around my nose and mouth because of excess redness
1:44moving onto the ice
1:47load up your brush with a light camel color and begin making a subtle pseudo
1:52cut crease
1:53try not to create a harsh line like a traditional countries make it feathery
1:59take a mat charcoal color loaded up with a tiny angled brush get close to your
2:05eyes
2:06notice how this gives an illusion of a thicker lash line when doing this
2:11just be sure to use a light hand with the same brush begin to feather out the
2:16darker color along your lash line sweep it out into a wing
2:20this will help elongate the shape of your eyes so from here
2:23just grab more color and begin to intensify the wing taking your time in
2:27starting lightly allows you to build up the intensity in layers now using a
2:32small eyeshadow brush loaded up with a warm earth tone shadow and begin to line
2:37the lower lash line like this
2:39I know this beauty style looks pretty simple but you'd be surprised the most
2:45simple and natural looks actually require the most time because of the
2:48blending layering and feathering and once you're done just blend it out with
2:52a fluffy brush
2:55yes there is such a thing as a sailor moon liquid eyeliner and I have to say
3:01it's one of my favorite liners
3:03i'm going to use this one over the previous eyeliner to sharpen line begin
3:08tapering out the line
3:09little by little to create a tapered . this will provide the most line control
3:14giving you the perfect wing
3:16ok let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the wraps
3:20first I'm going to use a powder to create the base for my brow shape if you
3:26wanted to look natural
3:27the powder finish should be mat from here
3:30I like to layer a pencil over creating hairlike strokes make feathery marks
3:35like so and blur the lines by combing is glee through your brows using your
3:40favorite lash curler my holy grail issues
3:43press firmly against the roots of your lashes and trying to pinch yourself
3:48keep pressing from root to tip to get the best holding curl
3:52all right now you can tight line your eyes using a warm brown eyeliner the
4:00definition it gives goes well with the color you already placed on your lower
4:04lash line
4:05now you can fuck up your lashes with generous coats of mascara
4:09I know for some people the idea of sweeping mascara through the lashes
4:13seems terrifying but honestly for me every time I swipe
4:18it's such a satisfying feeling i know im so weird
4:22so I found the best full lashes for Asian eyes they're called diamond lash
4:26and i discovered them in Tokyo
4:27first off the reason why they're so amazing is because they're super easy to
4:31peel off and I don't have to cut down the link
4:33the band is super thin and it fits perfectly for Asian eyelids
4:38BAM look how natural this looks okay once your lashes are set
4:42give them one more curl to get them all perky and excited and now you got some
4:46body lashes
4:47I like to powder when i'm almost done with the makeup because it helps
4:51maintain the freshman's look at how pretty this gradient blushes
4:59it's not your basic blush color but it's wearable watch use a brush or contour
5:04brush and sweep it back and forth to load it up with the color pop this on to
5:07your cheeks I softly blending out towards your temple
5:10all right you should be a magical now but if you're craving more dimension
5:14lightly contour use a matte neutral bronzer in the hollows of your cheeks
5:18and dust the rest around your upper hairline to balance out the face
5:22I was done finish off the look with the sultry path
5:28profit with lip liner if needed and top it off with a gradation liquid lipstick
5:36all right now you're done enjoy your body self love you
5:42good luck
5:55yeah
0:00hi need help on doing makeup for pictures
0:03no worries because i'm here to help
0:06before anything
0:10apply lip balm on your lips to get them nice and moisturized
0:18let's move on to sense came to avoid that white cast look you know when your
0:23face is white and the rest of your body is normal tone you want to use a
0:27chemical sunscreen instead of a physical sunscreen basically avoid using a
0:31sunscreen with titanium dioxide and or zinc oxide select a photo friendly
0:36foundation basically a foundation with low SPF anything below spf20 should be
0:42fine because again it won't leave your face with that white cast as you guys
0:47can see I have a little bit of redness going on my skin
0:50so I'm going to use this mint green cover stick from Maybelline what it's
0:54going to do is that it's going to neutralize the redness on my skin
0:57I know it's a little weird kind of like I'm turning myself into the Wicked Witch
1:00of the West but as you guys know green and red are complementary colors they
1:05neutralize each other out so that when you apply foundation concealer on top of
1:09the mint green color
1:10you won't see any redness
1:13yeah
1:21and as you guys can see my skin looks even to combat zombie eyes just add a
1:27little bit of concealer around your eye area with your ring finger
1:31maybe we shall try and sleep a little more if we don't want RBIs for the face
1:34i'm going to use a matte powder to set my makeup i'm going to start around my
1:38under eye area and then move towards the rest of my face
1:44kylie i know it's safe
1:48no we don't
1:49with using a white or nude matte eyeshadow loaded on your finger and make
1:54a stroke on the bridge of your nose then blend away sometimes
1:58shimmer can make your face look like it's a little oily we want to try and
2:01keep your entire makeup as mad as possible
2:04all right now it's time for eyeshadows I'm going to stick with the good old
2:07foolproof neutral eyeshadow palette you first want to use the new color as your
2:11base color apply it on your legs with a brush to clean finger
2:21next step use a matte taupe color as a contour shade and then blend away
2:27taupe is a wonderful color to use if you want to come to your eyes without making
2:31it look too happy
2:33never
2:37be
2:41now take a white eyeshadow or pencil and highlight the inner corners of your eyes
2:46this will open up your eyes more you know photograph beautifully
2:51yeah
2:53yeah
2:54take a black eye shadow and line your eyes keep the line as soft as possible
3:00who
3:08and if you want add lower lashes to create an illusion of bigger eyes
3:17so now we can layer a liquid liner on top of the soft I later that you just
3:21made
3:22keep the line as thin as possible
3:26what
3:29yeah
3:30with the eyeliner done you can now curl your lashes and get them nice and perky
3:34for mascara
3:36add as many coats of mascara as you need
3:40personally I need extra help so I'm going to use fake lashes to add more
3:44drama to my eyes find fake lashes that go with your eye shape
3:48thumbs up if you guys would like me to do a video on finding the right fake
3:51lashes for your eyes
3:52the thing about love isn't love side
3:55come
3:56we're almost done with the eyes all you have to do is just fill in your brows
4:00I decided for this look I wanted my brows to look fuller
4:03I find that when I have fuller browse I tend to look more youthful and sweet is
4:09this true human
4:12you want
4:13and don't forget to use brow gel this will keep the stray hairs in place
4:19yeah
4:19just let alone
4:21yeah
4:23I kind of like to do a little picture test around this time just to see how
4:27I'm doing and I decided to Instagram is too
4:29I noticed from the photo that my nose lacked a little bit of definition so i
4:34decided to contour it by shading the sides of my nose with a matte bronzer or
4:38taupe eyeshadow
4:43perfect and now it's time for blush and bronzer
4:49contour cheeks and add extra color to them because in flash photography
4:53it can sometimes remove twenty percent of color and intensity from your makeup
4:58usually when i'm doing makeup for flash photography I like to use a heavier hand
5:02for the lips
5:03I decided to line my lips for fuller looking smile yes we're almost done just
5:08finish off with the lip color of your choice
5:10I decided to mix up my own color a nude pink shade
5:15well
5:18and now that my face is done i'm going to finish off this look with the hair
5:22braid one side of your hair like this
5:25any braids will do for me is a little lazy i'm just going to stick with the
5:29traditional raid
5:31yeah
5:38and when you're done reading just tuck it in the back and take a bobby pin and
5:42pin it in place
5:46that's it I know it's super easy right
5:52here are some extra tips if your eyes get red before the photoshoot use eye
5:57drops
5:57this will make your eyes appear brighter refreshing oil blotting sheets are a
6:03must before you take that photo blog any excess oil instead of powdering your
6:08face
6:08you don't want to over mattify your face or else your face will lack definition
6:12for me I like to stay away from dangling earrings because it can shorten the
6:17length of my neck
6:18small earrings like these are cute and will always be in fashion
6:22mmm what to wear since most likely you'll be photographed from the waist up
6:27Lucas more around this area maybe you can try and find a pretty neckline or
6:31play around fun colors
6:39and if you're wearing glasses make sure they're non-reflective
6:46and there's nothing wrong with keeping it casual
6:55intricate necklines are great if you want to bold luck and if you want more
6:59focus on your lower neck area where a scoop neckline with fun patterns
7:03this will open up your neckline or maybe you can start for that
7:06scarves are so fun to wear perhaps you're feeling a little edgy
7:11don't be afraid of spikes hopefully you won't get in trouble for wearing this
7:14because it could actually hurt someone
7:16and I'll also be doing a DIY video and how to spike up your jacket
7:20the next video will be about posing for the camera and finding your best angle

0:00yeah
0:06mmm
0:14gorges here's a beautiful edgy look for you to experiment with this fall
0:21highlighted cheeks straight brows framing tapered smokey eyes paired with
0:26the peach nude or fibrin glue it
0:28oh and shout out to my designer friend at human aliens for making the sick body
0:33suit
0:33he combines my two favorite things fashion and Anna me
0:37ok let's get started before you beat your face with makeup
0:42you want to make sure you have a clean smooth canvas to work on this is why
0:46exfoliating is essential
0:48you can either use a gentle scrub to polish off the skin or my favorite way a
0:53gentle exfoliating peel like this one by skin inc
0:56so i've been using this product for over a year and I loved it so much I had to
0:59get it seemed to sample it in the glam bag
1:02all you have to do is apply this product on your face and you'll notice right
1:05away your dead skin peeling off the kind of look like a racer crumbs weird and
1:10kind of gross but it pays off from here just rinse your face and now touch your
1:15skin
1:16it should feel baby butt smooth this is my favorite hydrating skin missed
1:20no joke I wasn't paid to see any of this this dewy skin mist has saved my skin
1:25because it's so dry in LA after a few good sprays my skin instantly looks and
1:31feel supple
1:33for this look I decided to go for straight brows with no arch so that
1:39means i'm going to cover up the corners of my brows
1:42i'm just going to use concealer but i recommend using either non-toxic glue
1:45stick or spirit gum with wax for a more realistic look
1:50however for the sake of this tutorial and me not wanting to remove the glue
1:54from my brows
1:55I'm just going to opt for concealer you guys get the picture for my brows
1:59i'm applying a soft mix of hazel and dark brown matte shade with an angled
2:04small brush draw a straight edge using the inner corners as a guide
2:08I'm tapering line upwards this will create an illusion of the lifted face
2:13for your eyes warm up some concealer between your fingers and use it as an
2:20eyeshadow base use loose final powder on a fluffy brush to set the concealer on
2:30your lids
2:32this will reduce any creasing using the same brush apply a dark brown color to
2:39the outer corner
2:40increase using a window wiper motion you can create a lot of depth and dimension
2:45with just one that color
2:47it's all about layering and how hard or light or application pressure is now
2:52with a metallic burgundy eyeshadow and using a small shadow brush pack this
2:56color onto your outer eyelid you want to concentrate the color as close to your
3:01lash line as possible to create more depth using a tightly packed blending
3:05brush blend out with the darkest color extending it to the crease and right
3:10underneath the eye from there
3:12find a warm tan color and blend this color under your eyes to balance them
3:16out with the same burgundy color accentuate the corner of the under eye
3:21and from there to sweep the shadow into a tight wing using the fine details
3:28angle brush
3:33get your wing just the way you want it
3:36and once you've sculpted out the shape you like clean the edges with a makeup
3:40brush for that precise edge
3:42ok let's take a break from the eyes onto the face
3:46take a rose gold cream shimmer and lightly Pat onto the apples of your
3:52cheeks for that base glow and from there
3:55using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream spot rate your face to reduce
4:00redness or blemishes
4:02so that your skin tone is even and natural-looking if you're more into that
4:06poreless flawless face find a foundation that has a high coverage if you're like
4:10me and you prefer a natural skin finish use a BB or CC cream that has a light to
4:15medium coverage
4:16apply a light hydrating lip gloss and let it soak into prep your lips with the
4:21same loose powder from before using a smaller face brush loaded up and feather
4:26over any shiny area
4:28okay now back to the eyes using your favorite eyeliner pencil or any liner
4:32that has a small brush sharpen the wing and line the eyes
4:36one trick that I like to use is to start at the inner edge of the line and apply
4:40in small strokes keeping the liner angles and pressing it up against the
4:45side this will easily give you the thinnest line imaginable for the outer
4:49corner wing it out by outlining first and then fill it in
4:56with a gold cream pigment apply a tiny amount using the small detailed brush on
5:02the inner corners and bottom lower lash line from there
5:06just blended together by using the same color to illuminate your upper lid
5:10i'm going to use this nifty product from Korea it's a dual ended stick to give
5:14yourself puffy eyes or a go sell in Korean literally means charming skin
5:19first step
5:20a few millimeters under your natural lower lash line draw a line with the top
5:24grin from there
5:26flip the pen over and use the shimmering white side carefully . between the line
5:30and just true
5:31it's kind of crazy what a little bit of taupe and shimmer can do as if you need
5:35to make your eyes any bigger
5:37but if you want to give her lashes a good curl and apply generous coats of
5:41mascara i chose one that has long bristles so that I could literally comb
5:46through my lashes to separate them
5:48if your brows are needing to be tamed use a brow gel to sculpt them in shape
5:52this tiny one here is by benefit and it's perfect for travel and it has
5:56fibers in it to give the appearance of actual brow hairs
6:00moving on using a light pearlescent cream shadow added to the inner part of
6:05your upper cheek bones for that highlight action
6:07this will make your cheeks appear fuller and we'll give you a more youthful
6:11appearance
6:12now it's time for the lips to prep them and prevent any lipstick from leading
6:17outline them with a lip liner similar to your lip color and with your favorite
6:24peachy nude lipstick apply this on your lips
6:27patting it on with your finger to get rid of any excess residue
6:31if a peach nude is too basic for you go crazy with the new bold lip color this
6:36liquid lipstick from jeffree star is super fun and hydrating formula stays
6:41put
6:41all day just make sure to carefully apply in little strokes and don't forget
6:45the sides of your mouth and in between your lips
6:48it doesn't matter what lip or makeup you decide to go with
6:52just make sure to wear it confidently because makeup is an expression of one
6:56of your many side
6:58express confidently and of course good luck

0:20there's a part of me that loves darkness I feel like I can hide in the shadows
0:25and disappear like a mystery
0:28I know it's cheesy but this is my alter ego you want to start off by pulling
0:33your hair back and using a cleansing wipe to get rid of any excess makeup
0:37dirt and oil on your face
0:39we want to start with a clean canvas as the temperature gets colder
0:46your skin's natural layer of moisture tends to dry out
0:49you can get rid of any flaky dry patches by using a microdermabrasion skin
0:54exfoliant warm it up in your hands and want the product onto your skin using a
0:59circular motion and once you're done just rinse it off your skin should look
1:03and feel polish after us Foley eight try to moisturize your skin or else it's
1:08gonna feel really dry and stiff you want to find a hydrating moisture mask to
1:13soothe your skin and now that your face is hydrated do the same on your lips
1:19coconut is a natural humectant which means it will help draw moisture in and
1:24keep your lips a little longer
1:26coconut is life all right moving on
1:30start taking those brows using a quality slanted tweezer try not to go overboard
1:35because you want your brows to stay full and natural-looking allow for some time
1:40before going out because there might be redness from the plucking
1:46using a cream highlighter apply this to the tops of your cheekbones you want to
1:50do this under your base to give your skin a natural do we look if you want to
1:54look younger

1:59cushion compact is by I obey this compact is called the six-second compact
2:04as they say one is sold every six seconds
2:08I wasn't paid to say that true fact the cushion applicator provides a light
2:12feathery coverage that will cling to any imperfections

2:19redness and blemishes or less noticeable
2:22all right now it's time to break out your favorite concealer so i've been
2:25using this cushion concealer and at first I didn't think i would like it but
2:29now I kind of use it for everything
2:32concealing and highlighting for this one you can use it under your eyes as well
2:36as other dark spots on your face such as blemishes and the areas around your nose
2:41and mouth
2:42so just blend out your concealer until it looks natural
2:47now it's time to set your face by stippling once and press powder
2:50I have right here this doll 10cc powder it's pretty unique because it has green
2:55and pink be even any imperfections and discolorations on the skin
3:00what's nice about it is that it doesn't have a Kiki finish before you buy any
3:04powder read reviews or test it out to make sure it's not chalky the powder
3:08should look and feel silky and refined
3:13find a dark cream eye color like a deep tongue or burgundy and warming up
3:18between your fingers when I only have five minutes to do a smokey eye
3:22this is my go-to method apply a dark cream eyeshadow or eyeliner directly on
3:27your eyelid lightly with your ring finger
3:30if you want more precision use your pinky finger keep dabbing to blend the
3:33shadow the murray blend the smokier and softer it look so now with your favorite
3:39pencil liner and using the back of a tweezer to hold the island in place
3:43create small strokes like this along your waterline
3:47personally I think this is the easiest way to apply eyeliner
3:50it's pretty much full proof and provides a nice smoky effect for more precision
3:55you can take a stiff angled brush to create that wing see you'll be a master
4:01at the smoky eye in no time
4:02tight lining is when you apply liner into the rim of your upper and lower
4:06lash line
4:07it feels kind of weird at first and your eyes might water but you kind of get
4:11used to it
4:12oh the things we do for beauty use a black felt-tip eyeliner to punctuate the
4:17shape and intensity of the wing
4:20perfect on my lazy days which I have a lot of i skip eyelash curling
4:27however it's useful for opening up your eyes unless you have naturally curly
4:31eyelashes and lucky
4:35when applying mascara to your upper lashes look down when applying it to the
4:40bottom
4:41look up or straight that way your body's natural reflex doesn't freak out when it
4:45sees this stick poking near your eye
4:48moving on to the brows using the taupe eyebrow pencil create feathery strokes
4:53to imitate little brow hairs using an angled eyeliner brush add fullness to
4:59the browse by flipping them out when your boo is complaining that you're
5:03taking way too long to do your makeup
5:05tell him next time browse over those when both eyes have the perfect lines
5:11use the wings as a guide to add more dimension to your crease with a small
5:15eyeshadow brush and using the same cream eyeliner intensify the depth of your
5:19eyes
5:20ok let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the cheeks find a dark brown
5:27hair that's three to four shades darker than your skin color to carve out your
5:31cheekbones with a fluffy angled brush to keep your contour as natural looking as
5:35possible use a light hand and try not to get too close to your mouth
5:40add bronzer along your temples to accentuate your face
5:43all right back to the eyes find a glittery eyeshadow in with your pinky
5:49because it's super tiny pop this shimmery eyeshadow along the inner third
5:53of your eyelid blending with your ring finger
5:56this will help bring more magic to your eyes
6:02by now my lips are nice and soft
6:05thanks to the coconut bomb and it's ready to be painted black
6:09before I apply any color make sure there's not a product left on the lips
6:13you want to remove any lingering concealer or foundation with a wipe
6:17giving yourself a clean canvas to work with ok now the moment of truth
6:23break out the darkest lip color you have start with the biggest areas on your
6:27lips around the center of the bottom and top lip
6:30it's kind of like painting within the lines so start with the largest areas
6:33first from there
6:35carefully apply the lipstick to the outline of your lips and it's totally
6:39fine if it's not perfect because we're going to clean it up later if you want
6:45more precision use a smaller brush to adjust the lines for a cleaner shape
6:52very nice
6:56all right moving on to hear if you're not using argan oil in your hair
7:00you're missing out all the nutrients lost during coloring treatments and heat
7:05styling can be restored if you use oils like argan oil the Royal Egyptians were
7:10young to have beautiful silky hair
7:12thanks to oil what you want to do is warm up the oil between your hands and
7:16finger comb through your hair for that silky finish
7:20and now it's time to transform into my alter ego
7:25there's a lot of beautiful temporary tattoos that you can find online or on
7:29etsy find your favorite design that speaks to you if you don't know exactly
7:34where an important part of the design is going to be placed
7:37what I like to do is cut a notch in the paper before I apply here I cut out a
7:43little notch in the middle of the neck application so I know exactly where to
7:47Center it and once you have it on and it's nice and centered had lightly with
7:51a water-soaked paper towel or sponge try to make sure that it thoroughly wet
7:56if you want to check to see if it transferred peel back one side slightly
8:00and if the tattoo is revealed
8:02you can safely peel the whole thing off from here
8:06just add more tattoos where you see fit
8:10tell your own story through these tattoos
8:14the art and design should inspire you don't worry they're only temporary
8:19so you can experiment as many times as you want with zero commitment
8:24now my alter ego look is complete if you're going to recreate your alter ego
8:28look
8:29make sure to tag me in all your pictures so that I can see now and like them
8:33mmm i love you dreamers good luck
8:40yeah
8:54yeah
8:59yeah
0:00yeah
0:00so i'm really loving taylor swift's me look and in this video i'm gonna show
0:05you how to recreate it
0:06majority of the products that i'm using in this video are from december's ipsy
0:10glam bag but if you don't have one no worries because i'm going to describe
0:14the colors as best as i can and you guys can use any products that you have that
0:17are similar at your disposal
0:19first thing first primary eyes primer is not only great to help saturate color
0:23but it also helps prevent smudging
0:26all right let's recreate Taylor's famous eyeliner look using Urban Decay's 24-7
0:31black liner
0:32I'm going to load it on my brush first the reason why I'm using a flat edge
0:36eyeliner brush is because sometimes the tip of the eyeliner pencil can be a
0:41little too blunt
0:42so what i'm doing here is i'm just flicking the brush ever so slightly to
0:46create an illusion of twinkling looking eyes like Taylor's notice how the cotton
0:51swab has a point your end
0:53cosmetic grey cotton swabs are seriously a must have for all you make up levers
0:58ok so finish line in your eyes and let's move on to making your eyes sparkle try
1:04and find a champagne loose eyeshadow color of your trace the 1 i'm using here
1:08is mixed ultra pearl mania eyeshadow pigments tend to have a stronger payout
1:13than regular eye shadows because the intensity is stronger uses as
1:18highlighter for your eyes to help brighten them up
1:20ok so depending on how much I laid space you have
1:24I prefer calling it eyelid real estate what i'm doing here is bringing my
1:28eyeliner up a few millimeters below my crease line
1:32so here's the thing this smaller and thinner your eyeliner is the bigger your
1:36eyes will look because you're showing your lips space
1:39be careful not to make your eyeliner shape too big or else you can look like
1:43an anime character
1:48now it's time to curl your lashes to get them nice and perky
1:55what you're going to do is apply mascara on your upper and lower lash line
2:02we move the eyes are done moving on to foundation before you do anything prime
2:08your face
2:08i'm using the same Mirabella one that I used on my eyes
2:13yeah
2:17take your foundation and if you want to match Taylor skin color
2:21she has a very fair complexion so I'm just going to go a few shades lighter
2:24than my own skin color blend away
2:30with a cosmetic sponge dipped in white cream add this to your cheeks nose
2:35bridge and chin to highlight this area
2:41and it's time to bleach my hair so i can turn it blonde
2:44this is honestly the worst week I've ever use
2:47sadly i ordered it online and I didn't try it out before the tutorials so i had
2:52to make do because all the workshops were closed as long as you guys get the
2:55picture
2:56a fake lashes for that extra glam
3:01and if your eyes are blue like Taylor's use blue contacts to match your icon
3:06time to contour your nose and cheekbones
3:08i'm using a matte taupe color you want to make sure that it's matt and don't
3:13use any shimmery bronzer or won't look as natural time to highlight the face
3:21i'm using my Couture is highlighting the sheets I'm just gonna tear one sheet out
3:25and highlight my cheekbones to recreate Taylor's glowing skin and of course you
3:30have to finish off with her signature red lip color I'm going to line my lips
3:36like so and sculpt them in to match her lip shape you want to use concealer
3:46around the lips to create a very precise lip shape
3:52time for the last step just finish off with the red lip gloss of your trace the
3:55red lip gloss that i'm using here is by be a bombshell
3:58it is impossible to go around with red during this holiday season
4:03actually you really don't have to look like taylor to rock this classic look
4:08finished
4:10I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
4:22good luck everyone and don't forget to check out XKCD com the beauty community
4:27i created for you guys
4:28happy holidays
0:00summer is finally here
0:10my favorite part about summer is hanging out with my friends and finding ways to
0:14capture more memories which means i gotta make sure your look at gunpoint
0:20so i'm going to show you how to achieve that glow doing skin that will last
0:24sweats & Son start off with the cleansing wipe and clear off every trace
0:30of leftover makeup dirt and oil
0:33prep the skin with a cooling cucumber facial mask the cucumber works to combat
0:39readiness by soothing this area
0:41just wait 10 minutes and then clean up your face
0:45so i've been using here this nifty new skincare product from Korea
0:49it's called a cool poor stick that provides a thin layer of moisture that
0:53combats dry spots and the best part
0:55it doesn't leave behind a sticky texture now that your skin is prepped
0:59you're ready to move on to make up begin with an oil-free primer and apply this
1:03along any area of the face that tends to get shiny
1:06if you have large pores or fine lines this will soften and reduce the
1:10appearance
1:11i love using a brush whenever i'm applying primer because it really gets
1:15into all the nooks and crannies
1:17moving on to foundation I like to cocktail a few products so I'm mixing in
1:21a dewy formula with my favorite long-wear BB cream that has a built-in
1:26sunscreen
1:27this gives me buildable coverage with a subtle globe
1:30i'm all about that glow
1:31for your under-eye gently . a light concealer and softly to fuse with your
1:41ring finger
1:42now that you've perfected your skin beat your face with a soft translucent powder
1:47to keep everything in place
1:52next add some dimension to your face while warming up your skin with a matte
1:56bronzer bronzer outline of her face like around the temples cheekbones and under
2:01the jaw line
2:02try and keep your application light and let your radiant skin shine through you
2:07should look sunkissed not Burt
2:09cool so moving on to rise prep your lids with a flesh tone base because the skin
2:14around the eye area is so thin blood vessels might show through but a flesh
2:19tone base or concealer will help reduce the appearance and now that your eyes
2:23are primed get a neutral palette that you're crushing on this one's pretty
2:27legit
2:28all right go in with a tan colored shadow and use this as a wash on your
2:33lids to warm up your eyes
2:36yeah
2:38next color up should be am at smoky color add this deep shade all along your
2:43upper and lower lash line and blend it out
2:46we want a nice hazy smoldering look to make sure to blend blend blend it should
2:51be a subtle gradient
2:53here's a fun tip try and use another clean fluffy brush to haze out the color
2:57to maintain dimensionalize take a light nude eyeshadow and pop this color under
3:03your brows along the brow bone and continue blending
3:11time for some shimmer and sparkles find a sparkling peach tone color and paint
3:16this along the inner corner of your eyes to highlight this area using a metallic
3:21copper color add this along the top of your eyelids and softly blend out
3:26highlighting key areas on the eyes will help make them stand out more
3:30if your brows are sparse like mine here find a tough shadow for your brows and
3:34color them in with a brush for a more natural look
3:38I like to top it off with a brow pencil by feathering in the illusion of brow
3:44hairs so try and find a double-ended brow pencil that has both the pencil and
3:49the spoolie I know once my browser set
3:52I feel so much more confident in my face feels complete
3:56oh my dear brow pencil you complete me why use a black eyeliner when there are
4:01so many colors to choose from
4:03summertime should inspire you to try a new eyeliner color just be bold
4:07try a deep teal eye liner and line your eyes as close to the lash line as
4:13possible and pops them along the waterline to intensify the eyes
4:17you don't have to draw a perfect line in one take especially if you have shaky
4:21hands instead you can actually build up the line until you have a flawless shape
4:26i know i said to experiment with more color for your eyeliner but if you
4:31prefer to stick with your trusty old black liner try a gel baseliner instead
4:37this works better during the summertime because one its water resistant into
4:41it's easier to apply try to experiment with different eyeliner brushes until
4:46you find the right one
4:47you feel confident with all you have to do now is curl the lashes as used and
4:52apply several coats of mascara and through your lashes feel fat and juicy
4:57yeah bring in the light with a highlighter makes your highlighter with
5:01a bit of bronzer for that summer glow and touch this across your cheek bones
5:05use a warm highlighter and with a smaller brush dab the highlighter along
5:09the high points on your face for that dewy finish if you want a more natural
5:13look
5:14use the fan brush and sweep the highlighter across your cheeks for
5:18subtle highlight if you happen to be taking photos with flash the light is
5:22going to reflect off the highlighter
5:24so your cheekbones look . for lips there are so many fun colors to choose from a
5:29red a blood orange coral pink or you can try out the new metallic lip trend
5:36yep it's all about the late nineties and early two thousands
5:40you're going to be seeing a lot of metallic textures on the phase fashion
5:44and everywhere
5:45once you're done applying your lip color if you want a full lip allusion to have
5:49a bit of highlighter along your Cupid's bow
5:52I used to color my hair every six months and it became so dry and brittle that
5:57I'm actually taking a break from harsh coloring and instead I'm nourishing the
6:02ends of my hair with hair oil find one that's infused with vitamin E
6:06your hair will thank you in the long run and now you're done

0:00hey gorgeous i'm going to show you how to recreate this spring beauty look
0:04using some of my favorite cruelty products and also i'm going to show you
0:11how to recreate this cute DIY succulent as always start with a clean face d puff
0:17and awaken your eyes using under eye patches or chamomile tea bags
0:21leave them on for a few minutes and remove say bye to your puffiness your
0:25skin is going to feel super refreshed time to prep your makeup so just stipple
0:29on a primer to help smooth out your skin
0:31try to focus around the t-zone area because this is where you're going to
0:35see a lot of shine
0:36keep puffing in whatever is left on the brush and let's move on to brightening
0:39up that I area using a small brush apply concealer gently around your eye area
0:45try to be gentle around this area because the skin around the eyes is very
0:48delicate use any excess product even out dark spots in any blemishes on the skin
0:54I tend to have a lot of redness around my nose engine area so I like to pack on
0:58a little more concealer around here majority of your skin problem is not
1:02what you put on your skin
1:04but what you put in your body and how stressed out you are so try your best
1:08eat healthy and relax the more you're stressed out
1:11the more your skin will show it try using blotting papers to control oil
1:15this is by far my favorite blotting paper brand apparently it's from japan
1:18in geishas use this to touch up your makeup
1:21press them on anywhere to minimize shine and lightly go over them with powder to
1:25enhance the effect
1:26doing this helps keep your powder from looking too cakey also if your boyfriend
1:30is not into makeup
1:32what you want to tone down that shyness and pictures try using this instead of
1:35powder
1:36trust me on this one depending on your skin type if you have oily skin use a
1:40powder highlighter
1:41if you have dry skin use a liquid or cream highlighter highlight your cheeks
1:47and take whatever is left on the brush down your neck and across your shoulders
1:52this will give you that beautiful shimmery glow keep your brows natural by
1:56lightly filling them in and defining their shape with a pencil eyebrows are
2:00very personal and will change as you grow so keep experimenting
2:04once you have a shape you like run the spoolie over your brows to blend the
2:07pencil out this will give it a more natural finish
2:10just keep the hairs in place by sweeping them up and out for the eyes
2:14we're giving them a sweet pastel pop of color take a nude pink and Pat this all
2:18over your lower lash line and lid
2:20this will bring a more romantic mood to your eyes now you can take a pastel blue
2:25color and pass this along your upper lash line bringing the color out blend
2:29out the eye area with a fluffy brush to give your eyes a subtle wash of color
2:34try and keep it light for the liner take an icy blue pencil and place it around
2:39the inner corners to open up your eyes keep lining up words along the inner
2:43half of your lid and into the crease like this to touch right under your brow
2:47bone and blend out to highlight this area and to finish off just set the
2:51cream pencil with an iridescent white eyeshadow
2:56now if you want to make your eyes stand out even more
3:00take a dark eyeliner pencil and tight line your upper and lower waterline
3:04everyone has their favorite way to line their eyes I prefer doing it with a
3:08brush
3:09so with an angled liner brush when it over the pencil and then stay as close
3:13to the lash line as possible
3:15sweep the brush out to create a double wing and don't forget to line along your
3:19lower lash line as well to help balance out your eyes from here just curl your
3:23lashes and apply a few coats of volumizing mascara for that finishing
3:27touch with neutral tone contrast stick to find the shape of your nose
3:34blending as you go with a small fluffy brush this will give you that cute
3:37button nose effect
3:38add dimension to your face by applying some bronzer to scope out your face and
3:44apply blush to add color to your cheeks or lips
3:47line them the nude pink color and fill them in taking a baby pink matte lip
3:53cream place it in the center of your lips and blend it out with a fluffy
3:57eyeshadow brush to keep the color from bleeding
4:00as you can see you have baby dollops clean up the edges of your lips with a
4:03little bit of concealer on a flat synthetic brush
4:06perfect ok so moving on to hear i'm using this rainbow barrel curling iron
4:11to create loose tousled waves
4:13seriously this is the prettiest curling are never right you want them to look
4:16natural and undone so wrap the hair around the barrel
4:20wait a few seconds and release
4:23ok
4:26for nails find a bright vibrant pink or baby blue nail polish to match the
4:33spring colors finish off with perfume that smells like a fresh spring day
4:38personally I love using rollerball perfume because they're super easy to
4:42travel with and you just need to have a little along the wrist like this and
4:46gently press your wrists together for that incident sent add a touch along
4:50your neck line as well

0:07and every one of us has energy pulsing through our bodies and using
0:11state-of-the-art technology we can actually see the electromagnetic waves
0:15we radiate from within these waves are translated into colors so I invited a
0:21team of experienced or photographers to come into the studio for a reading this
0:25machine was able to capture my inner light
0:28each color corresponds with the mood in treat how you feel on the inside
0:32reflects on the outside you might not be able to see the light
0:36but those who are sensitive can sense it I guess you can say this is kind of like
0:40an inner selfie
0:41after seeing my own aura I was inspired to create this dreamy look that will
0:46make it look as if you're glowing from within
0:48all right let your inner beauty shine through by starting with a clean face
0:53i'm using here this soy milk cleanser to keep my skin supple and smooth
0:57put some on your hands and spread it all over your face massage your face as you
1:01go and rinse optically alright so moving on to a mat poor reducing primer evenly
1:07apply this product using a stippling brush
1:10onto the lips you can add a touch of a moisturizing lipstick with a hint of
1:16tint
1:16this will enhance your natural lip color giving your lips and nice flushed
1:21look there is definitely beauty in simplicity time for foundation take a
1:26few pumps on the back of her hand and load some onto your stippling brush
1:30the goal is to avoid covering your entire face
1:33you just want to even out your skin's natural texture and color focus on the
1:38areas around your nose lips and eyes for a bit of coverage around your eyes use a
1:44creamy concealer to conceal your dark circles
1:46try finding a hydrating concealer because you're under eyes tend to be a
1:50little bit more dry than the rest of your face
1:54take a little extra and tap it on as eyeshadow base
1:58remember to be gentle with the delicate skin around your eyes
2:01don't ugh it's totally normal if your lip shape is not even if you want to
2:05reshape them take a little more concealer on a small synthetic brush and
2:10line your lips to even out the shape
2:12afterwards just be sure to blend out with a sponge whatever you have left
2:16over
2:16just even out your eyes and blend that out as well
2:20ok now you can take a nude highlighter and accentuate areas of your face
2:25wherever the light naturally hits your face accentuate that area you can apply
2:30along your brow bones inner corners of your eyes a little on your nose cheeks
2:36and keep its bow
2:38here's a fun tip drawing small crosses on your cheeks will help highlight
2:42without looking too harsh and with a brush slightly blend out the highlighter
2:46light will reflect wherever you apply this highlighter
2:51this will give you that in chanting glow as for your eyes take a sheer creamy eye
2:55shadow and Pat it all over your lids for a wash of color
2:59try finding a beautiful lie light color and if you want to go for a more air
3:04deficit look on your eyes as if light is coming from within
3:08take a frosty white shadow to brighten your inner corners and bring this glow
3:12all the way up to your crease framing the inner half of your eye place any
3:16leftover product on your brow bone and tap it along the lower lash line
3:20this will give your eyes a halo effect on to eyeliner
3:24we don't want this look to appear too harsh so just tight line your eyes by
3:28lifting up your lashes quickly and gently gliding the pencil along the
3:32upper waterline
3:33if your eyes get watery it's totally normal once you tightly under eyes
3:37add some of this pencil eyeliner on an angled brush and wing it along the upper
3:41lashes
3:42let's give some love to your lashes find a mascara with a tiny one this one is
3:46perfect for getting extra close to the roots of your lashes
3:50creating a tight lining effect so come thru your favorite mascara that has a
3:55natural finish you want to make sure to keep your brows looking natural for this
3:58look so use a pencil or powder to fill them in enhance the shape but don't
4:03overdo it
4:04brush the hairs into place and blend out the color if your browser appear drawn
4:08on
4:08try using feathery strokes this will give them a more natural finish
4:12all right take your favorite highlighting powder and we're basically
4:15going to cheat that glow from within
4:17use a tapered brush highlight on the areas on your cheats where light is
4:20naturally hitting it and whatever is left over on your brush
4:24just tap a little on your forehead unless you already have a nice curved
4:28forehead
4:29I'd skip this step continue building up your highlights until you've reached the
4:33glow you're satisfied with using your index or ring finger . some product
4:37under your eyes to punctuate the halo effect and if you want you can even
4:41highlight your collar bones so that the light can reflect off of them and if
4:45you're looking to give your lips that aura like low use a lip liner that
4:49slightly deeper than your natural lip color line your lips and blend it out
4:53just keep repeating until you're happy with the shade and shape of your lips to
4:58soften the look of your lips take a soft pastel lipstick that compliments your
5:02skin tone and place it all over
5:05now with a frosty shadow from before Pat it on the center of your lips
5:10finish it off by adding a nice tinted oil that will add extra moisture and
5:14shine
5:15don't look like the hair it needs to be shiny - I'm a huge believer in using
5:20hair oil take a dime sized amount of argan oil in the palm of her hands and
5:24rub them together to warm up the product and from there just run your fingers
5:28through your hair
5:29focusing on your ends keep finger coming until your hair feel soft and you see
5:33that shine
5:34all right and now you can style your hair I'm going to keep it simple and use
5:38my trusty old hair clip that super 90 is looking
5:42click the sides of your hair back and take a few front pieces to frame your
5:46face and now my dear you're done go out there and let your beautiful or shine

0:00hi beautiful a lot of you have been asking me to create more hair fashion
0:04nail and makeup tutorials so an idea popped in my head
0:07inspired by sailing captain planet these gorgeous ladies here including myself
0:11are combining our forces to create this multifaceted tutorial cosmic candy
0:18ok let's start with Jesse if you're getting bored of your plain black
0:22t-shirt or short
0:23look no further than the stars for inspiration you'll need a few sponges
0:27brushes glitter spray pastel fabric paints and a spray bottle filled with
0:32water
0:33what your sponge and loaded up with the lavender shade start tapping the paint
0:37onto the shorts when you're painting anything Galaxy inspired
0:41it's all about creating depth with these colors make sure to blend out any harsh
0:45edges
0:48now that you have the base done it's time to layer more colors to give your
0:52shorts more dimension take a light neutral shade like a white or silver and
0:56use this as a highlighter wherever it feels two dimensional highlight continue
1:01adding depth using mid tone colors like magenta and teal and you can add that
1:05cosmic touch
1:06I carefully flicking white paint from a small brush
1:09look you just created stars pretty be one with the galaxy shorts blend out the
1:15edges as needed and repeat these steps to continue layering for your desired
1:19look
1:20and if you feel like you're at a good place use your small brush again for the
1:23finishing touches
1:24it's all about the details here you can create starburst planets
1:28whatever for that extra effect spray a little bit of that silver or white color
1:34thus creating a sprinkle of star clusters
1:39yeah
1:41yeah
1:42moving onto Kristin if you want to recreate her out of this world now look
1:46you need to make up brushes
1:48these are denser than regular arts punches and will ensure even application
1:52to start take a protective base coat and layer this on your nails
2:01now you can coat and iridescent white polish on top of the base coat
2:06depending on your polish formula you only need one to two coats
2:12now just top it off with a light pastel pink color because you have several
2:17layers of paint on your nails
2:19you're in this awkward stage where you can't really do anything that requires
2:23serious hand movements so i can watch your favorite show
2:27read a book or go online basically kill time at least 10 minutes for your nails
2:31to dry completely
2:33no one is perfect that's why nail polish remover was invented
2:36so load up an old eyeliner brush with nail polish remover and clean up any
2:41smudges perfect colors you will need are a magenta purple shade a vibrant pink
2:47and a powder blue and if you want a more subtle look focus on creating a
2:51statement nail instead of painting all of them
2:54you can paint directly on the sponge combining all the colors and press this
2:57onto your nail you want to use this time to experiment so
3:01unleash your inner Monet using the pointed edge of a cuticle stick a
3:05toothpick paper clip
3:07basically anything pointing make little crosses and dots to recreate the stars
3:11all right from here just top off your nails with glitter
3:16now it's time to dry that means time to veg out and be a princess because you
3:21can't do anything with wet nails
3:23once you're in the clear add a clear glossy top coat and you're done
3:28so pretty sailor moon would dig this krispies hair color will change
3:32depending on the mood now she's going to show you how to give your hair that
3:36galactic edge using hair chalk
3:39first thing first make sure you're wearing a shirt that you're not going to
3:42miss because talking is messy
3:44the night before prep your hair with a leave-in conditioner because chalk is
3:48drying to begin
3:50take a small section of hair focusing on the ends
3:53place it between the makeup sponge and blue hair truck press lightly and pull
3:57through to get the best color payoff
3:59repeat this step using a green color applying it above the blue for a
4:03gradient effect and after you've done a third of your hair spray it with
4:07hairspray to set it before the color can transfer or shake off
4:11repeat these steps until all your ends have been chopped and set
4:15once you're done show and tell take a selfie aunt Agatha's moving on to Katie
4:21she's here with a space-age lip look just be sure your lips are clean and
4:25prepped take a nude cream lipstick and load this color on your lips
4:30this will neutralize your natural lip tone helping the colors stand out using
4:34a fluffy brush apply a white iridescent loose pigment all over your lips now
4:39with a purple pigment brush this color along the inner corner of your mouth
4:43keeping the color as you go do the same with a teal shade placing it along the
4:48outer inner corner
4:50using a pearly blue color blend out the edges of the teal shadow onto your
4:54Cupid's bow and lower lip and with a bright magenta color do the same to the
4:59purple color and to bridge
5:01everything together use a rose gold color on your lower lip and blend
5:05if you want to accentuate fullness with an iridescent white pigment passed this
5:10along the center of your lower lip to complete your look gorgeous
5:15a unicorn would approve eyes inspired by the bright colors of space start
5:20applying an iridescent vanilla color on your lids as a base using a baby blue
5:26shadow with your shadow brush place this color directly on your crease and blend
5:31back and forth find a map in color and apply the shadow right on the empty spot
5:36focusing on the inner half of your I ready to make your eyes sparkle
5:40literally find a glitter liner that has a purple undertone and draw a line as
5:45close to the lash line as possible
5:48winging it out towards the end with the creamy white eyeliner apply this along
5:52the lower waterline an inner corner for highlighting effect for that bold accent
5:56use an electric blue liner and line your lower lashline gently applying along the
6:02lower water line as well
6:03you want to be sure to stay towards the outer corner of the eye slightly
6:07blending it into the white eye pencil give your lashes a good girl from root

6:51I can spot light your work love you forever dreamers
6:55good luck in your eyes and I license
7:17yeah
0:00Union koala hi gorgeous I have here a beautiful look for you to try out to
0:05ring in the lunar new year
0:07it's the year of the goat or sheep a year of promise and prosperity
0:11before we begin we need to have a fresh clean face
0:15so take a cleansing wipe and gently prep the delicate area under your eyes making
0:20sure that your face is completely clean
0:23we need our skin to be free of any oil and dirt and if my under eyes are
0:27feeling puffy
0:28I'll use the treatment like this to help perk them up it's kind of like a cup of
0:31coffee for the eyes
0:33yep thank the internet for my late nights
0:37let it sit for a few minutes and then just wipe it off with a white clean
0:43tissue
0:45ok now that my eyes are awake one last step before moving on to makeup is
0:50priming the skin find one with a built-in moisturizer a primer helps
0:55create a smoother skin surface minimizing pores and fine lines
1:00however if you're a teenager you can skip primer you don't need this stuff
1:04so to supply this baby all over your face or just spot treat on any problem
1:09areas like an oily t-zone
1:12now you can take a nap of concealer and gently apply under your eyes
1:16you want to be extra gentle because this area is very delicate
1:20all right if you're looking more alive than you are good
1:24so we can now move on to our favorite foundation or BB cream for a while I've
1:29been substituting my foundation with a cushion compact like this one
1:33this was a gift from korea from something that instead of using your
1:37hands or brush cushion compact has a very specific application with the
1:42cushion sponge provided dab it on the sponge soaked in BB or CC cream and very
1:48lightly dab on your face like foundation BB or CC cream from Korea is very
1:54different than BB and CC cream from the West
1:57the coverage is light to medium in the finish is Dewey so i recommend trying
2:01different formulations before settling with your Holy Grail
2:05so continue dabbing the cushion sponge all over your face until you even out
2:09your complexion
2:10when I know how to cheat a flawless complexion use a lightweight highlighter
2:14there are two parts to healthy looking skin complexion and luminosity a
2:19highlighter can help punctuated this by giving you that boost the key
2:23less is more you need just a little small dabs here and there on the high
2:27points of your cheeks and forehead and tip of the nose and Cupid's bow ready to
2:32blush with a shimmering peach blush
2:35loaded up with your brush and locating your cheekbones lightly dust the brush
2:40all over this area
2:41building up the color for this look you don't want to look as if you're wearing
2:46blush it should look as if you're really blushing
2:49all right it's time to move on to the eyebrows if you have sparse brows like
2:53myself here
2:54use a matte powder that's a few shades darker than your own hair color and
2:58lightly fill in your brows
3:02if you need more definition use a brow pencil and sketch little hair marks with
3:08your spoolie brush blend and soften any harsh marks
3:14on to the eyes take a matte taupe eyeshadow color and contour your lids
3:21sweeping the brush back and forth
3:23make sure it's blended we're going for a soft look
3:27yeah
3:30now take a deeper terracotta color and deep in the outer corner blending and
3:35diffusing the color into the creases with a fluffy shadow brush with a
3:43smaller brush use a shimmering sunset peach and build the color up starting
3:49around the inner corner of your eyes and blend out this is going to help warm up
3:53your eyes
3:54tap a small brush into a vanilla highlighter and very carefully blend
3:59into the inner corner of your eyes and along the lower lash line
4:03this will help bring more light to your eyes and dab whatever is left along your
4:07brow bone for extra definition going back with the fluffy brush soften and
4:12blend the colors together using an eyeliner in a plum color carefully
4:17line your upper lashes making sure to stay as close to the lash line as
4:22possible
4:22mmm everyone looks good with the winged eyeliner so go ahead and sketch that
4:27line out make sure it tapers up because this will help lift up your eyes and if
4:33you want a fuller lash line tight line your upper waterline
4:37this might feel uncomfortable at first but believe me it will look good
4:42no pain no game if you want to brighten your eyes take a white eyeliner and
4:47gently line along their lower waterline
4:50and add a touch along the inner corners of your eyes and if you want a more
4:54subtle option
4:55try a peach a rose gold eyeliner you know what time it is time to perk them
5:00lashes
5:01hold your lash curler for a few seconds on each I veteran as so if you're
5:06lacking in the lash Department like myself here
5:09use a lash primer to give your lashes that boost
5:13it's like stilettos for your lashes coat your lashes from root to tip making sure
5:18to flick the wand out at the ends now you can take your favorite jet black
5:23mascara and place it over your lash primer to complete the lashes apply
5:27generous coats
5:30just give the lower lashes and instead mixer taupe and terracotta colors
5:34together and staying as close to the lash line as possible
5:39shadow in this area now it's time for some glam
5:42yes honey but real talk here at the start of the new year fireworks
5:48banging pots and pans basically making real loud noises right after midnight
5:52was said to help ward off any evil spirit and bad luck
5:56instead of fireworks and banging pots and pans i'm going to use this glitter
5:59liner as a symbolic gesture
6:02just place a little around your inner corners to add a fun accent lighting up
6:07your eyes now for those lips in Chinese culture
6:10red is a symbol of happiness and good fortune
6:14so for this look I'm gonna rock a matte red lip
6:17ok so this lip liner has an ankle tip actually pretty useful because I can
6:22create any shape and line with ease
6:25if you want a bold look over draw a little over your Cupid's bow and make
6:29the lines tangled very carefully fill your lips in focusing around the edges
6:36and now it's time to top it off with a red matte lipstick so filling your lips
6:42and get it if you have a dark plum lipstick or eyeshadow softly built
6:51around the corners of your mouth

1:16mmm gotta have them eyebrows on fleek you want to find a color that's two to
1:20three shades darker than your natural hair color or two to three shades

3:14center of your lips and Cupid's bow and if you want to glam it up add a touch of

5:09because people
5:26yeah
5:28yeah
0:00hey guys so this look right here i'm going to show you how to get it
0:04all right let's bring back the nineties with this crunch BTW look
0:10you want to start off with a naked face by wiping it clean with a cotton pad
0:16you should look as if you're not wearing any foundation so try using a BB or CC
0:21cream
0:22that's going to help give you that no makeup look
0:25apply a thin layer on your face and Pat to blend find a concealer that can cover
0:31and lasts a few swipes under your panda eyes is all you really need
0:36and with your ring fingers Pat gently to blend and whatever is left over
0:40just use it around the nose and on your eyelids to reduce redness know you can
0:45use a powder that you're loving and dusted under the eyes
0:48Pat's him on the lids and oily areas on the face to reduce showing if you prefer
0:53having glowing skin just use blotting papers instead of powder
0:56peace out Greece and if you're lacking in the brow department
1:01no worries just use a grayish brown powder to fill in your mouse
1:05this will create the illusion of fuller looking brows use a pencil to draw and
1:11redefine the brow shape sketch little dashes to mimic brow hairs and
1:15use the spoolie brush to soften the marks so that they don't look so drawn
1:19on let's break out your eyeshadows find am a camel color in with your brush all
1:25you really need is an applicator and blender and use this color along the
1:30outer third of your eyes to create the illusion of depth and shadow load a
1:36little bit of the camel color on your blender brush and buff the color along
1:40the outer third again to create a hazy look
1:44follow the natural contours on your eyes you'll notice right away how big they're
1:48gonna look find a mas color with a pearl finish and add this color along the
1:53outer lash line
1:55this is going to help wide in the shape of your eyes giving them a sexy look
2:03and just top off your eye makeup with a metallic gray denim color and you can
2:07use your clean ring finger for this part
2:09just Pat it on the center of the lids and use your brush to feather it out for
2:13smoldering finish if you have a dark brown eyeliner colored use this under
2:18the lower lash line and outer upper lash line
2:21this will help accentuate the shape of your beautiful eyes
2:25if you already have curly lashes just skip this step but if you don't use a
2:31lash curler to perk up the lashes
2:33this opens up the eyes right away find a mascara that can give you sky-high
2:38lashes sweep generous codes through the lashes and watch them grow and just keep
2:44applying generous coats until you've reached the length you're happy with
2:47because we're going to use a lip liner prep your lips first with a lip balm and
2:52i'm just going to use a very light layer of my pillow plush and berries for the
2:56cheeks you can either contour for that supermodel circulated cheekbones or use
3:02a multi blush for a light touch of color on the cheeks trying to avoid pink and
3:07peach
3:07it's not going to work with this color palette add this on the cheekbones and
3:11blend with your fingers
3:13another way to apply is too low the color directly on your fingers first
3:17quickly padding the cheek area for that blushing finish with the dark red or
3:22plan what color outline your lips first
3:25this will prevent your lip color from feather and then just fill in your lips
3:29to help boost the longevity of your lip color
3:33very nice onto the lip color find a dark plum or oxblood lip color and paint this
3:42rich color on the lips
3:44try and use a brush especially when you're working with a dark color so that
3:48you can have an even application
4:01and for my nails I decided to wear a dark red wine color
4:06who would have guessed they now make hair CC cream crazy
4:10so use your favorite styling cream and warm it up between your fingers breasts
4:14before running them through the hair for that texture bedhead finish
4:24looking good and if you want that finishing touch
4:28just enhance your scent with a light fragrance and this is why i love
4:32rollerball fragrances because a light touch on my wrist is all I really need
4:37and if you want to grab that special someone's attention just add a little
4:41bit behind your ears
4:42normal soon you should smell as good as you look
4:46all right beautiful just share your brunch beauty look to me by hashtagging
4:50mish look and if you happen to get lipstick on your teeth
4:57just use the thumb sucking technique and you'll be good to go
5:01all right everyone i hope you had fun with this tutorial and good luck
5:18yeah
0:00yeah
0:02yeah
0:04hey gorges I have an enchanting beauty look for you to try out
0:09it's perfect for a music festival or any summer parties start with a cc or BB
0:16cream and lightly Pat this over your entire face with your clean hands
0:25the stream you can also use a foundation or stippling brush or sponge
0:33concealer should be used sparingly remember a little goes a long way
0:38all you really need is one swipe under the eyes down the bridge of your nose
0:42for highlighter around the sides of the nose and mouth to cover up any redness
0:46and all blemishes
0:47try using your fingers to apply this warms up the product and makes the
0:52application smoother and easier blend away for a flawless finish
0:57as of lately I've been using to brow pencils to fill in my brows
1:03if you ever look closely at your brows you might notice that towards the inner
1:06corners they're more sparse and towards the end there more full your brows don't
1:11have to match your hair color
1:13you should either be darker or lighter depending on the look you're going for
1:20on the ice start with a matte cream base to even out the color of your lids
1:29next apply a shimmering lavender color along the crease of your eye and blend
1:34away
1:35this will give your eyes a tin chanting mood through the canyon
1:42the next step take a light pink eyeshadow and apply this all over the
1:47lids and blend up into the crease you wanted to look as light and airy as
1:51possible
1:53add more dimension to your eyes with highlighter lift up the eyes with a hint
1:58of shimmer along the inner corner of your eyes and brow bone
2:08to open up your eyes for that summary look use a sunshine yellow eyeliner on
2:13the bottom waterline
2:16notice how much brighter the eyes look your eyes will definitely stand out in
2:20pictures to really give this look a bowl pop use a vibrant blue or teal color to
2:26line the top and bottom lash line
2:28i'm going to start with the lower lash line first keeping the line thin now
2:33just lie in the upper lashline staying as close to the lash line as possible to
2:37intensify the eye makeup
2:43and extend out to form a cat eye
2:50gently soften the edges with a clean brush
2:53this will give your eye makeup that theory look and if you're looking for a
2:58more subtle look just switch out the blue liner for something more delicate
3:01and natural like a navy or dark brown almost done with the eye makeup
3:06we just need a few swipes of your trusty little mascara for perky lashes finish
3:10off your summer look with a beautiful baby pink lipstick
3:13keep your lip color natural because this look is all about your eyes as much
3:19there's no ax to bold or too simple that's not worth your self expression i
3:24challenge you to explore and test your boundaries play with color patterns and
3:28styles and looks
3:30I believe there's an artist and everyone
3:33so let's find the artist within you break out your pencil and paper because
3:36i'm going to show you how to draw a beautiful face with the light hand start
3:40out with the circle the most fundamental shape doesn't have to be perfect from
3:44here draw across and split the circle in half
3:47follow the horizontal corners of the cross and create a triangle shape
3:51this marks the chin area and on the horizontal line of the cross marks where
3:55the I should be in the ears should line up to the eyes the nose will sit around
4:00the bottom of the circle and the lips will be within this area
4:04so take this time to flesh out the face shape you can create cute chubby cheeks
4:08supermodel sunken cheekbones or whatever draw what makes you feel better
4:12and once you have a general idea start erasing the guidelines to reveal your
4:17face shape
4:18everyone has a signature way to draw nigh so take this time to play around
4:22with different shapes for a basic almond-shaped I draw a curve and draw
4:27the bottom lashline feather out some lashes to open up the eyes and draw a
4:32rectangle shape to create a reflection in the eye and repeat the same step for
4:36the other hand
4:38and after your eyes are drawn it's time to erase the guidelines
4:43take this time to add in the details for the eyes
4:47just two simple marks for the nostril and a line for the nose bridge
4:50as for the lips keep the lines curvy and soft so here's where the beauty
4:54techniques help Heather at the lines to create subtle brow hairs as if you're
4:58really filling in your brows as for the hair
5:01start with the hairline and work your way out to create the full hair shape
5:05touch up the makeup if needed and if you want to play up your fashion or jewelry
5:10designing side draw your own designs on her ear and neck

5:44I had my own mural painted on a giant wall in Soho New York
5:48these guys are on another level that's some impressive painting right there
5:52they changed up the mural every week to coincide with the beauty video i was
5:56uploading that week
5:57it started off with an Egyptian queen lip and natural everyday look
6:02a robotic chic look and lastly a unicorn look crazy talented huh
6:13I've been away for a while and I really missed you guys
6:19I spent an entire month just traveling for work and decided to take a week-long
6:23vacation in Korea with tom
6:25I had the most incredible time there I can't wait to share my travel diary with
6:30you
6:31I can already tell that this is going to be an unforgettable summer
6:50can't wait to see you guys on the next video don't forget to subscribe for more
6:55love you
7:04yeah
0:00who knows what's gonna happen in the future
0:07I say live for today and dream for tomorrow because nothing is ever
0:11promised
0:13yeah
0:21ok
0:25before applying makeup
0:29make sure your face is polished and moisturised i recommend exfoliating your
0:33skin twice a week
0:34if you have normal to dry skin three times a week if you have oily skin and
0:40if exfoliating is too harsh on your sensitive skin
0:43try using a gentle makeup cleanser instead try and avoid any products with
0:48harsh chemicals so that it doesn't irritate your skin find one that has
0:52natural ingredients and once you're all skincare it up and you want to boost
0:56your makeups longevity use a mattifying face primer apply this product on any
1:01oily spots on your face like your nose and forehead
1:04really work the product onto your skin because you're creating a barrier
1:08between your skincare and makeup and once you're all primed up
1:11let's get started with face makeup using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream
1:16and with your clean fingers brush or my current fav Christian cream sponge apply
1:21your product evenly on your face and back to blend out to create a smooth
1:25even finish
1:29perhaps in the future dark circles will be a thing in the past but for now
1:34concealer will do the trick find a neutralizing concealer that can cover up
1:38those dark circles
1:39especially for any of you who aren't getting enough sleep you want to find a
1:42product that will offer high coverage you'll find that you're going to use
1:46less product and it will look much more natural and less Kiki
1:50ok so powder way to steal your face makeup in
1:58undo the browse some people don't need to touch them but for the rest of us
2:03filling and reshaping them can make a world of a difference
2:07don't believe me watch a little flake here and there and watch your brows come
2:11to life with the black trim the eyeliner take the time to run the pencil along
2:22your lash line and feather it out and if you're going for a nonchalant look stop
2:30here
2:30but if you want to clean it up and give your line and nice edge use an angled
2:34liner brush and start smudging a line to sculpt your perfect liner shape
2:39try and find a creamy eye liner for this technique or else it might get a little
2:44draggy and we don't want that
2:46not for your delicate eyes find the natural contours of your eyes but
2:52instead of marking it here
2:54go a tiny bit higher to elevate your eyelid shape
2:58I know this sounds weird but trust me take your blending brush and blend out
3:01the upper line for a softer look
3:06Carol it up and sweet generous coats of your favorite lash lengthening mascara
3:18lashes are a nice I accessory to play around with
3:22but some parts of the world people wear fake lashes every day
3:25it's part of their daily routine and that's why it's important for them to
3:29find fake lashes that feels like you're wearing nothing at all
3:32remember when I elevated my crease line higher
3:36well it's because i'm going to use my favorite eyelet 8 by dup it's a Japanese
3:41medical grade I'll aight aight that safe and gentle to use on the eyes
3:45I've been using these for years and I square by them eyelid tape can give you
3:48the ability to transform your eye shape
3:51it's super easy to use and by the way i recommend doing this before makeup but I
3:56wanted to show you this trick near the end to give you the complete
3:58transformation
4:01using the tool provided insert the double-sided tape into the desired
4:05crease spot you want to find where you want your crease to be and adjust
4:11accordingly to make sure everything is sticking properly
4:14it takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it you'll have so
4:18much fun creating different looks almost done with the makeup
4:24let's add some color to your cheeks i'm going to use a natural-looking pink
4:28blush on my cheeks pad to blend with your fingers or a brush and for my lips
4:34I'm going to use a nude lipliner pencil and i'm also going to double it up as
4:38the lip color focus on the middle section of your upper and bottom lip
4:42this will give you the illusion of fuller lips
4:47and using the same pink color I had on my cheeks
4:51add this along the outer corners on your lips for that three-dimensional look and
4:57if you want to be looking skin use this korean skin illuminator
5:01it's such a pretty youthful look that will give you that playful finish
5:04because if your face is too Matt it might make your face appear flat looking
5:09for the nails

0:16hey everyone i have here an edgy look for you to try out
0:32have your face foundation ready and let's go
0:35because this look is so I heavy fill in and shape your brows first your brows
0:40are the frames to your eyes for this look I recommend keeping your brows skin
0:45here with a higher arch you want to find a brow pencil that has a whack space so
0:50that when you fill them in the wax will lay the hairs down so that they don't
0:54stick up just create little strokes and watch your brows magically come to life
1:01try and use a fully to blend out the marks to help soften the look so that
1:05your brows don't look as if they're drawn on
1:08but for some of you who don't need to fill in your brows well aren't you lucky
1:13using hear my new york city smokies palette or just find any silver smoky
1:18eyeshadow palette apply a shimmering pale peach color on your legs
1:22the trick to using silver eyeshadow is to make sure your base is warm
1:26silver can make your eyes look a little bit too cold
1:30like steel so warm it up with a soft color
1:33now select the metallic medium gray color and using a small brush create an
1:40edge by following the natural line of your I dabbing the brush along the way
1:44and once you have the cat eye shape fill in only the outer corner of your eyes
1:50leaving the rest of your I clean
1:54ok so now that you have your vixen cat eyes in place
1:57let's break out your liquid liner i'm using here my new scribble liquid liner
2:01that just launched in tattoo black
2:03I decided to name its Gribble because you can create thin and thick lines with
2:07the flick of the brush if you want to find the perfect liquid liner
2:11look for a brush that's flexible and can give you the greatest control the
2:15formula has to be smooth
2:17you should be able to create the perfect line with ease
2:20no skipping or dragoness so draw your lines so that it contours with the cat
2:25eye and if you want to go a little more Egyptian on this look because it's so
2:29popular draw another thin line under the first one for that exotic look
2:36take your time when you're creating your new lines we all know that liquid liner
2:40is not the most forgiving beauty product but once you've mastered the line you
2:44can create endless looks alright just curl your lashes and give them a few
2:49good squeezes your lashes are supposed to look curled not cramped and from here
2:56just apply a clean lash lengthening mascara
2:59I would avoid dramatic lashes since this look is all about the eyeliner and if
3:04you want to balance out your eyes
3:06just apply mascara on your lower lashes
3:19of course i'm using here my favorite water liner in rose gold
3:24i'm going to apply this along the inner corners of my eyes and water line to
3:27help brighten them up
3:36and because i'm feeling a little fancy i'm going to add silver lining inside
3:40the empty eyeliner space and if you're feeling ambitious create a very very
3:46thin outline along the cat eye shape
3:57this is going to give you a fun graphic look
4:00yeah
4:01from here just contour into your thing because this look is so sharp and edgy
4:07I want my nice to look a little more defined

0:05about you
0:06all right start out with a bare face and let's get to work
0:11the dab of foundation can go a long way
0:15look for a product that has a matte or shine free finish with the foundation
0:20brush or a sponge create and natural skin texture on your face
0:24this will help create an airbrush finish
0:28make sure everything is blended away and let's move on to the next step
0:33powdering your face if you want to maintain the longevity of your face
0:39makeup use a matte powder
0:41try not to use powder all over your face just along the areas under the eyes
0:45around the nose chin forehead to reduce shininess dab away and set the powder
0:51concentrating under the eyes and on the t-zone
0:54once you're done with foundation and powder let's move on to your brows
0:58perfectly arched dark brow helps to find this look
1:06if you really want to perfect the arch of your brows try drawing
1:09indistinct line through the brow to give you direction and shape and afterwards
1:15just fill it in and blend away try experimenting with different color
1:18shades for your brows
1:20you might be surprised by how much it can change up your look
1:23and now that you have the perfect base in canvas
1:27it's time for the fun part adding color and definition
1:30i'm using here this nice matte multiple it's perfect for a matte look you want
1:35to use a product that has a strong color payoff
1:37so that you just need a little bit less is more
1:41another way to use matte multiple is too wet your hands first and then touch the
1:45multiple and start applying the product on your face and just passed this on
1:50your cheeks for that second skin finish your contour shade should always be Matt
1:54shininess draws more attention to features and makes them more prominent
1:59while darker matte shades creates more depth and once you've laid out your
2:03color blend away to shear perfection
2:20I'm all about multifunctional tools so the more ways you can use a product
2:24better if you want a more bronze kiss look use this along your forehead for
2:29that summer look
2:38just keep lending away and let's move on
2:45on the eyes Matt of shadow is all you need
2:48this is an essential must have color for your eyes especially if you need to
2:53contour your eyes
2:54add this along the hollows of your eyes to create more depth
2:57my sig and using a dark brown color line your eyes
3:01upper and lower to create the illusion of bigger looking eyes
3:14pop of color like pink is perfect for the cheeks
3:18even though the product is matt still brings life in dimension back to your
3:22face
3:23rosy pink cheeks are perfect for spring look to add this on the high points on
3:27your face
3:33all right you know this step curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for
3:37mascara
3:38once your lashes are curled apply a volumizing mascara that you can build up
3:43with several codes from there
3:49finish up your lips with a rosy pink matte color to soften your look if you
3:53want balance you need to have the opposite
3:56so i'm using here a metallic rose gold eyeliner on my waterline to help right
4:01in my eyes
4:02just because we're creating a matte look doesn't mean everything has to have a
4:05matte finish
4:06I'm all for shiny hair once it starts looking Gracie
4:11we should fix this that's why a dry shampoo is a must have for me if you
4:17want to stay on trend find a bright pastel nail color shiny or not using a
4:22mattifying top coat will instantly modify your nails or you can you Steve
4:30- have fun trying this new spring trends that make up that hair and nails
4:35don't be scared to experiment you never know what you'll discover

5:00yeah
0:00a selfie is like a self-portrait you want to capture the best version of
0:05yourself right
0:06and after that there are so many filters you can choose to help enhance your
0:10picture
0:11well in this video I'm going to show you how to enhance your skin without the
0:15need of a filter
0:16let's start with basic skin care step one cleanser use a cleanser that works
0:22for your skin type is it tries boilie normal or a combination like myself real
0:28of them
0:29if you have a dry skin type use the cream cleanser and if it's oily use a
0:33gel cleanser and if you're looking to exfoliate your skin wash your face with
0:37a washcloth to gently scrub away to reveal perfectly polished skin feels
0:46gonna step number two you
0:49I cream
0:51and you really just need a pea sized amount
0:54use your ring fingers and start patting it on like this
0:59your ring finger is the most delicate finger try not to stretch or tug this
1:03area around just softly have the product around your eye area
1:07step number three skin serum a sara is very concentrated
1:12two pumps is all you need to do and apply this all over your face and neck
1:19think of a ceremony like a supercharged booster for your skin care routine
1:23some are made to help reduce aging and at me others can brighten and repair the
1:28skin
1:28step number four moisturizer or lotion a dime sized amount is all you need and
1:36apply this all over your face and neck after washing your face that healthy
1:40sebum layer is gone
1:41so by using moisturizer you're recreating that barrier to keep
1:45hydration locked in a lot of moisturizers can prevent water loss next
1:50step lip balm
1:51i'm assuming most of you are already using a lip balm
1:55if not find a lip balm that works well for you no different from using a
1:59moisturizer on your skin
2:00lip balm will help keep your lips from drying out locking moisture in
2:04no makeup all skincare
2:06get your foundation and blush ready i'm using here my love me for me foundation
2:11in shell number nine and then with my rounded foundation brush start applying
2:16the foundation around the center of your face and forehead first cover up any
2:20redness and even out your skin
2:23after foundation if you need to cover up any spots or dark areas use concealer
2:29most people have dark circles so it's not a big deal with people see you with
2:33them but then again i know people who look better with their dark circles
2:37kind of like a vampire but if you look more like a zombie
2:41try to reduce them by lightly concealing them it's not about erasing them
2:45it's about lightening up the dark area will make a huge difference
2:49see before we finish the face makeup
2:52you have to seal everything in with powder you can either use translucent
2:56powder or a powder that has coverage like the one I'm using here like
3:00foundation start around the center of your face and move out so that in photos
3:05of filter won't be needed to perfect my skin
3:10and right now if you purchase ends love me for me powder compact you get a
3:14matching foundation for free
3:16all right let's get back to this tutorial for my brows if i'm looking for
3:19a softer look I prefer using a brow powder or an eyeshadow that matches your
3:24brow color you want to make sure you're using an angled eyeliner brush to give
3:29you better precision when you're creating your brow shape I like to draw
3:32a line on the bottom of my brows first so that I can see what my brows will
3:37look like before filling them in and from there
3:40just make little strokes to create the illusion of brow hairs and lightly brush
3:45with a spoolie to soften your browse
3:46ok we all know this step curling the lashes my lashes are not curly and they
3:52grow straight down so i personally have to curl my lashes to lift them up
3:56however if you have naturally curly lashes well aren't you lucky ducky use
4:01the lash lengthening mascara because we want long clean looking lashes
4:05alright final step taking care of your hair I color my hair a lot lately i've
4:11been using leaving conditioner and hair oils to replenish my her
4:16yeah
4:17so we're done no filter needed good skin care and foundation
4:22never hurts but a smile is all you need
4:26good luck

0:00you know there are days when you just can't get her hair to look right
0:04but then we have those days when we look and feel like the Queen because I want
0:13my skin to look flawless

0:19guys who want to reduce shiny face without the makeup look smooth this all
0:24over your face and let's move on to concealing take your favorite concealer
0:29i'm using here my trusty old great cover up concealer and with my Beauty Blender
0:33sponge I have right here i'm going to show you my current face makeup routine
0:37with a little bit of concealer on the sponge
0:40I'm dabbing a Touch under my eyes to brighten and conceal any of the dark
0:44areas and sometimes what I'll do is add a lighter concealer shade around my
0:49cheek area to create the illusion of fuller looking cheeks so just smooth
0:54everything out and powder up
0:56you can either use a sponge a powder brush or a powder puff to gently apply
1:01the powder on the area where you used concealer or foundation if your
1:05foundation or concealer has a matte finish
1:08you can skip this step all right time for the brows
1:11i'm going to be using two pencils and a brow filler to create my brow look for
1:16today
1:17I'm taking my brow pencils here called arch and using a color that matches my
1:21draw hair
1:22I'm going to fill in my brows if you naturally have full brows
1:25you might not need much work however for me I have to literally draw my brows on
1:31by creating feathery strokes
1:33once you're done creating your brow shape an extra step I like to do is add
1:37a brow filler brush this over your brows and you'll notice right away how natural
1:41they look find an eyeliner or eyeshadow in an amethyst color and outline the
1:46outer third of your eyes
1:48what you want to do is create a wing shape just by following your natural
1:52contour and from here

0:03Ben and I were fighting this shark and science cat and I lost track of time
0:07anyway I'm here now milady and I have brought to you half an orange LOL nice
0:16now make that green there dude yeah that's good
0:21oh and young ja okay yep
0:24again can be actually dad and that's better
0:29hi had to make sure my translator was on so what do you get when you combine a
0:34unicorn with a rainbow a Rainicorn inspired by one of my favorite
0:39enchanting characters in Adventure Time Lady has perfectly pink skin
0:44so begin by lightly stippling on a base of BB cream or liquid foundation
0:49I prefer using a BB or CC cream because it feels lighter than foundation
0:54plus it has a moisturizing base will also help moisturize your skin - BAM
1:00the power of good concealer is pretty much as good as magic
1:03you can use your ring finger to blend or do what I'm doing taking the back of the
1:08brush and having to blend
1:10all right now we take a cherry red lip balm and dab it on the lips to prep and
1:15soften them for later
1:16I'm gonna throw on some blue contacts circle lens better yet if you want to
1:21give your eyes a more magical lip and now that your eyes are magical next step
1:26will require crime in your eyes I'm using here a champagne shadow primer
1:30gently dabbing it on my lids
1:38with the ring finger apply a bright yellow on the center of the lid
1:43this will be the base color for the rainbow with another clean finger or a
1:55brush apply a sky-blue along the outside corner of the eye pad on and blend
2:01around the corners to soften the edge node of your brush with the shimmery
2:10lighter blue and blend into the crease adding as you move along the eye for
2:15more control
2:23take a blending brush and blend to soften the edge
2:28let's try to keep this looks soft like a cotton Kenny and now take a hopping
2:34shadow and to create that beautiful rainbow effect take a flat side shadow
2:38brush and dab this color into the crease you want to try and keep the line subtle
2:42pink is a very strong color if you used too much it might over on the ice
2:48a rainbow is created when light is reflected through droplets of water in
2:52the sky to give that shimmery effect of water droplets apply a sparkly shadow on
2:57the brow bone the next color will be purple with a smaller brush at this
3:02along the lower lash line to balance out the eyes
3:04you want to make sure to add a cooler color on the bottom since we have pink
3:08on top on the inner corner of the eye by the tear duct apply a shimmering white
3:13shadow to brighten up this look
3:17all right take out your black liquid liner gently feather out a black liquid
3:24liner on the top corner of the eye
3:26keep the line thin we want to make sure that your eyes are as open and as round
3:30as possible
3:31just like ladies so that means curling your lashes and applying generous coats
3:35of mascara
3:43Lady Rainicorn doesn't have very defined eyebrows
3:50so this brow look is really up to you I want to try and keep this natural
3:54looking so gently
3:56fill in your brows with the neutral tone color close to your natural hair color
3:59because I'm wearing a blond way to match ladies here
4:05brush a little bit of a blonde brow gel over your brows to lightly 10 them to
4:14really make the eyes pop line the bottom waterline with a rose gold liner
4:18this will really open up your eyes more for the lashes
4:25I need a little more help in this department so i'm going to apply
4:28individual lashes the trick for this step is to use a clear glue and to apply
4:34with the term user so that you have better precision
4:36ok so now you're ready to move on to the rest of the face for your cheeks are
4:42rosy pink cream blush will do the trick
4:45apply this on the upper cheek bones and blend it out with a fluffy kabuki brush
4:50because you might need a little more definition around the cheekbones take a
4:54bronzing blush powder and apply this on the apples of the cheeks
4:58blending to the outer corner of the face as you go
5:03Lady Rainicorn has a delicate small mouth
5:06so if you have bullets take your concealer that matches with your skin
5:10tone and erase the sides of your lips
5:12this is going to create the illusion of a smaller mouth
5:16you want to make sure to blend so it doesn't get cakey and after this just
5:21powder to make sure the concealer doesn't slip inside
5:25all right time for some color use a pink or a rose lip color and apply this along
5:31the opening of your mouth to create a sweet delicate look this look is very
5:37innocent looking perfect for a lady
5:41all right now your magical look is complete
5:45magical colorful and completely adorable
5:48this is Lady Rainicorn
6:00now all you have to do is learn Korean and find your boyfriend Jake
6:13oh okay Cisco
6:16Oh responded to our calls out about vision to study English gonna buy this
6:22one device against me on a penguin or media and that means good luck
6:30ingredients
6:43yeah
0:00giving it again again again and that's winning game that swing game and that
0:03swing and again again again again
0:06a few minutes me and the roaring twenties i think i was born in the wrong
0:15era but with a little help from my friend called makeup
0:19I can transform myself into the ultimate flapper girl
0:22let's start off with foundation to help even out your skin with the stippling
0:25brush sponge or your clean fingers
0:28apply your foundation on your face I prefer to apply my foundation first
0:33around the center of my face because I need a little more coverage here then
0:38the rest of my face
0:39like forehead engine just make sure to blend so you don't have any Street marks
0:43especially down towards your neck
0:46all right let's move on to the heavy duty stuff
0:50concealing i'm curious to know what kind of makeup they use during the twenties
0:55to achieve perfect looking skin
0:57today we use stuff like a peachy salmon concealer color because it works wonders
1:02on covering up dark circles
1:04I prefer to use my gentle ring finger to apply concealer along the delicate area
1:09under my eyes
1:10all right this step is important applying finishing powder on your face
1:14to set the liquid and cream base makeup
1:17this will stop it from creasing and will also keep your makeup looking fresh all
1:21night long to make sure your skin has a matte finish
1:24let's move on to the fun part making up the eyes I'm using here my new brow
1:29pencils that just came in called arch by em cosmetics
1:33i'm using here the color medium brown and very carefully
1:36create your arch skinny over-exaggerated browse was the look
1:41unlike today where full brows are in back then
1:45every girl was drawing on her brows super thin just like Clara Bow 1920
1:50silent film star
1:51let's hurry up with eyeshadow with the medium brush loaded up with the matte
1:56taupe color and follow the natural contours of your eyes
2:04and once you're happy with how it looks
2:08the next color you should use is a matte black shadow and with the same brush use
2:13this to contour your crease again only this time it's going to look more
2:17intense in the taupe color
2:19what you're doing here is creating a strong contour shape to your eyes
2:23this will give your eyes more depth when I was coming up at this look I was
2:27really inspired by silent film movies
2:30be sure to keep the middle area on your legs clean will fill them in later
2:34so keep blending and bring the color down along the lower lash line
2:40this will help make your eyes appear more round use a shimmery my shadow
2:46add this on the area that you kept clean to fill it in with your brush again
2:51blend the shadow so that you don't have any harsh edge and using your black
2:59eyeliner here i'm using my water liner in black knight line the waterline
3:04gliding the pencil back and forth until you're happy with the intensity then
3:08bring the pencil up keeping the pencil as close to the lash line as possible
3:12and line your eyes
3:14we want to make sure that the line is as thin as possible so just keep darkening
3:18your eye makeup and with this measure tool smudge the creamy eye liner formula
3:22so that it gives your eyes a hazy look
3:31using another brush that has the same taupe color on it start where your brows
3:37begin and follow the line down the sides of your nose contouring your nose will
3:41help bring more definition to your face and after you curl your lashes apply
3:46generous coats of waterproof mascara
3:48why waterproof because it contains wax which will help hold a curl longer and
3:56when you're done with your eyes
3:57let's move on to the lips but first we have to reshape them
4:01this is a modern take on the Clara Bow lips with the concealer that matches
4:06your skin color start erasing the sides of your lips
4:09he want them to look smaller than normal we're creating very delicate shaped lips
4:14imagine if your lips were shaped like a heart that's kind of what we're going
4:18for
4:18so conceal a small portion of your upper lip and blend the concealer so that it
4:23looks as natural as possible using your powder again set the makeup
4:28you can't skip this step or else your lipstick and concealer will slip and
4:32slide find a rich red lipstick with the matte finish here i'm using my new matte
4:37lipstick in wine stain using a brush line your lips first then fill in the
4:42color you want your Cupid's bow to look extra point II think of it like two
4:46little mountain peaks
4:50haha you're not done yet
4:53you got a layer a darker plum color over the red to create a gorgeous rich
4:57vintage-inspired color so keep lending way did you know that back then it was
5:03extremely fashionable to be seen applying lipstick in public
5:07ladies would apply their lipstick and powder their faces right at the
5:11restaurant table
5:12there is no need to run to the bathroom for touch-ups and voila you're finished
5:16and now it's time to play dress-up

0:06sound strange but it's actually very popular in Asia
0:09it makes your eyes appear more cheerful giving you a youthful look if you
0:13already have puffy eyes
0:15this will be a no-brainer but if you don't i'll show you how to recreate them
0:19all right let's start with the brows first i'm using here a dual brow powder
0:23set
0:24that's going to help me create natural looking brows
0:27I like to start at the bottom part of my brows and work my way up to reshape your
0:33brows until you're happy with the look
0:35remember they don't have to look identical identical looking brows can
0:38sometimes appear to artificial looking so if they're slightly off
0:43that's totally fine moving on to the eye makeup
0:46i'm going to use this L'Oreal eyeshadow quad that I've had for ages use a
0:50combination of the white and shimmering peachy pink and add this along the lower
0:55lash line highlight under your eyes to create an illusion of happiness
1:02now with this matte taupe or brown color
1:08softly create a line underneath the highlighting color this will give an
1:11illusion of a shadow use a combination of a darker Matt Brown along the outer
1:16part to create an illusion of depth and with your blending brush gently soften
1:21the make up to the point where it looks like a natural shadow
1:28now bring the highlighting color up and blend out this will help open up your
1:32eyes
1:38this part is extremely important
1:41conceal any dark circles if you don't this will make your eyes appear more
1:45tired and instead of the cute puppy eyes you end up with baggy zombie is so
1:50definitely conceal
1:53try not to cover up the fake shadows that you just created
1:58once you're done let's move on
2:02now just powder the rest of your face
2:06you don't want your face to look shiny or else the puppy eyes won't stand out
2:10as much
2:13take this time to line your eyes it's important to keep the line as thin as
2:16possible
2:21so just even out both eyes and Rome is done now curl your lashes and get them
2:36nice and perky
2:37this will help open up your eyes
2:41time for mascara add a few generous coats on your lashes
2:46you don't want your lashes to appear too dramatic keep them long and
2:50natural-looking
2:53time to break out your sponge loaded up with concealer and conceal the outer
2:59edge of your lips
3:00I usually prefer sporting fuller looking lips but if you pair your cute puppy
3:05eyes with smaller gentle lips
3:07you're going to look like a doll so dab your favorite bright lip color along the
3:11center of your lips and blend out
3:13this isn't a gradient lip look I'm just making my lips appear a tad bit smaller
3:18and that's pretty much it

0:38wait five minutes and rinse it off your skin is going to feel like butter and
0:41your acne or fade away tuesday and wednesday should be the days to brighten
0:45your skin

0:49lemon and sugar and exfoliate your skin with this lemon has active ingredients
0:54that will help brighten and lighten your skin while the sugar will help exfoliate
0:58any dead skin cells on your face

1:19appealing mask on your skin will help draw out any impurities and excess oil
1:24from your skin peeling ask are always fun because it goes on GUI then it dries
1:29to a point where you can't even move your face and then when you're paying it
1:32off
1:33it's the weirdest most satisfying feeling your skin will feel squeaky
1:41clean
1:42make sure to always give your skin some love by nurturing it
1:45I do this by applying collagen mask on my face these masks are amazing and they
1:50always come to the rescue for me especially when my skin is feeling a bit
1:53dry adult applying these babies on is like the equivalent of going to a facial
1:58spot without the big bucks now just relax and this part is always awkward
2:03because you look like you're about to kill someone
2:09wait 10 minutes and then remove rub whatever is left over on your face and
2:13neck

2:25moisturizing your skin if you want healthy skin
2:28you gotta feed it with good stuff if you think you're too young to use any anti
2:32aging products
2:33think again part of slowing the aging process down is preventing an early eh
2:38that means using sunscreen and finding good effective products that helps
2:42produce more collagen and reduce wrinkles
2:55it's always best to use an eye cream to moisturize your eyes
3:01the reason why is because the under eyes are so delicate and you don't want to
3:04slather on random stuff under your eyes
3:12try your best every night to pamper your skin your best skin care products when
3:17you're sleeping
3:18your body is repairing itself especially your skin so this is a time to use
3:22special skin care products especially product that contains retinol retinol is

0:45concealer because this is a more glamorous look I'm going to use a
0:49slightly lighter foundation for more luminous field
0:54and now to set your foundation with pattern
1:00next step I'm going to accentuate my brows by filling them in and giving them
1:03more definition and shape
1:09with an angled brush and gel liner I'm creating a subtle wing look
1:18to brighten up my eyes i'm highlighting the inner corners with the white
1:22shimmery eyeshadow
1:28to help bring in more definition to the eyes line the lower lash line and then
1:32connect it to the upper lash line
1:40and of course curl your lashes and apply mascara with this look
1:45I definitely want to add more volume with my lashes so it's time to add some
1:48false lashes
1:50you want to try and cut the lashes first and with the glue still a little bit
1:54tacky place the lashes on your upper lashline building the lashes as you go
2:03picture once they're dry go over with liquid liner to help them blend in
2:11and now your eyes are complete for the blush i'm going to use a pink powder
2:15blush to really define my cheekbones
2:20afterwards I'm going to contour my nose and highlight the bridge of my nose and
2:24right above the cheekbone
2:25this will help bring in more definition to my face
2:28taking a red lip liner line the lips and fill it in with the color
2:38and then just finish it off with a lip brush as red tends to move easily over
2:42the lip line
2:43i also like to punch up the lip color with a little bit of gloss on the center
2:46of my lips to create an illusion of fuller looking lips and now you're ready
2:51to walk down the aisle looking glamorous but you can easily change up this look
2:55and make it more sultry with a few minor changes you'll be keeping the same eyes
3:00foundation and blush from the last look but changing up the eyes and lips for
3:04this step just lighten up the ice use a shade that's a few shades lighter to
3:08help brighten up the eyes
3:12apply a brown shadow to the outer corners of the eyes in a v-shape and
3:16work it into the crease to create more depth and definition to the ice
3:22highlight the brow bone and then deep in the liner to create a smoke your cat I
3:26the contrast of light and shadow really helps make the eyes appear more sultry
3:34deep in the blush and create even more definition to the cheekbone
3:40with the light neutral liner and lipstick fill in your lips
3:43adding a bit more color to the center of your lips to give it that extra pop
3:50and now your sultry bridal look is complete whether you're more of a
3:54glamorous or soldier bride
3:56I wish you all the best of look on one of the most important and beautiful
3:59moments in your life
4:01good luck
4:16if
0:00becoming a bride is one of the most special days in a woman's life
0:04it's a day where your life is forever joined with another and it's a magical
0:08moment that you will always remember
0:13wedding season is upon us so it's a perfect time to show how to get a
0:17natural makeup look for your wedding day
0:19first find a foundation or BB cream that is as close to your natural skin tone as
0:24possible and then use your fingers to apply the product all of your face and
0:28with my new favorite rolling sponge
0:30I'm going to blend out this product I know it looks like I'm paint rolling on
0:34my face but it really works
0:36the next step is perhaps the most important step concealer when choosing a
0:41concealer try and find a shape that's two shades lighter than your foundation
0:44many brides don't get a lot of sleep leading up to the wedding so concealer
0:48is key
0:49unless you have a zombie themed wedding try and find a concealer that has a good
0:53coverage and now just finish off the face with loose translucent powder to
0:57modify the skin
1:00you
1:00because this is a very natural look i'm filling in my brows with the matching
1:04color to give my browser more polished and clean look
1:10and from my eyeliner i'm just going to use a dark brown eyeshadow color and
1:14lightly
1:15I'm going to line my upper lid next step illuminate the eyes
1:19what I'm going to do here is I'm going to highlight the inner corners of my
1:21eyes first and then the center of my lids and of course my brow bone to
1:26brighten up the ice
1:30to give my eyes a bit more definition I'm going to align it with the dark
1:34brown pencil I would try to avoid a black eyeliner because it can look a bit
1:38too harsh and now just curl your lashes and apply generous coats of mascara
1:50every bride has a glow on her wedding day whether its natural or makeup
1:54i'm going to show you how to get that beautiful bridal glow take a rose
1:58colored blush and added to the apples of your cheeks and then sweep it up the
2:02cheekbones for soft rosy glow
2:04then just take a light pink cheek stain to highlight your cheekbones for a
2:07luminous effect
2:11for a hint of color of my lips I'm taking a lip pencil and lining and
2:15filling in my licks
2:23as little girls we dream of what our wedding they will look like and then
2:27suddenly that magical day actually happens for all of the upcoming
2:31brides-to-be I wish you the utmost join your wedding day

0:12this is an extremely easy makeup tutorial all you need is a green
0:15eyeliner or eyeshadow load up the color on your eyeliner brush and start lining
0:21your eyes bring can be a hard color to pull off so if you want a foolproof
0:24green color look for one that has a yellow undertone if you want to make the
0:29color green pop out more use a pearl lemon color along the inner corners of
0:32your eyes to brighten them up just a bit
0:34the colors lemon and green goes so well together because it's such a refreshing
0:38combo try to work in a bright blue color to bring in more of a teal color along
0:42the outer line easy step here just curl lashes and apply mascara
0:50and that's it for ice keep it light and simple for the lips select a hot pink
0:55lip color and Papas right along the center of your lips for that pop of
0:59color
1:02now take your shimmering highlighter and pack this along your cheekbones to
1:08create an illusion of doing skin
1:19and add just a little bit on your Cupid's bow in the center of your bottom
1:23lip so it's not so flat looking
1:34as you guys know I just moved to New York and I've been working like crazy
1:37i'm sure a lot of you guys are cramming for finals are finishing up on some
1:41projects and deadlines and whatnot so use a little bit of concealer if you
1:45have extra dark circles like myself use your ring finger because it's the most
1:49delicate finger for your delicate under eyes now take your loose powder and set
1:53your feet for the flash i recommend using a peach color peach looks great
1:59with green so loaded up on your blush brush and add this color to your cheeks

2:14face is done let's move onto spring fashion i'm gonna give you guys some
2:18tips to change up your wardrobe to match the season

2:37fabric that never fails to make anyone look anything less than pretty metallics
2:42are reserved just for night you can rock your metallics at any time during the

3:39such a lady like fabric that will instantly femme up any of your look and

4:04good luck everyone and have a wonderful weekend and happy International Women's
4:08Day
0:00this tutorial today is inspired by the movie broken city where Catherine
0:08zeta-jones stars as the elegant wife of the New York Mayor start out their faces
0:18as usual and move right into priming the face i have here printing with the stars
0:23from benefit
0:24it's a kit filled with some benefits top picks
0:31using their eye shadow primer i'm going to . my entire eyes like this so that
0:35the primer is evenly distributed
0:42and with the delicate ring finger blend away
0:49timer not only helps with eyeshadow but it also helps with concealer
0:53so take your concealer the 1 i'm using here is from the benefit hit conceal
0:57your dark circles and eyelids and blend away with your ring finger
1:06and now the concealer is not going to smudge or settle into fine lines and
1:11once you're done just dab your eyes with loose powder
1:13this will actually help your makeup last longer and then let's move on to eye
1:17makeup for the I make apart i'm going to be using Lorax eyeshadow palette and for
1:23this tutorial I'm only going to be using my clean fingers to apply my eye shadow
1:28if you don't have any brushes or you forgot them on your trip
1:31no worries just make sure your fingers are clean and starting with your ring
1:34finger tap the base color on your lids gently dab it on like this
1:39pretty easy
1:42usually you want to use a smaller brush for the darkest color in this case we
1:46have our pinky finger the pinky finger will give you better control unlike the
1:51rest of the fingers with your pinky finger apply the darkest color along the
1:55outer corners of your eyes like this with the middle finger this should act
1:59like the fluffy brush blend everything together
2:01try not to mix up the fingers or else your eye makeup might end up looking
2:05muddy
2:10yeah
2:14whatever is left on your pinky finger apply this along the lower lash line to
2:18balance out your eyes
2:25for the highlighter let's use the index finger and apply this color along the
2:29brow bone and center of the lid to add more dimension to your eyes
2:36now let's take a bronze eyeliner or eyeshadow and add this along the inner
2:40corners
2:41usually if you want your eyes to have more of a doll like look use highlighter
2:45but if you want a more mature look a darker color along the inner corners
2:49like this using your black eyeliner line your eyes
2:52what i'm doing here is building up my line by making tiny little strokes
2:56filling in any empty spaces until I have one solid line
3:15time to curl the lashes and get them ready for mascara
3:22i'm going to be using to face better than false lashes mascara here at the
3:26lash extension system where you prime the iceberg build up the lashes and then
3:30seal everything in
3:34first step I'm going to wet my lashes with mascara
3:40and while the mascara is still wet and using their lash fiber one here i'm
3:45going to add a generous amount of their fiber onto my lashes
3:49this is going to help build up my lashes so that they're longer with more volume
3:52and now just steal everything in with the same mascara from step one
4:02not bad right it actually looks like i'm wearing fake lashes
4:06all right on to the next step browse her brows have a higher arch than my natural
4:10brows so I'm going to have to arched eyebrows a little higher than usual to
4:14recreate her brows
4:16finally we can move on to the face i am using here of foundation
4:20faker from the benefit apparently it's an oil-free cream to powder formula that
4:24perfects your complexion but it's not a foundation
4:27this is a really nice product but i only recommend it for those who have a good
4:31complexion because the coverage is pretty light
4:34if you need more coverage is better to use a foundation steal everything in
4:39with your powder
4:42and let's move on to the cheeks using tarts flesh
4:49I'm going to contour my face with this color applying it on the apples of my
4:52cheeks and brushing it out again
5:00intensify the contour by applying bronzer bronzer will give your face more
5:05dimension by creating shadow and whatever is left on your brush just add
5:08this along the sides of your forehead to create an illusion of a smaller forehead
5:17with an illuminator or highlighter at this on the tip of your eyeshadow brush
5:22and then start dabbing it along the highest points on your face your brow
5:26bone your cheekbones
5:28your skin will instantly look as if it's glowing giving you a healthy looking
5:32complexion
5:33since I'm kind of in a fancy mood i am going to use is Dolce & Gabbana bronzer
5:38scourges this is what the bronzer looks like honestly I didn't want to use it
5:42and I saved it just for this video so here goes
5:46as you can see the first application will be intense because of the black
5:50pigment from the leopard spots so make sure to really really blend
5:54after all the leopard spots are gone it's just going to be a normal bronzer
5:58for the lips i'm going to give them a mini spa by exfoliating all the flaky
6:02skin off
6:03this is the victoria's secret lip scrub scrub it's are made out of sugar so if
6:07you really want to make your own sugar lip scrub just add sugar to Vaseline and
6:11use that as a scrub instead
6:13wipe everything off with the tissue and your lips should be baby butt smooth
6:16apply lip balm as usual and get ready for lipstick finish off your lips with a
6:21beautiful warm nude lip color
6:35and now you're finished I love wearing bright colorful makeup looks but
6:39honestly I prefer simple natural looking makeup
6:43this is a very simple classy look that can be worn to work dinner in school so
6:48i hope you guys enjoyed this video
6:50good luck ha
6:55yeah

0:01nature is the best place to find beauty inspiration because its natural pure and
0:06simple for this new year
0:08I'm going to get back in touch with my basics and this is a great tutorial for
0:12all teens watching who are new to beauty
0:15welcome
0:17the first step to restarting your beauty routine is taking care of your skin if
0:22you want your skin to look at it has to feel good
0:25hydration is key and josie maran argan oil is currently my must-have for supple
0:30smooth skin
0:31Arjun oil provides incredible moisture retention because the oil contains
0:35eighty percent unsaturated fatty acid and is more stable in sunlight than any
0:40other antioxidants
0:41so it's perfect to wear during the daytime it has natural healing benefits
0:45for scars and can reduce skin inflammation
0:49because it has high levels of vitamin E it's an effective anti-aging oil next
0:55step skip foundation and try either a tinted moisturizer or BB cream
1:00contrary to popular belief BB cream was invented back in the nineteen fifties by
1:04German dermatologist
1:06it was made for patients who had recently undergone surgery
1:09the purpose of BB cream was to protect the skin all while providing a light
1:13coverage for the wear today BB cream is also known as blemish balm or beauty
1:18balm and is an all-in-one face product that contains added benefits like
1:22sunscreen
1:23Sarah moisturizer primer and foundation think of it as your one stop shop for
1:28the face if you're not a fan of foundation or if you're not allowed to
1:31wear foundation try BB cream instead let your parents know that it's a sunscreen
1:36and skin care product that slightly tinted after BB cream powder the face as
1:40usual or modify the face by using oil blotting sheets when it comes to makeup
1:45i recommend all teenagers to redefine the brows try not to over pluck your
1:49brows the fuller the better but try to reshape them nicely when it comes to the
1:53brows it's all about finding the right shape for your look and if i get a lot
1:57of thumbs up I'll create a video on how to reshape your brows four different
2:01looks
2:02for my everyday eyeliner look I like to keep it really simple
2:05I'm going to load up my soho angled brush with my black eyeliner and of
2:09course line my eyes
2:10the trick to keeping it as natural as possible is to stay within the lash line
2:14area gently feather the liner out so it fades away softly and let's move on to
2:19curling the lashes hear what I'm doing is conditioning my lashes using the our
2:29general for all your mascara lovers you know how brittle your lashes can feel
2:33just like the hair on your head it's kind of nice to give your lashes and
2:36deep conditioning love
2:38if you're consistently conditioning your lashes every day you'll notice that
2:41they'll grow longer and feel stronger after conditioning your lashes apply
2:46mascara as usual to make your eyes pop
2:49I'm going to keep my makeup really simple by just adding highlighter on my
2:55eyes and face using my blush paper here by my couture
2:59I'm just gonna fold it up so I can easily use it on my eyes
3:02dab it on like so and blend out with your fingers
3:06I'm gonna like a hundred you can add highlighter along the inner corners of
3:14your eyes to give them a radiant look
3:17in 10 chance
3:20I gotta take a break
3:22and just finish it all off on your cheek bones to give your skin that luminous
3:25glow
3:28you wanna know
3:30I admit I am the worst when it comes to moisturizing my body but this year I'm
3:34going to make it a habit to moisturize every day using here my pacifica tuscan
3:39blood orange body butter
3:41i am going to moisturize all the dry areas on my skin like elbows knees feet
3:46hands and pretty much the rest of my body because it's really dry
3:50let's try our best to avoid chalkboard arms and legs and moisturize every night
3:54and my sister here Christine is going to show you how she did her braids
3:58she told me that she learned how to braid hair from soccer practice
4:01by learning how to braid her team members here so i guess everyone was
4:04sitting in a circle and braiding each other's hair doesn't matter what future
4:11crazy dream to avoid flyaways and hair sticking all over the place
4:18take them down by hair spraying them down using my big sexy hair hairspray
4:23i'm going to set our hair in place and pat down the flyways
4:30here
4:32maybe and for the nails i'm going to use here my nail teeny polish provided by
4:38fc's January glam bag and with a toothpick or a needle coat your nail
4:43with the Polish and make sure it's really nice and wet and while it's still
4:47wet
4:47add a few dabs of green and layer them on top of each other
4:50quickly add a few drops of red and do this as fast as possible
4:55we need the polishes to be wet because the next step requires you to take the
4:58toothpick or needle and marble eyes the colors together like this
5:02you're basically going to strike the colors together with your dotting tool
5:07make cute little white dots repeat the same steps to all your nails and that's
5:11pretty much it

4:16mascara
4:21mmm
4:21so what i'm doing here is i'm coming up through my lashes
4:25it's actually not that bad but you kind of have to get used to it
4:42using my trusty armani master corrector concealer
4:47this is one of my favorite concealers i really recommend it
4:50I'm going to erase my dark circles and any blemishes and redness on my face
4:54because I like using a formula that's really easily blendable and it's
4:58foolproof
4:59now that my concealer is set i'm going to powder my face using L'Oreal True
5:03Match powder
5:10yeah
5:13I
5:15on to the next step
5:20blush here I'm using benefits famous lip and cheek satin stain
5:24i'm going to use just a little bit to add a beautiful flesh to my skin
5:29using a cheek stain is a great way to create the most realistic looking blush
5:34because it won't look so powdery and it won't have any word texture it's going
5:38to blend into the skin and we'll give you a really nice beautiful satin finish
5:43ok here's another interesting one and again is my benefit
5:49it's called fine one one and it's basically a new all-in-one chic and
5:55lifted having the highlighter section on the highest point of my cheeks what I'm
5:59gonna do is I'm gonna make a swiping motion like this and basically it just
6:02takes two swipes blend away and you're pretty much done
6:06i'm using my current favorite lip cream by NYX in dali girl
6:14it has a silky glossy finish add just a little bit on your lips to create this
6:19beautiful velvety finish
6:21I'm wearing all ever eaten jewelry here which is actually my own jewelry line I
6:26designed and this is from the new chapter to collection inspired by juliet
6:31from the romantic story Romeo and Juliet
6:34I star-crossed lover earrings it comes in three parts as you can see a gold
6:39half star that can be worn in front or behind the ear lobe and the backing of
6:43course and you also get a black diamond pave stone stud that can be worn alone
6:48or with the gold star
6:50here i have the dagger nail ring you can wear this on your middle index or ring
6:56finger
6:57personally i like to wear it on the middle finger and here is the glove of
7:01love handpiece that's definitely a statement piece
7:05I got to finish off the look with the crown of love head piece you can wear
7:09this in so many different ways and you'll instantly feel like a princess
7:12with this on
7:13so here's the finished no princess look it's a very soft romantic winter look my
7:19favorite part about this look has to be the eyebrows and cheeks
7:22I find that most people look more youthful with fuller looking brows and
7:26highlighter on the cheeks
7:28so if you're looking for a sweet innocent look this is a look for you
7:32Merry Christmas and of course they're black
7:38music by Mindy Gledhill hell
0:00I've been waiting to see the image you made such a terrible vengeance until a
0:07little drama you know the complicated doesn't appreciate the occasional twist
0:14mr. lon this look is inspired by the bond girl from the new Skyfall movie
0:24she has this dark family look that's perfect if you need a sensual holiday
0:28party look I can open up with my faux fur jacket because it's freezing out
0:33here
0:34start off with naked eyes and I'd like for you to meet matt from the bomb using
0:39their matte dark grey eyeshadow
0:40I'm going to fill in my brows so they're similar to sufferings
0:44sometimes i like to use pencil other times i like to use powder but in this
0:49case I want my brows to look really soft
0:51which is why I'm using powder next step using brow gel to set everything into
0:55place here im using shallow brow gel brow shells are great if your brows need
0:59more teaming it sets the hair in place so it doesn't stick around in different
1:03directions
1:04just one sweep of the brush is all you need with the same eyeshadow that you
1:08used on your brows start applying this on your eyes
1:10Pat it on like so and build up the color until you're happy with the intensity
1:17now with your angled brush start sharpening out the outer edge
1:24and do the same for the inner corners of the ice this will instantly give you
1:28vixen looking eyes
1:30now run the color along the lower lash line
1:33so the eyes are not too top-heavy this will balance out the eye makeup
1:37now with your blending brush softly blend the edges so it's not so harsh
1:43looking
1:50and once you're done take a black eyeliner the one I'm using here is by
1:53starlet line your eyes as usual
1:59winger your eyes just a bit and line your waterline to intensify this look
2:03more
2:04and take your brush to soften the eyeliner
2:12now you're ready for mascara
2:17carlashes
2:22using a volumizing mascara of your choice i'm using their real benefit
2:25apply generous coats of mascara and tell you happy
2:32yeah
2:34yeah
2:35and i'm going to use the bigger version of Matt to contour my face
2:40using a matte taupe color contour your nose
2:43this will add definition to your face
2:51the nail polishes that I used here is by nail teeny i recommend using a sparkling
2:55gold red or oxblood nail polish finish off the lips with the dark vampy glass
2:59here i'm using the daredevil color my moxie
3:07if you really want to pull off this look you want to try and keep your hair up
3:10and where the right outfit
3:11makeup is half the battle look for a lace dress and faux fur coat and this is
3:16the type of makeup - we're on our first tape
3:18it's kind of more if you want to catch someone's attention because it's
3:21beautifully bold good lack
0:00yeah
0:06yeah
0:35to get this beautiful hypnotic look have your face foundation ready and let's
0:43move straight into the eyes
0:44select a lilac eyeshadow color and apply this color on the outer corners of your
0:49eyes
0:49blend around this area and try to keep the rest of the eye area clean next step
0:55take a black sparkling color and sculpt this color on your crease and lower lash
0:59line
1:05with your blending brush blend everything out to create a subtle smokey
1:10effect
1:13load up your brush with the silver color and run this along the inner lower lash
1:18line
1:19this will help brighten up the eyes now take the silver glittering eye shadow
1:24color and with your finger
1:26just dab it on the center of your lids this will give your eyes a glamorous
1:30look
1:33and from here on up you can add more of the black eyeshadow to intensify your
1:38eyes
1:39just be sure to blend everything away you want this look to be extremely soft
1:43and hazy
1:44no hard edges with the smaller brush loaded up with a black eye shadow and
1:49line this on your waterline
1:50this will help give your eyes and edgy look
1:54and once you're done with the waterline just take your favorite black eyeliner
1:58here i'm using our liner and line your eyes
2:01I like to start with a thinner line and then taper out to exaggerate the shape
2:05of my eyes
2:06also don't forget to line your lower lash line halfway to balance out the
2:10shape of your eyes if you line it all the way it can sometimes make your eyes
2:14appear smaller
2:30yeah
3:11and now it's time for the lashes my lashes are not only thin but they grow
3:15straight down so i have to give him a lift
3:21when it comes to building up my lashes I prefer to use a two-step process where I
3:27use a mascara base to thicken and lengthen my lashes
3:31now that my lashes are nicely marinated with the CIL's booster
3:36I can now use my Hypnose star mascara this brush is really nice because one
3:41side is flat helping deposit a generous amount of product on my lashes
3:45while the other side is round which helps separate and lengthen my lashes
3:49this is going to give me a glossy finish so it's perfect for this look
3:59and now that my eyes are finished we can move on to the face
4:04since i'll be wearing a mask I'm going to contour my face first
4:09and then apply blush on my cheeks
4:12try not to add too much because it might overwhelm the face
4:18because we want more focus on the eyes just finish off with a light lip color
4:24tell me and now for the finishing touch
4:30yeah
4:36yeah
4:52yeah
4:54yeah
5:02yeah
5:12yeah
5:13yeah
5:24see
5:48good luck everyone
0:00got a casual date coming up no worries because i'm going to show you how to get
0:03the right makeup look
0:05nails what you're packing your bag and of course some fashion tips for your
0:08casual date night look at this thing and then was brewing
0:12let's start with a fresh face using the Marabella eyeshadow in semi formal
0:18it's a shimmery autumn brown color and using my soho smudger brush or use a
0:23dense dome shaped brush load up your brush with the brown color and apply
0:26this color on your legs and lower lash line then blend everything out
0:31applying a brown color all over your legs and lower lash line is a great way
0:35to help create a smoky look to your eyes
0:37taking a dark deep plum eye shadow line your lower and upper lash line with this
0:42color and then blend away
0:45remember try not to like the top part of your eyes
0:48we want the eyes to be a little bottom heavy for this casual look
0:53we don't want your eyes to look too bright we kind of want them to have
0:56almost like a sleepy look I know that sounds a little weird but honestly it's
1:00one of the few times and advocating a sleepy look next step
1:04carlashes some of you who don't need a corner lashes are so lucky my lashes
1:09grow straight down so i have two columns and then apply generous coats of mascara
1:15I like to do this trick where I take the mascara juan and hold it vertically and
1:20I give my lashes a few good swipes then afterwards I like to comb it through
1:24horizontally
1:26it really helps get more product on my lashes this trick is a great way to make
1:30it look like you're wearing eyeliner for the face
1:33finish it off with bronzer and blush personally i like to use bronzer first
1:38to sculpt and contour my face and then I like to use blush to add color
1:44and now we can finally move on to lips i'm going to use a bright pink lip gloss
1:48the one I'm using is by James cosmetic sparkle gloss and now that the makeup is
1:53done i'm finally going to show love to my hair my hair has been so dry so I'm
1:58going to use a split and repairing product called Carol's Daughter monoi
2:01repairing split end sealer
2:03it seals 93.3 percent of split ends by binding the separated ends of the hair
2:09keep in mind that trimming a hair is very crucial if you want it to be
2:12healthy
2:13however if you don't have time or you need that extra length for a special
2:17occasion
2:17this is a great product to use you can apply this product on wet or dry hair it
2:23will instantly feel nourished and now that my makeup is done
2:26it's finally time to dress up because my clothes are so simple just likings and a
2:32black oversized to it
2:33I decided to dress up my look by wearing this knee high boots
2:36it also helps toughen up the look my boots and bag are from justfab.com if
2:41you really like the boots and bag that I'm wearing here
2:44they're both for thirty nine dollars and ninety-five cents each on justfab.com
2:47when it comes to my bag
2:49it's important to pack my essentials I never leave the house without a
2:52concealer palette just case for touch-ups and of course a powder brush
2:56and press powder to keep my face shine free eyeliner both pencil and liquid for
3:01touch ups or if I want to intensify my eyes later on during the night
3:05lash curler to perk up my lashes during the night a smudger brush lip balm and
3:10of course my lip gloss
3:12I always make sure to carry water or drink in my bag
3:15it's really important to stay hydrated last but not least some restaurants will
3:20only accept cash
3:21so it's better to play it safe than sorry oh wait I forgot to show you my
3:24nail tutorial I'm keeping this look really simple and pretty
3:28using three of my favorite colors I'm going to make a few dots and with a
3:32brush soaked in nail polish remover dab it on the dot
3:35you'll notice right away that the nail polish remover is dissolving the drops
3:39of color
3:40keep having it around this will create a beautiful watercolor effect
3:45it's really important to apply top coat on top of your base color before adding
3:49the color drops or else the nail polish remover will dissolve your base color
3:53repeat the same steps to all your nails just have fun with it and when you're
3:57done just apply top coat and now your watercolor nails are finished and
4:02finally i'm ready to head out
4:04here's my outfit knee high boots are very in for autumn since the boots are
4:08so edgy with all the buckles
4:10I decided to pair it with my casual 10 bag to balance out the edginess of the
4:14boots
4:14ok now it's time to eat I give huge props to any restaurant with purse hooks
4:19I don't like having my back on the floor i recommend finding a sushi restaurant
4:22near university because they tend to be a little cheaper sushi restaurants are
4:27so fun because it requires you to share a menu with your date
4:31so you can talk and be really interactive with your date instead of
4:34just sitting there twiddling with your thumbs
4:36sushi is also very healthy you can eat a lot and not feel so bad
4:41and if you don't eat fish sushi restaurants usually carries chicken and
4:44vegetable tempura dishes
4:46this is actually how I break apart my chopsticks always breaks evenly and this
4:52is how I hold my chopsticks
4:54how do you guys hold your chopsticks do you hold it my way or his way
5:00salmon is my favorite fish and I love getting a spicy tuna handle
5:04what's your favorite thing to order the sushi restaurant to all the ladies out
5:07there if you can handle the bill
5:09do your thing but if you can
5:11trying to attempt to offering to help pay such a friendly gesture
5:15other than that just be yourself he should like you for you good luck and
5:19have fun on your date

0:10you first want to get some colorful nail polishes and with the spoon or mixing
0:14palette tape is the answer to life
0:17take your fingers because you want to protect them from the splatter here i'm
0:20going to show you how to create splatter nails and with extra virgin olive oil
0:27put them on the sides of her nails to protect them from the splatter will also
0:31help condition your cuticles
0:33clearly I need some of that we e
0:37well a cloud parts and a bundle face it's only
0:42take your nail polish remover or nail thinner
0:46I know most of you guys will have nail polish remover because i don't have no
0:49thinner
0:50you just need a few drops of nail polish and makes a tiny amount of nail polish
0:54remover in your mixing palette find a toothbrush with a hard bristle that
0:57you're not using or a brow brush and with your thumb like the brush
1:02did you see that now with different colors
1:05just have fun
1:12all it's really up to you in your comfort level
1:16you can stay clean with a few splatters or you can go super crazy like me and
1:23then working with you one that a gril know
1:28I was cold and you knew
1:32I'm basically doing layers and layers until well it looks like this mess
1:38yeah i know but if this is a little too much for you
1:43I have another nail trick that you can mess around with that's a little more
1:46subdued i like to call it drip nails so get your colors ready and with a regular
1:51pencil just make random slowly marks like this
1:54you want to keep making these worlds with different colors
2:01basically just keep the drip pattern keeps swirling everything around
2:05think like a marble does that even make sense
2:09it may appear really thick looking on your nails but don't worry because it's
2:13going to dry them who is me
2:15you have to
2:17that's my
2:18kiss
2:20you're hot despite
2:27dip the pencil into the white nail polish and give it one last swirl and
2:32that's it
2:33once it's completely dry just top code it and you're pretty much ready to go
2:38alright so now for the makeup start out with your naked face
2:42yes I said naked I'm starting off with skincare first now with skincare i'm
2:47using equal 0 cellular activator facial serum first
2:50you know what the same it's a long name is going to work so what I'm using here
2:53is a serum basically a sara is like a liquid specialist they basically address
2:58specific needs some can be for wrinkles firming age spots whitening
3:03hyperpigmentation scars
3:05whatever it is there's a serum for it the molecule in serums are much smaller
3:09than the moisturizers molecule which means you want to use it right away
3:13because it will penetrate deeper and deliver all the goodness into your skin
3:17and don't forget to apply your moisturizer after sarren because you
3:20want to hydrate your skin even if you have oily skin
3:23you still have to use a moisturizer try using an oil free formula instead
3:28fun fact about this Brandi close it's actually a plant-based skincare line and
3:32their ceremony boys riser here has stem cells
3:35plant stem cells to be exact I wouldn't put human stem cells on my face
3:41all right moving on to sunscreen
3:44you're going to need at least SPF 15 so show your skin some love and protect it
3:50next step a little bit of foundation use it to even out your skin tone
3:56I know you guys keep hearing these sailors but I'm a huge believer that
4:00less is more
4:01far beyond the mismatch of person
4:05ah and using a sponge will help blend your foundation giving you that flawless
4:10airbrushed look please any next step using mineral powder again
4:18so when I was in Australia a really sweet subscriber name in gave me this
4:23amazing miracle in a red tube called luca's papa
4:27did I say that right guys anyways I love this stuff
4:30it's amazing you know what time it is everyone its brow time
4:35get in there and groom your brows nicely shaped browse will give your face more
4:39balanced
4:40this is bound to get messy but I don't care
4:45all right ladies you want to invest in a good neutral eyeshadow palette because
4:49the color taupe will go a long way using a brush or a sponge applicator apply
4:55this foolproof color as close to the lash line as possible and then the lower
4:59lash line
5:00taupe is a great contour shade it helps bring more dimension to your eyes and
5:05now it's time for the pretty eye shadow color using salty cosmetics loose
5:08eyeshadow powder in glamazon would focus around the inner corners of the eyes
5:13first
5:14it should be concentrated here and then blend out just a bit
5:19yeah
5:22the top was gonna need a little bit of that glamazon way to you see how subtle
5:26this makeup is it just comes to show you that you don't always need crazy colors
5:30to make a statement
5:33and whatever is left over on your brush or sponge brush it on your brow bone
5:38depending on your comfort level use a liquid liner to line your eyes
5:42the reason why I'm such a huge fan of liquid liners is because they tend to
5:46last longer
5:47that's what you're going to need for a long school day so line your eyes and
5:50draw another line to create fake lashes like this
5:53now it's time to curl your lashes and apply your favorite mascara you want to
5:58use waterproof mascara if your eyelids are oily or if you live in a really
6:02humid climate
6:06and cut the lower lash line ever using a waterproof formula
6:12me all right I sure does and now it's time for blush I'm using this creamy
6:18blush i bought at target
6:19apply a paint brush color around the apples of your cheeks
6:22usually when I wake up I look super pale so i need to add a little bit of life
6:27back into my face blush is the answer
6:32yeah
6:35and here i have to meet her roll on perfume oil so you're probably wondering
6:39what's your perfume oil perfume oils are the scented ingredient that gives
6:43regular perfumes colognes soaps shampoos Kendall's their smell perfume oil has
6:48you know alcohol so won't irritate the skin it will last longer because the
6:52alcohol can dilute the scent of the perfume you want to apply this on your
6:56wrist behind your ear and neck area
6:59mmm i love smelling good ok i'm almost done but I need your help i need you
7:04guys to help me pick a lip gloss color to finish off this look which one should
7:08I choose first one second one third one

0:12perfect for four states interviews weddings
0:14that is if you're living in an enemy world get your headphones ready because
0:18this look
0:19might take a while to recreate i'm going to start out with my poor reducing
0:22primer and apply this on any wrinkly poorest area on your face
0:27this is going to smooth out any of your fine lines and fill in your pores to
0:30create a smooth canvas to work on with the liquid foundation that's a few
0:34shades lighter than your own skin color . the foundation all over your face
0:38yep keep going more a little mark stop here and a little here
0:46how do you think that looks good now let's . a few more haha just kidding
0:52yeah

1:02tools that's great for blending and creating stuff looks
1:08with your favorite concealer to conceal any blemishes dark circles
1:14watching us anime girls have perfect skin and since no one really has perfect
1:19skin
1:19unless your baby you want to pack that concealer on your place with your powder
1:26set your makeup by powdering the foundation and concealer
1:33yeah
1:34powder helps set any texture that's moisture wet
1:38that's not dirty
1:48all right time for eyeshadow yes
1:51my favorite part using a luminous eyeshadow dab this all over your crease
1:56area aluminous eyeshadow adds color to your eyes without making it look like
2:01you're wearing eye shadow
2:05and with a copper color apply this shade on your crease and follow the natural
2:09contour on your eyes
2:11notice how this creates dimension to the eyes we all know your eyes already have
2:15dimension but with makeup or exaggerating it using a matte taupe
2:20color keep intensifying the contour of your eyes until you've reached that
2:24level of definition that you're satisfied with
2:27ok and now it's time to draw on your eyes if you're good at drawing anime or
2:34manga
2:35this will be easy peasy using a creamy black pencil eyeliner make sure it's
2:40creamy because we don't want the pencil to drag on your eyes right above your
2:44crease start drawing the outline of your anime I shape it should look like this
2:49a cat eye shape but way above the crease line
2:55take your matte black eyeshadow and start coloring in if you're good at
3:03coloring inside the lines as a child
3:05this should be no problem for you
3:10start sketching out anime lower lashes should be chunky and pointing
3:17and don't forget the upper lashes
3:20they should be skinny and pointing there are hundreds of different enemy I shapes
3:24that you can use if you need to use reference photos of anime or manga to
3:29help you find the one that fits your eye shape best
3:40hey don't play with the makeup take a bright color choice i decided to use a
3:44vivid purple color for this one
3:46apply the bright color along the upper and lower lash line of the eyes and
3:51softly blend it
3:52leave the middle part empty because if you fill it in it might look a little
3:56too dark and gothic
4:08with a champagne color dab a bit of this highlighter along the lower lash line to
4:15brighten up the eyes for this look it's all about making the eyes look bigger
4:20next step
4:23curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for mascara using your favorite
4:27mascara like my matches the color of my eyeshadow apply generous coats on your
4:32lashes keep building up your lashes you want sky-high lashes
4:37and if you still need help finish off the eyes with fake lashes break your
4:42lashes in so they're not too stiff
4:44kind of like breaking into your new jeans you know what to do apply glue and
4:47stick them on
4:53we're not done yet with your brow pencil failing your browser like you normally
4:59do
5:02but before you finish take an eyeliner pencil in the similar shape to your
5:09bright eyeshadow color my hair is purple and fill in your brows colored browse
5:14intensify the colors of your eye shadow
5:22with the matte bronzer or a matte taupe eyeshadow concert the sides of your nose
5:31this will make your nose look more skinny using a matte white eyeshadow
5:36apply this as highlighter and apply along the bridge of my nose to create an
5:41illusion of a taller knows
5:44also apply this on the high point of your cheeks to bring out your cheekbones
6:01and with the bronzer you all know the deal
6:04contour your cheeks and add more definition to the face
6:09yeah
6:13and apply natural looking blush to add softness back into your face
6:27for the lips i'm going to use a nude lip liner because I'm going to make my lips
6:31look smaller by reducing the size of my lips
6:34I'm going to do this by erasing the edges of my lips the more you erase the
6:38outline of your lips
6:39the smaller your lips look your new lip pencil should be as close to your skin
6:43color as possible
6:46blend the pencil until you don't see any marks
6:51afterwards take a pink lips take and with a brush
6:55load it up and add the color on the center of your lips
6:58you want your lips to look softer and delicate because enemy lips are usually
7:02just a thin line
7:03you don't want the edges of your lips to appear too sharp keep in mind that the
7:07smaller and delicate your lips look the larger your eyes will look and if you
7:12really want your eyes look bigger
7:13pop on your enemy eyeballs also known as circle lens
7:18I been an aide you need that we were done with brush em last step
