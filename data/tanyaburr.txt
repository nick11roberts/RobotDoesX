0:00hey guys today I'm going to be doing one of my most requested makeup looks and
0:03it's mila kunis now she is just so gorgeous
0:07when I was googling pictures of her to kind of prepare for doing this look I
0:10just thought wow your makeup is beautiful so I'm really looking forward
0:13to filming this
0:14ok so for foundation I'm going to use your skin forever and i'm going to try
0:18and turn out my skin a little bit because my skin is a lot fairer than me
0:21the penises I need to kind of get that all if you look going on as best I can
0:25i'm also using this foundation because it has a very perfect matte finish which
0:28is how Miller was her skin which is doing a red carpet event
0:32i'm using my expert face brush from Real Techniques i'm just going a little
0:36circles all over my skin this foundation smells really good
0:40well it's not like cucumber know if you re creating a celebrity look like I am
0:47and changing the color of your skin a little bit more to dramatically
0:51I'm not going to have exactly the same skin tells me that he is all of a sudden
0:53I look like I've been in the Bahamas for a month but if you change your even a
1:00little bit you just need to make sure that you're blending it down ack sorry
1:03if I keep looking down just in the flip screen
1:06ok so I'm going to come back and properly perfect my skin and powder it
1:09later on once you've done the eyes in case any kind of eye shadow drops down
1:12and then it's just completely around my skin makeup so I'm going to get on and
1:16do the eyebrows and this is Mac chocolate brown and i'm just going to
1:20use it to fill in my brows
1:21now I mean if you start to make up pretty much exactly how i like to do you
1:24mind when i go out which is a nice strong brow strong smoky eye and a nude
1:29lip
1:29it's just so pretty and so wearable and I know that you guys are going to get so
1:33much wear out of this look so i can see why you've been requesting it for ages
1:37i'm just using a mac 26 expression just really gently stroking this through my
1:44brows
1:45if you don't like your brows this strong and pick a color like map Omega and you
1:49can still make the look absolutely gorgeous
1:52some kind of just going with the shape of my brows by adding in a little bit
1:55more of an arch which is just here
2:00I shadow i'm going to use my urban decay naked palette because it just has the
2:03perfect mila kunis eyeshadow colors in it
2:06like seriously just looks like mila kunis that pallet looks just like a i'm
2:11going to start of fries and toast
2:13which is this color here and a mac 217 brush and this is just going to kind of
2:18all over the lid up to the crease
2:21apart from this area here because I'm gonna put lighter shimmery colors in the
2:25inner corners
2:25next I'm taking hustle on a mac 239 brush to make it nice and smoky and dark
2:33so pack the eyeshadow onto the brush and then just push this along the lash line
2:40and stop when you get to come to the center of the lid and then pull it up
2:48and then take your 217 brush again and just blend that and now we're going to
2:53add some more
2:54she was having that same color again and then blending it now I'm going for the
2:59sparkly black which is called creep
3:01so I've just put that kind of over the top of the other color and then I'm just
3:08going to blend it the colors will all blend together and don't worry doc two
3:13black ones that blended in
3:15once you're blending brush gets to Daddy pick up a clean one because otherwise
3:18your eye shadow will start look really messy
3:20just like to wash if you like to do smokey eye makeup so I'd really
3:24recommend investing into blending brushes because it makes a huge
3:28difference to the eye shadow looks now just mix together on my brush hustle and
3:32creep
3:33so the dark brown and the black I'm just going to add a little bit one now
3:44starting to look really smoky and gorgeous now so I'm just going to get
3:47the other eye to the same stage then we'll be back with you but he starts
3:49most of the smokiness on top of the lid down but media often has heard of up
3:54here through her crease a bit of a more golden brown so i'm going to use dark
3:58horse which is this color here
4:00add a touch of that through the crease just in the outer corner and then I'm
4:07just going to blend that very top line with eyeshadow stops so that it looks
4:12very nice and smoky and soft now add some light to the eyes are going to use
4:19thin
4:19I'm going to bring this just through the inner corner and then going to take half
4:23baked which is a bright gold
4:25on a little brush add that on top
4:30let's be honest with you guys you don't need to put it underneath i just put it
4:33on and then thought that doesn't break it said so I spent half baked on top so
4:37you can just go straight on with half baked
4:40maybe use a tiny bit of sin right in the inner corners but on this part here
4:45half-baked looks better on the same little brush I'm going to take a tiny
4:49bit of half-baked just underneath the eyes
4:52me too often wears a lot of bright gold color just under the first part of iron
5:00it really opens the eyes up such a pretty effect and then going back to my
5:05t 39 brush which has all the black and dark brown on it and I'm going to put
5:08that underneath the eye and make sure you really blend that out on the rise to
5:18on a clean 239 brush and just going to use a tiny bit of virgin which is this
5:22one here really light color and this is just going to highlight the brow bone
5:26again immunity is always has black eyeliner all the way around her eyes so
5:32I'm going to use my Rimmel scandaleyes what proof cold gel in black this just
5:37does not budget so good
5:46okay i'm going to cut my eyelashes he's in my shirt more relaxed colors
5:53i'm going to put on lots of my maybe in the falsies mascara
6:00I'm not going to use false eyelashes because mila kunis sometimes she was and
6:03so no she doesn't but she never goes for a full on false eyelash look it's always
6:08just kind of like nice fluttery eyelashes and I think that I can achieve
6:11that with just mascara
6:12if you feel like you need to apply some natural false ones then d
6:15did i say i'm using my maybelline the falsies mascara if I didn't that's why
6:19I'm using
6:28finally that's the eyes done so i'm not going to conceal using my Mac concealer
6:32the studio finish in the color and w 20
6:39ok now to attempt to get me because his cheekbones i'm going to use my Clarence
6:43bronzer in the color 02 and just a blush blush bronzer brush whatever you like to
6:49call it
6:49I'm going to suck in my cheekbones and just fill in kind of the whole that
6:54comes when I soaked them like that
7:03so that is contouring my cheekbones and then I'm just going to apply was left on
7:11the brush just all over my face to get a slightly more bronze look because as I
7:17said before me the skin as much talk of the mine and then going to powder my
7:20skin using the rim or match perfection powder i've been loving this recently
7:23for blushing he is not warm soul because she always goes for this kind of
7:31beautiful bronzy look rather then pink or peach or anything
7:36and then the lips are going to use revlon lipstick and blush which is a
7:43brilliant kind of everyday lip color but also a color that lots of celebrities
7:47including military knows we're on the red carpet

0:00hey guys this is a I want to film an Arab inspired makeup look because i
0:03think that these makeup looks are amazing if you want to do something
0:06really different for a night out or a special dinner
0:11it's definitely an evening makeup look it's very kind of heavy on the eyes and
0:15tends to be a more community on the lips today I want to do and perfectly one so
0:21i'm going to start a foundation and i'm going to use reference color state and
0:24sand beige I really like this foundation and I don't have any faith in town at
0:28the moment and this is one of the only kind of pale foundation zone so that's
0:33why I'm using this today so i'll just pop some of that into the back of my
0:36hand and I'm going to use my Bobby Brown was called and face blender this is my
0:40favorite foundation brush at the moment I put it in my monthly favorites video
0:44and if you haven't watched 484 favorites ya go and watch it i'll link it down in
0:48the description box
0:49no this is a good color for me sorry I was just checking the colors AK and just
0:55going to blend this is a blend it
0:58I got some kind of buffing it all over my skin but I don't put too much on the
1:03brush to begin with even though i put quite a and love foundation of my hand
1:08lump I feel like to call it and I just take a small amount of that stuff onto
1:15my skin and as i said in my April favorites video this foundation brush
1:19just makes your foundation look beautiful
1:22it seems to put on just the right amount of foundation and it just makes us cool
1:29so flawless but gotta know if you guys can see it's starting to look rather
1:34nice and quite natural as well so what you like
1:37ok now it's time to your eyebrows now because this is an Arab inspired makeup
1:42look I want to do the browse quite strong tends to be a very strong shape
1:47and quite dark
1:49I like to start off with a lighter pencil this is lingering from Mac that's
1:54not too too dark and then i can make them darker
1:58with some eyeshadow internet but if I go straight home with the dark eyeshadow
2:02sometimes it can look a bit too much
2:06I'm just going to softly building up the shape making a little bit thicker so on
2:12this top line here it should be a straight line always go up to a point
2:16and then from that point you want to come down
2:21ok so now i have the shape of the browser and i'm going to take mystery
2:24eyeshadow which the dark matte brown for mac and an angled brush this is a mac
2:31266 brush and I'm just going to do
2:34really feather reconstr oaks throughout the whole brow so doing it this way I
2:41then haven't got a block of mystery eyeshadow on both eyes eyes eyebrows and
2:46it just looks slightly more natural
2:49the eyes you want to start with a creamy eye shadows a base i'm going to use by
2:53Terry shadow stick in the color misty rock then I'm just going to blend that
3:01with my finger
3:03I'm going to put this underneath the eyes as well next I'm going to go in
3:08with tracks
3:09I showed format which is this one here
3:12it's like a meted purple with gold flecks of shimmer annette and i'm just
3:22using a mac 217 brush just about that will leave my lid
3:25I'm just going to take a bit of tracks underneath my eyes as well and this will
3:34give us a really smoky effect next legislative Black Tide for Mac this is a
3:40military black eyeshadow but any location I will do for this debt and my
3:44angled brush i'm just going to put this really close to my lashline next
3:51Sunday's take some quarry eyeshadow which is a matte like meted path we can
3:56I like grayish purple and i'm going to use the zoeva petite crease brush I
4:02really love this
4:03forget increased effort
4:05action as i get the outer corners i'm just going to wing it out slightly and
4:09up towards the brown
4:12so just going through the crease right the way in and out and then flicking up
4:17slightly
4:18now I want to add a bit more of an intense purple so I'm going to take
4:21nocturnal eyeshadow all there is no time I shadow from mac and an angled brush
4:27and just woke up at the quarry eyeshadow
4:30I'm just going to run this through
4:35so if you're looking up with the edge then using the brush that I used to put
4:40Cory through the crease i'm just going to blend that in so i'm not doing a real
4:45kind of cut crease look it's just going to be a subtle kind of version of that
4:50it's time for line and our makeup look would not be complete with liquid liner
4:55that goes right the way into in lip
4:59don't say that by the way into the inner tear duct area like down here and then
5:04clicking all the way out as well
5:06my favorite designer the moment the Loreal superliner I thought the one that
5:10is called black black I'm starting the inner corner
5:14however if you can see that I've bought it right the way down into the corner
5:23if I keep looking down guys because I don't want the eyeliner to print up onto
5:30the eyeshadow just got that line is close to your lash line as possible and
5:35then with your eye open and looking straight ahead into a mirror you want to
5:39put up your wing line and
5:47it's just follow the line up these are my bottom lash line as a guide so as if
5:50my gosh time just carried on and then I just look down and bring join that line
5:58up with the lash line
6:00the reason why i plot out the way with my eye open is because if you do it with
6:04your eyes closed
6:05so now you can open it and then they will be one piece it's always best to do
6:08that with your eye open and then just once you've done the line you can look
6:13down to do you want the infant in
6:17ok so again I'm looking down guys because they don't have much my eyeliner
6:20the classic line a mistake has happened
6:23I've made this one thicker than this one so now i'm just going to make this one a
6:26bit thicker to match up with this one
6:28now he's put some eyeliner on my waterline have chosen to use macs
6:39eyeliner in design a power port it's a beautiful really vibrant purple glitter
6:44eyeliner so I'm going along the waterline with this and then i'm going
6:50to join up and meet their liner in their inner corners just going to add lots of
7:00my maybelline the falsies mascara on my top and bottom lashes
7:12and then going to apply the millie mackintosh so luxurious
7:15it's just pot some glue along the vein of the lash you want to wait for it to
7:21go tacky before you try to apply if you put the glue on and just try and put it
7:24on straight away the glue just will be too wet and it will slide around all of
7:29your i am driving me crazy so I like to just make sure it's a little bit tacky
7:35just going to walk around only for about a minute
7:39maximum or it will be too dry
7:43then I take some tweezers and just grab the lash in the middle and then I just
7:48place it down on top of my natural lashes as close to the lash lines or can
7:52I squeeze in one and first
8:02no just place the other end down use my little finger to kind of hold it down
8:05there until it stopped and that's how I apply lashes and that is the ice
8:10dunno just come in place that you can see them the glue if you can see a
8:14little white bits of clear that will dry clear
8:17so don't worry about that you can see that i'm going to use my collection
8:20lasting perfection concealer in number one fair and then actually is a fluffy
8:24eyeshadow brush to blend this in because i find it just blends in the masses
8:29it's kind of similar to their foundation brush lightly used as well
8:33it's really good for blending under the eyes
8:36now you just need to set your foundation concealer with some powder you can use
8:41any part of your life on Katie's that you're loose powder just because I got
8:45this recently i really want to use in the tutorial so gorgeous and then she's
8:54my Karen's bonds are just to contour my cheekbones and bronze up my skin a
8:58little bit
8:59I just mix the two colors together and it makes a really nice color for me
9:03just bringing this up my temples as well across took my forehead as well because
9:09this just makes your face shape look really lovely
9:11then instead of blush i'm just going to use my mac mineralize skinfinish in
9:15redhead this is an old one
9:16had four years to you can use any kind of mac mineralize skinfinish border or
9:20any kind of shimmery highlighter because i think that blush would just be too
9:24much with this look
9:25so just a bit of this across the top of the cheeks and apples of the cheeks just
9:30makes your skin look so glowy and beautiful and finally for the lips I'm
9:34going to Chanel which cover your shine in the color satisfaction
9:38I am just obsessed with this lipstick at the moment my favorite color
9:42I just think this is the most perfect nude lipstick for me ever
9:49then I'm just going to add a bit of my lip gloss the time your ballot gloss in
9:52the color chic and this is also my favorite nude thing at the moment
9:57they're my favorite nude lipstick is this my favorite nude lip gloss is this
10:01I do have paid the ones in my collection might just peachy and afternoon tea and
10:06but i actually prefer a slightly less pale need because I just think it looks
10:11really beautiful and I'm just obsessed with this lipgloss at the moment you
10:19kind of matches the lipstick perfectly so I'm not adding too much because it
10:25might be majorly glossy just to have a slightly slightly closer to finish and
10:31this is the finished look I really just kind of made up as I went along and use
10:35the Arabic makeup as an inspiration and I just really love how it turned out I
10:40need to make some kind of fancy dinner plans with Jim now because this makeup
10:43look is just too good to waste so I'm definitely going out tonight
10:46if you guys end up creating this makeup look for a night out or something i
10:50would ask that you love to see how you get on

0:00hey everyone today I'm going to film a really highly requested video which is a
0:04lily collins makeup tutorial now I can't believe I've never filmed this video
0:08before because I love her makeup looks so much
0:11she's so gorgeous and she's such a lovely gardens while i was lucky enough
0:14to meet her recently at was at the a long common party and she was so sweet
0:21and she took a photo of me for my blog and yeah she's just such a gorgeous
0:25going to make up is just blurs so just when we treat the makeup that i'm going
0:29to be recreating is when she always has beautiful pale skin really dark to find
0:34eyebrows and kind of red glossy lips and and just beautiful flush with eyelashes
0:40that look I'm going to take just type my hair behind what is out of the way I'm
0:44going to start by using the reference colorstay foundation in the color 150
0:47this is sean wha
0:50I just love this foundation the moment it goes through skin so well and
0:54although i am loving my Armani luminous silk foundations well i only have that
0:58in a tab come over i kind of want to get it in the pail as well and at the moment
1:02I have no fake thailand's it's the perfect time to be filming a little
1:05make-up stroke by the way I'm just trying to get some of my brush i'm just
1:09going to buff this into my skin using a believer defined buffer brush I've
1:16already moisturize my skin and use an eye cream so it's prepped with well for
1:20the makeup if you have extra early skill you find your foundation just as last on
1:25you then you could use a primer before the foundation as well I find this
1:29foundation just lost their well I don't need a primer but one of my favorites
1:33and benefit Porefessional i think is called it just makes your skin for
1:37always made me to makeup last longer
1:39now obviously are going to film all of this will this video be like 20 minutes
1:43long but I like to spend a lot of time just working the foundation to my skin
1:47so it looks like my skin just looking really good rather than a layer of
1:52foundation so i'll just keep on puffing away like this until it looks really
1:58perfect
1:59ok now it's time series really thick and strong dark eyebrows i am just a huge
2:05fan of this eyebrow neck you might look at it and be like oh that looks like
2:09everyone knew I hate it but just remember that i re-created Lily Collins
2:13looks so that's what I'm doing my eyebrows . i'm going to use a little
2:16angled brush and mystery eyeshadow from Mac I find when trying to make my brows
2:21a lot bigger than a powder just looks more natural than a pencil
2:24I'm just going to start by following the natural shape my brow reject their don't
2:29have much powder on my brush when it comes to the top part of my eyebrow i'm
2:34just going to go a bit higher the Maxwell brow like that so I got as you
2:40have made it a lot thicker I think it's one actually to make the broth thicker
2:44on the top of that underneath and also it's more flattering as well I'm not
2:49going to high up with the arch because Lily's browser actually quite straight
2:53always want to finish the last clean . i'm just going to see the other one and
3:02then we'll be right back with you but I show that I'm going to use my oven k
3:05naked palette I know use this and like all watching tutorials but it's just so
3:08handy and i'm going to start with the color sin which is this light shimmery
3:12color they're here funny noise my tummy is making the way this rumbling noises
3:17today I don't know why because i have hot breakfast then an angle brush i'm
3:26just going to take the dark horse which is a dark brown to move around club just
3:31going to add a tiny bit right at the lash line for a really natural
3:38definition at least she just looks like my lash line is really thick
3:41next I'm going to contour using buck which is a matte but medium turned brown
3:46color and i'm just going to blend this through the crease of my you always want
3:51to use a matte color when your contouring guys because the idea is that
3:54we're creating a shadow here to get the armoire definition and just keep
4:00blending blending this eyeshadow blending his key guys it just makes a
4:03shadow look amazing
4:07next I'm going to take my mom calm art line now and do the finest line of
4:11eyeliner next I'm just going to use my maybelline the falsies mascara and I'm
4:20not curling my eyelashes
4:21fast because I'm going to be applying some false eyelashes and I just find
4:25them easier to apply when I haven't called mine now it's time for lashes and
4:30i'm going to use the knowledge powerfully the lashes i just love these
4:33because it's not like they don't look like a strip lash because the lashes are
4:38all different lengths that looks more natural and pretty
4:42I'm just popping some theory along the vein of the lash and then I'm just going
4:46to place the lash down as close to my natural lash line as possible and i just
4:54use a combination of my fingers and the tweezers to push it down everything
5:00that's how about my lashes on so it's really really easy and if it starts
5:04going to pick up then just hold your finger down now for a bit longer then
5:09when you lift off should be stuck then i'm just going to use my collection
5:13lasting perfection concealer in number one fair this is the lightest when they
5:17do i love this concealer because the last four days if you have any spots and
5:22blemishes you don't have to worry about touching up and it's just such a lovely
5:27concealer and it doesn't make you break out either i'm just going to drop that
5:31around my nose when i get some redness and then just bending under my eyes to
5:37cover my dark circles beneath bottom lashes mascara i like to use the bottom
5:42lashes mascara because it doesn't smudge and it has a tiny little brush which
5:47helps me really get in now with the little bottom lashes also has put my
5:52memory upto hi I'm going to set my foundation using my second lorry one

7:43guys
0:00hey guys today I'm interested in a makeup tutorial because obviously i have
0:03no makeup on and i'm really excited about doing this look because i love it
0:07and wearing a lot recently and it's just a beautiful evening makeup is perfect
0:11for a date night or night a lot of friends and just anything where you want
0:16to go make up really nicely for the evening i guess because it really feels
0:19like an evening look
0:20I think I'm just gonna get my hair out of the way I'm going to start by using
0:24my l'oreal true match foundation because I've been really like mistake videos in
0:29my last tutorial and I just thinks a nice foundation which is close to the
0:33foundation on the back of my hand and I'm using my Real Techniques bold metals
0:37brush in the number one hundred and i really like this Russian foundation so
0:42tend to just kind of adapt on what was
0:46oh no they're just have to build your work outside
0:49I really like you can't hit that and that anyway yeah i'm just going to pop
0:53this all over my skin and if I keep looking for here it's because i'm using
0:57my viewfinder as a mirror
1:00I just love this brush foundation because it's kind of similar to my bobby
1:03brown and bubbly Brown called the baby's face blender but as you know if you want
1:09you two girls before
1:10my name is my book around facebook and i got really mad because it melts
1:15we strive to be crazy and this one doesn't melt and it kind of just the
1:18exact same thing so yeah I'm quite a rough one for my foundation i guess
1:25because the brush is so soft it's not how to my face - it feels like a nice
1:28massage if anything so i just really kind of get in there and you to all
1:34circles like this because i find buffing it in like that
1:37get the nicest affect the function gets a nice effect gives the lights the fact
1:44i guess i'm going to see me now and do my eyes my eyebrows now come back and
1:49finish off my skin and you can see their own powder and blush and bronzer and all
1:52the other lovely things that might put my skin it is evening
1:55my eyebrows i've been loving using the Maybelline brow drama in the color dark
2:00brown
2:00I just think this is just such a nice way to start and the process of kind of
2:05getting better eyebrows
2:08I always find it like my brows the most when i use a couple of different
2:12products on them
2:13I know that sounds really high maintenance but what I just use one
2:16products
2:17it can look really good . and draw in whereas when i use a couple and start
2:21with something like this just to give them a little bit more color and shape
2:26like that looks so much better already and that's just one foot out if i'm
2:32feeling lazy some days I just use this on my browser if I'm going for a real
2:36natural makeup look
2:37but because this isn't even make up look I want to come in a little bit more
2:42no you guys are going to freak out when I lift up this palette and said I'm
2:44going to use on my other house because I'm scared I'm actually going to be
2:49using this one and I have no idea why I've got this color in with all these
2:53blues and greens deck ask for any way that one is Mac corduroy i'm going to
2:58just put a little bit of through to fill in my brows i'm going to mix it with mac
3:02Omega which is this where you have actually blondie color here because that
3:07works really well for the front of my brows so I'm just starting with a little
3:11bit of Omega where Omega hope you liked it
3:19ok so i'm just going to get my other out of the same stage but I make it through
3:22it and then my a delicious with Corey
3:25I'm just going to have to eat the best of corduroy sure
3:28through the islands we're gonna need a darker warmer color bad and you can see
3:35that the size i'm going to use is this one here from the chanel quarter TC
3:40Gabrielle some forget names and number 208
3:44it's kind of like Max & totes you could easily satin taupe to achieve the same
3:48look I've just been using this one I want to show you guys exactly what I've
3:52been doing recently with my makeup look I've been going out and i just love easy
3:57and that's why i'm going to use in this tutorial but if you want to you could
4:00find a drugstore gene functions loads I'm maybe we can do some colors like
4:04that so I know
4:05so just got that shade on a mac 239 brush I'm going to put it all over the
4:13lid and I'm taking this all the way up just passed my crease and I'll take your
4:20mac 217 brush I'm going to blend it should be classic guess I was going to
4:24do that
4:24that's what I always do now to intensify the color i'm just going to keep adding
4:30more and blending wall
4:32you could even put a cream eyeshadow underneath if you want to intensify it
4:37even further or an eye primer rose and do like that
4:46now going to take a black priest in shadow this one happens to be
4:49functionality while but you could use any one I only got a black now one and I
4:54did look they've had a drug that once I need you guys prefer it when i use
4:57drugstore makeup but I didn't have a black hole in your brown
5:02this is a black but I know that resembled a remor scandalize black cream
5:07shadow
5:08I need to get that so this I'm just drawing along my lash line
5:14you could even use gel liner for this and then i'm using my - 17
5:19I'm just going to blend this into the shot I don't be afraid to be a bit messy
5:25with it just really kind of blend in
5:30ok so I'm dreams about the same shadow color underneath my eyes and I'm going
5:37to take maxilla pigment haven't used to send a video for ages it's so very
