0:04last-minute easy simple glam holiday

0:13happening like i said in my previous
0:15video I wanted to create something that
0:16everyone can do it is so easy like
0:19literally this look is easier than easy
0:23i know i said on social media that I
0:25wanted to keep those look very simple
0:26and on the low but knowing me I of
0:29course have to go in with a blinding
0:31silver on my lids but I will assure you
0:33that this is super easy to do
0:35anyone can do this it is using mostly
0:38affordable products so this is one that
0:40everyone can do I think this is such a
0:43fun look for winter for whenever you
0:45want to blind anyone with your glam and
0:48yeah if you would like to know how to
0:50get this easy glam makeup look for the
0:53holidays then keep watching
0:55ok the first products i'm gonna go in
0:57with is a primer because you want your
0:58face to last all night long
1:01unless you're not wearing any makeup
1:02then skip whatever i'm saying that
1:04doesn't everybody why are you watching
1:06the video so I'm gonna go in with this
1:08NYX Hydra touch primer and this is to
1:12hydrate and moisturize and I have dry
1:15skin so I need all the moisturization i
1:18can get going to use this as a
1:21moisturizing primer and then on my
1:25t-zone area where I get a little bit
1:27more oily and where my parts are more
1:29visible no go in with the Maybelline
1:32Baby skin instant pore eraser and the
1:35trick with primers like this is to top
1:38them in to the area you don't want to
1:43necessarily wipe or massage it in
1:47because you wanted to really fill up
1:49that poor and you race it so I find that
1:52it does that best when the top in
1:55products like that for this area not
1:58going to go in with the Milani conceal
2:00and perfect two-in-one foundation +
2:03concealer which are lies because i never
2:05used for concealer i use your
2:07information alone
2:08and I'm in the color 01 creamy vanilla
2:11and then with my Beauty Blender and the
2:13bound said into my skin
2:25[Music]
2:27and please use as much foundation as you
2:31are comfortable with using as little or
2:34as much as you like i'm known to like my
2:38layers upon layers upon layers upon
2:40layers but that doesn't mean you should
2:43follow that rule exactly how i do it
2:45please take inspiration from this video
2:47you don't have to exactly copy every
2:50step
2:51do whatever makes you feel comfortable
2:53for concealer today I'm going to go in
2:55with the Maybelline instant age rewind
2:57concealer in the color fair and because
3:07i like a little bit more likeness with
3:09my concealer i'm going to go in with the
3:11pro concealed by la girl in the color
3:14thank you for letting me know my
3:16previous video that they actually do
3:17make a white concealer because they
3:19wouldn't have it
3:26and bouncing that in using my Beauty
3:28Blender again
3:42now i'm going to bake my under eye area
3:45to prevent it from creasing and to make
3:47it look flawless all night long and i'm
3:52going to set the rest of my face using
3:53Maybelline a better skin super-state
3:56powder and number 10
4:03ok
4:04and with my sigma f 89 brush gonna wipe
4:09away the baked underneath my eyes
4:14[Music]
4:19this shouldn't come as a surprise but a
4:23first timing my eyelids to make the look
4:25last all day long
4:27using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I
4:30mean yeah you can try a different primer
4:32I just know that soft ochre ensures me
4:36of having my look on all night for all
4:39day long so i change it up for the
4:41crease and outer corner and going in
4:43with her beauty's rose gold palette in
4:46the shade sandalwood but please trust me
4:49when I say you can use any media warm
4:52brown it doesn't depend which brand just
4:54make sure it's a mat warm medium brown
4:58and I'm starting off by placing most
5:01intensity on the outer corner here
5:05touching the lid and the police to start
5:08making little circle motions to blend it
5:11out and as your blending work your way
5:13up higher up into your crease from there
5:18you can lightly swipe it into the center
5:23of the crease and all I'm doing is soft
5:27circle motion
5:29you know you want to think of it as
5:30whenever you want to blend something out
5:32you want to create circle motions think
5:35of it as the wheels of the blending
5:38brush go round and round then once you
5:41have most definition apply to the outer
5:43portion of the I now you can swipe
5:45whatever is the left in the brush to
5:48work the inner portion of decreased but
5:50dude is very softly and not to hajj now
5:53with a more dense concentrated brush and
5:56that same color really build up
5:59definition on that out of fun here we're
6:02not focusing on the crease here just on
6:04this outer portion super easy just
6:07focusing on that outer portion and
6:09leaving everything else behind now going
6:11to go in with this color pop super shock
6:14shadow this looks amazing and it's in
6:17the color glitterati and you can choose
6:19to apply this color with your fingers or
6:21with the brush and then he is both i
6:23like using my fingers to kind of stamp
6:25the product down onto my lid and then
6:27with the brush I refine the shape
6:30this may be a simple look but i still
6:34want to catch all the attention so over
6:36top of the colour-pop product i'm
6:39applying this Maybelline eye shadow in
6:41the color New York silver for maximum
6:44impact of that shady you want to tap the
6:47product onto the lid so see how I'm not
6:52swiping the brush at all I'm tapping it
6:54up and down this is to get the maximum
6:56coverage of my eyeshadow as a base on my
7:03inner corners are using this mix
7:05lingerie I tint and going over top using
7:08this
7:08inglot pure pigment and number 75
7:11blinding first laying down that cream
7:15product to really make that highlight
7:17pop stick go over top using the link now
7:28I personally obsess over strong inner
7:31corner highlights they just hope that
7:33just made me warm on the inside but if
7:35you feel like that is too much simply go
7:37in with a little q-tip kind of rub the
7:41surface of the highlight to tone it down
7:43and it should become a lot more soft for
7:48the lower lash line and going back in
7:50with that medium brown color from the
7:51crease and applying it to the outer
7:54third of my lower lashline only using a
7:56flat definer brush and we use that flat
8:00definer brush to really pack on the
8:02color and to get it there and then we go
8:04in with a pencil brush to blend and
8:06smoke it out
8:11and by keeping that definition on the
8:16outer portion of the lower lashline only
8:18it will open up the eyes in such a
8:21beautiful flattering way but it won't
8:23drag them down to make him look too
8:24heavy a little bit of white Michael on
8:27the waterline and now all we have to do
8:31is apply some fun flirty lashes these
8:34Arlena lashes in the style Naomi and a
8:39lot of people always ask me how you can
8:41master applying false lashes and in the
8:45screen here i will show you a video that
8:48create a long time ago is not the
8:50technique that he used today anymore but
8:52it definitely helped me getting into a
8:54pine false lashes a lot better so that's
8:56a great way of starting out and in the
8:59screen here you can click the video and
9:00check it out
9:07all right to contract today I'm going to
9:11go in with the makeup geek contouring
9:13powder
9:14I'm gonna go with this shade right here
9:16this one is called a breakup and I know
9:19these are super super pigmented so you
9:21only need the tiniest bit you know find
9:27the top of that cheekbone and go right
9:30underneath to cast a shadow and to make
9:33it look like it's carved most people on
9:36Thanksgiving are carving a turkey I'm
9:38coming with you
9:39oh my god you guys are going to love
9:40this part

9:59the outer corners and the crease and i'm
10:01applying this using the morphe y 1 this
10:04will launch in two days on Friday
10:06nothing tops this blush and having used
10:11in a while because just like all other
10:14products i kinda have the tendency to
10:17use them too many times and I just had
10:20to let it go for a little bit to try out
10:21new things and for you guys to see
10:24different variations on blush because I
10:25was always using woman so and it's kind
10:28of scaring me because now that i'm

1:01alright so since we want to look glowing
1:03and moisturised and a beautiful for
1:06things giving the first thing I'm gonna
1:08go in with is Kim ties and wonder lush
1:10in collaboration with ofra again this is
1:13a test or form I've been with her
1:15through this process since the beginning
1:17so I'm this is not the final but its not
1:20its final form but this moisturizer is
1:24just amazing it leaves a glow it leaves
1:26you looking beautifully taking care of
1:29it's just life and more ah the life
1:33right now for foundation I'm going to go
1:35into a new product this is x la girl and
1:39this is called the pro coverage HD along
1:42where illuminating foundation it looks a
1:45lot like makeup forever i have the color
1:49porcelain right here but they also came
1:53out with a 1l a girl yes yes and yes you
1:59are representing as ghosties out there i
2:02love this i love this you can lighten
2:03any foundation or concealer with this i
2:06love that this is perfect what it's so
2:08revolutionary thank you for breaking the
2:11rules
2:11thank you got that coverage
2:20oh god only girl I see you it has a
2:25lovely dewy finish did have averaged now
2:34if only they could just follow their own
2:37revolution every break of rules by doing
2:40a white concealer as well that will
2:43really make my day I will say though the
2:46foundation remains very wet like do you
2:51see how it's almost what like I have wet
2:54skin like I'm sweating I'm not sure if
2:56I'm the biggest fan of that I kinda like
2:58it when it sets down and becomes a
3:00little bit more dry this is still very
3:03very wet for concealer gonna go in with
3:05the kat von d lock-it concealer creams
3:09in l1 and l3 and I've heard that these
3:14are a little bit more dry so trying to
3:17counteract the wetness of the foundation
3:19with the dryness of the concealer
3:32let's see if this will make it a perfect
3:38mixture of wet and dry
3:48and now going to set my under eye area
3:50to prevent it from creasing
3:59all right now to set the rest of my face
4:01using the Maybelline better skin
4:03super-state powder in 10 but my fear is
4:07with really wet foundations when you set
4:10it with powder it kind of moves the
4:11foundation right before you said it
4:14leaving it looking very disrupted and
4:17like messy so my fear is that that will
4:19happen so before i go in with my powder
4:22just make sure that it's in parish
4:24they're ready to be set with powder
4:27you guys are so sad I had such high
4:33hopes for this foundation once I first
4:36applied it I got so excited because it
4:38has beautiful coverage but it just
4:40remains so wet
4:43alright so the first thing I'm doing as
4:45always is priming using my soft or group
4:48in pot by Mac
4:56and now going to go in with the hoodie
4:58Beauty rose gold palette and going in
5:01first with the color shy or just
5:03blending this into the crease to build
5:06our definition and as a transition color
5:11for all the Jets and darkness that will
5:15come in later and for this look we're
5:17going to go all the way into the inner
5:20crease and all the way out
5:28now using the color bossy i'm going to
5:32deepen and intensify that and again
5:40taking this from inner to outer corner
5:43now to really cut the crease we're going
5:46to cut the lid by using Pro Longwear
5:48concealer by mac and with this we're
5:51going to really clean up the lid going
5:53right up against that crease color to
5:55cut it
6:06and I'm gonna set that all using angelic
6:20now I'm going to blend and smoke out
6:22that crease just at a bit more using a
6:24mix of bossy and man-eater all right now
6:33going to create a wing using my Tom Ford
6:35I defining pen in deeper
6:38from there you want to create your basic
6:44wing and filling in using my favorite
6:49MAC liquid last liner in black
7:03and now from that wing i'm going to
7:05swoop one clean line into the cut crease
7:09and now you want to softly buff black
7:16above that wine to give it a night
7:18planned
7:27for the lower lash i'm going to go back
7:28in with bossy and just smoking up that
7:31outer lower lash line and then on the
7:37inner corner
7:38I'm going back in with angelic and as a
7:44transition right in between going in
7:46with henna going into this beautiful
7:54Murphy highlighting palette and taking
7:57the two pink shades to highlight my
8:00inner corner
8:05all right all we need not to finish off
8:07our lashes and i'm going to go in with
8:10the any 22 snobby lashes and for my
8:18lower lashes are going to be using the
8:20mac extended play get a black lash
8:31alright eyes are done and looking
8:34beautiful for thanksgiving or whatever
8:37your 1m ok so now we're going to go over
8:40to contouring oh I'm so obsessed with
8:43this powder this is better dial and it's

9:29Sigma they create one of my all-time
9:30favorite brushes called the aura powders

0:54further ado if you would like to know
0:56how to get this makeup look right here
0:58then people cheering alright so the
1:00first thing I'm gonna do for this
1:02perrie edwards makeup look is moisturize
1:04my face to get a nice base to work with
1:07and I'm going to be using this little
1:09magic pot right here this is a new /
1:12product that will be launching january

1:23smush Ty's are out for a couple of
1:25months now and I fallen in love with it
1:28and i not only love it as a moisturizer
1:30I think it is perfect to use as a base
1:34underneath your makeup because it really
1:36makes any product that you put over top
1:38grab onto it and really adhere to the
1:41skin so I think it's a great makeup base
1:44and that's why I'm using it today and no
1:46this will not be the final packaging i
1:48cannot even begin to tell you how good
1:51it is to finally be able to talk about
1:53this can let me try this
1:57I think three months ago and I've been
2:00obsessed ever since but I couldn't talk
2:01about it now I finally can
2:05love this stuff for foundation I'm going
2:08to be using this one by Mac this one is
2:10called the pro longwear nourishing
2:12waterproof foundation i'm in the color
2:14and see 15 and this was also the
2:16foundation that her makeup artist used
2:19for her for the music video and i'm
2:21applying this using my Beauty Blender
2:23dog
2:37and for concealer today I'm gonna go in
2:39with the urban decay naked skin
2:41concealer and the color fair neutral and
2:48of course also blending it in order to
2:50render a I'm trying to step away from
2:56using the top shape concealer but after
3:00using the shape tape for so long and
3:02then stepping back to another one it's
3:04just such a disappointment like nothing
3:06in my eyes can compare to shoot at this
3:09moment but nothing and now i'm going to
3:12set my under eye area with powder to
3:15prevent throne creasing that's just that
3:22the rest of my face and go in with this
3:24maybelline superstay better skin powder
3:27i discovered this in New York and ever
3:30since I've been in love with it it just
3:32beautifully sets your makeup and keeps
3:35it on all day long plus it's affordable
3:38I am really really really obsessed with
3:41this one
3:48ok now with Max shivering white powder
3:51going to highlight my under eye area
3:53using this new brush that I've been
3:55really really liking it's the stigma
3:57bake kabuki f-89 brush and I think it's
4:01the perfect size and width and density
4:05for the under eye area to just
4:07flawlessly apply that on your highlight
4:09or just do or just to set your bank or
4:12get rid of your it's just a really
4:14really good under eye brush see it's
4:24pervert already i'm going to do my
4:26eyebrows off camera and then we'll be
4:28back before i do anything on the eyes
4:30and the Prime to make this look last all
4:33day long and this is my mac soft ochre
4:35Paint Pot
4:41the first color I'm going to go in with
4:44is by the morphe 35o em paulo and
4:47discovered here is going into my crease
4:50and we're software going to focus this
4:52more towards the insight crease so see
4:56how I'm pulling focus right here on that
4:59inner crease that's where you want to go
5:03don't your fridge google high up in that
5:07crease if you have a lot of space to
5:09work with use it now hopping over to
5:15this shape right here for more
5:16definition but softer definition in the
5:19crease we're just continuing defining
5:22that crease we just don't want the color
5:26to be as dark and intense on this outer
5:29portion here we want the focus to go
5:31here on that increase
5:44now with the darkest color of the
5:46palette i'm going to define that
5:48increase even more so we're creating a
5:51cut crease definition here and although
5:55we haven't cut the crease really once we
5:58go in with the lip color and really go
6:01against that line it will look as if we
6:04had a couple is going on all the time
6:06and what this i think you can see that i
6:09really mean that we want all the
6:11definition to be a met in our cruise
6:14right here
6:15don't be afraid to go all the way in
6:17hopping over to the morphe 35o shimmer
6:21pallid and taking the very lightest
6:24color to cut the lid and you'll see by
6:26me going right up against that line of
6:28the crease it will give you that cut
6:30crease illusion and continue blinding
6:37that lid using that same shade and also
6:43highlighting the inner corner using that
6:45same shade using a combination of the
6:50two crease colors i'm slightly defining
6:53the outer V for the waterline first
6:56going to go in with these you ways limb
6:58cream eyeliner in matte black
7:10and then taking the darkest color from
7:13the crease again from morphe 35o and
7:16palate and smoking it out and then we're
7:21also bringing that out slightly for my
7:29wing today our first lining out using
7:30the tongue forward I defining in deeper
7:40and fill in using my favorite MAC liquid
7:43last liner all right now with black
7:51shadow is really important to diffuse
7:53and smoke out the outer corner of that
7:56liner and kind of like it out as well so
7:58that is exactly what we're doing with
8:05the pencil brush I'm softly smoking back
8:08out little by little until becomes
8:11beautiful Hayes same sort of like that
8:17nice and smoky for lashes i'm going to
8:20go in with one of my all-time favorite
8:22styles these are be Lily lashes in the
8:25style tease and for the little star I'm
8:29putting down a little bit of lash glue
8:31and then sticking the start right over
8:33top
8:40alright first for cheeks let's do a
8:44little bit and by a little i mean a lot
8:46of contouring I found out about this new
8:49product right here this is my Road aisle
8:51and it's the instant glam compact deluxe
8:56contouring powder and number three and
8:59this is what it looks like
9:00and honestly if you're using it in New
9:02York with Maybelline and it just it has
9:05changed my world you only need a tiny
9:08bit of it it has the perfect color to
9:11make it look like a shadow as an actual

9:50i love that I love it when is the artist
9:52that just upset over glam like I do is

0:00hey guys today I'm doing a review /
0:02tutorial on the new kylie jenner
0:05burgundy pallid this recently came out
0:08and no one kindly during its probably
0:11blowing up the internet but this is what
0:14this gorgeous little creature looks like
0:16now personally before i start off this
0:19got sent to my mom's home address and
0:21every Kylie product i've talked about in
0:24the past before i have bought with my
0:26own money and got sent to this place
0:28right here where i live and i went to my
0:30mom's place and she was like you have a
0:32package so i opened the package up and
0:34it turn out to be highly Jenner and I
0:37was like oh how did she get that address
0:39but I think it's so cool that Kylie sent
0:42me her fall collection now of course
0:44when you are positive about kylie jenner
0:46a lot of people think you're being
0:47bought or you sold your soul or that
0:50you're being sponsored not trust me
0:52Kylie has not sponsored any of my videos
0:54she sells a bunch
0:56she sells enough product without my
0:59support so no Kylie didn't sponsored my
1:02last video she isn't sponsoring this one
1:04and trust me with the FCC rules
1:06I it will be illegal for me not to tell
1:08you if this was sponsored so let's get
1:11that out of the way now let me tell you
1:13about the bronze palette the bronze
1:14palette wasn't really my cup of tea
1:18I love the colors but my main issue with
1:20that palette was that the shimmers were
1:22really not kind of shimmery and the mats
1:25i found that the more you blended them
1:27on your I they all turn out to be the
1:29same color so I wasn't a huge fan of
1:31that pallet now this one however hope
1:33ball i created these very grungy
1:36warm-toned smokey eyes for fall and i
1:39must say i am really impressed with this
1:41palette the palate looks like this and
1:43of course the tears have the colors in
1:45chrome of what's inside
1:48not this is what the inside looks like
1:49it comes with nine shadows which are
1:5312345 maths and for shimmers it still
1:57doesn't include a mirror although Kylie
2:00has set herself on her snapchat that the
2:02next palette will have a mirror and
2:04honey for $42 mirror
2:07yeah we have nine alisios cranberry
2:11warm fall rich I shadows and I
2:16personally I love these colors
2:18especially that metal 1 i'm running on
2:20the inner corners the Malaysian obsessed
2:22so yeah without any further ado let's
2:24hop right into the demo / tutorial on
2:28this look right here using the palette
2:29so you can see how the shadows work on
2:32my eyes how I like them i'll give you my
2:34feedback on every shape that i use and
2:36let's just get comfortable and relax and
2:39let's enjoy this kylie jenner bergen
2:42appellate review all right the first
2:43thing before he'd do anything with this
2:46palette is prime because i want this to
2:48last all day long
2:50this is my mac software her paint pot
2:58the first color gonna go in with is
3:01penny and I'm just defining my crease
3:04with this now as we can see the pigment
3:09on penny is in sane and I love the color
3:13I love the warm i love that orange tone
3:17would still looks it looks like a mat
3:19copper almost is crazy pigmented it
3:23blends into the socket like a dream with
3:27such ease obsessed with penny
3:31now i'm going to go into brick and
3:33defining my inner and outer corner for a
3:36halo smoky eye
3:38ok the pigment of the mats is insane i
3:46read into a couple of problems with the
3:48maps in the previous palette I just felt
3:50like once you blend everything together
3:52it all just kind of looked like the same
3:54color but this is pigmented a velvety
3:57smooth and it just it's so easy to work
4:00with
4:01[Music]
4:04I'm just going to smoke out and blend in
4:08the edges to give it a nice smooth
4:11gradient and to make sexy and seductive
4:16for this halo smokey eye and then a
4:18darkened the inner and outer corner even
4:21more using almond honestly you guys i am
4:27really impressed with the map for the
4:30center of the lid i'm going to go in
4:32with the color dubai okay okay yeah okay
4:36not okay this isn't a bad shadow
4:42I just feel like the consistency is very
4:45thin it's almost as if the shadow is
4:48really thin like it takes a little bit
4:51more effort and pressure to get the
4:53pigmentation of the shimmer to work and
4:57I mean once it's on it's stunning
5:00I just feel like it's it's where to
5:02explain but it's a very thin type of
5:04eyeshadow also not gonna lie i expected
5:07that color to be a little bit more
5:08chromatic and extreme so we're going to
5:11do is go over top with the bronze the
5:13bronze is called la and this is going
5:15right on the center of Dubai ok that is
5:22the stunning color but again I feel like
5:25the shadow itself is a thin shit it's so
5:30hard to swing it's a thinner shadow but
5:33I mean once it's on it is absolutely
5:35stunning and beautiful i just feel like
5:37it's a it's an odd texture for a shimmer
5:40I should because if it's quite fit for
5:42my lower lash I'm gonna go back into
5:43brick and smoke that baby out
5:55and for the inner portion of the lower
5:58lash I'm going to be applying burgundy
6:00oh my god this car
6:05yes ok it has a little bit of all out
6:08that colored oh oh my god its fall in an
6:13eyeshadow ok deepening the entire lower
6:16lash line using almond again and lastly
6:22going to highlight my inner corners
6:23using naked
6:25ok ok i know a lot of people are not the
6:31biggest fan of this color but I think
6:34heard up with all the beautiful warm
6:36tones this on the inner corners makes it
6:39so sultry and different I mean yes it's
6:42too dark for my skin tone but somehow i
6:44don't mind did weirdly enough though the
6:47texture and formula that feels away
6:49different than the other shimmers I used
6:51so this one feels a little bit more
6:53dense a little bit more easy to work
6:55with and Jessica lights on easier to
6:57finish off the look i'll be applying
6:58some falsies these are literally lashes
7:01in the style tease
7:05[Music]
7:14alright so eyes done my cheeks almost
7:16done i think we still need a bunch of
7:19glow for this look because the matter if
7:22its fall winter spring summer we need to
7:25go i'm gonna go in with my current
7:27favorite highlighter which is by morphy
7:29it's a pressed pigment and it's in the
7:31color champagne nights and its just oh
7:34it's everything so i am just go no blind
7:41and we can't forget about the tip of the
7:47nose
7:48you either loved it or hated I guess we
7:50know which team I'm on
7:52and to finish off this look I think it
7:54will only be fitting if I apply a Kylie
7:57lip kit color dirty peach page or mm-hmm
8:05from God
8:09let's do moon to make it super super
8:11fall in like
8:27all right just like that now we're going
8:28to do a little spritz of settings free
8:31to lock this into place and we call it a
8:34day and that guy's is how the kylie
8:42jenner burgundy paulo works on the eyes
8:46I overall think it's a really really
8:48cool palette I mean the shimmers do need
8:51a little bit more love when applying
8:53them but the man would talk about the
8:55mats the mats are absolutely insane
8:58they're smooth buttery painted and they
9:01are so easy to work with
9:02I am really really impressed by these
9:04maths my absolute favorite shade of the
9:06entire palette is penny it is just so
9:09rich and the ability to make it look
9:13like a mat copper is insane to me i love
9:16it so much so um yeah
9:18for me the kylie jenner burgundy palette
9:21gets a huge he has a highly recommended
9:24it is a pricey palette is $42 but i do
9:28think it's worth it as always i do want
9:30to just claim that makeup is a personal
9:32game something may work for you and it
9:34may not work for me

9:37experience and please don't judge me on

0:03vibes makeup tutorial I'm doing these
0:05very clean flirty warm-toned eyes but
0:09still very clean and easy and simplistic
0:11to do with the pressure on clean and
0:13simplistic because people have been
0:15demanding it from me and then of course
0:16I needed my touch of glam so I a dish
0:19that highlighter and glossy bronze
0:22metallic red lips yummy i am seriously
0:26obsessed with this look I think it
0:28screams ball i think it is so sexy and
0:32seductive and clean and simplistic and
0:34easy and you know that any forever do if
0:36you like to know how to get this look
0:37right here then please keep watching
0:40alright so the first thing I want to do
0:41for this fall Vybz makeup look is sort
0:45of prime not really going to apply a
0:46primer because I'm just filming this and
0:49then I'm taking it off and i'm going to
0:50sleep and then i'm going to the airport
0:52and going in with the touch of dewy skin
0:54missed and just going to spray and and
0:58soak up the moisture
1:03I'm gonna go in with the air flash
1:06foundation by dior and I am in the color
1:10100 now little side note this is the
1:12last time I'm giving this a shot
1:15I've tried this numerous amount of times
1:16and every time I tried it I absolutely
1:18hated it so I'm giving it one more shot
1:21and if I hated after this it's going to
1:23be no God oh it's gonna be one I don't
1:26care it's gonna be one so what I did in
1:28the past was kind of keep it at a
1:30distance and then spray myself and it
1:32would end up everywhere my shirt my
1:34hairline my nose hair browse ears teeth
1:38everywhere so not today today going to
1:40keep it very close to my actual face and
1:44tried to try and make this work
1:54what the brush on a blended in and hope
2:02for the best that are ready is one of
2:06the best tries its ever had on my face
2:08usually it would just go everywhere and
2:11not cover anything i would have to go
2:13layer upon layer upon layer right now
2:16that's a pretty damn girl i mean so many
2:21people love this foundation they're like
2:24it's my holy grill it makes my skin look
2:26at best it has amazing coverage and
2:29every time people would say that I'd be
2:31like fish well so what a lot of my
2:34friends do is use this as a base
2:36foundation and then go in with a classic
2:40foundation over top in areas that you
2:42needed so maybe I'm gonna have to get
2:45that shot because so far no no God no
2:49i'm not going to go in with my classic
2:51Foundation which is two-faced born this
2:53way and picking up a little bit more on
2:55my brush and in areas where i always
2:58prefer a little bit more coverage i'm
3:01going to apply that right on top of top
3:03of cheekbones just a thin layer which we
3:10all know is a lie because I don't work
3:12in layers can I just say this day is
3:14full of surprises or ready i use the air
3:17flash foundation because i always need
3:19it i wanted to give it one last shot
3:21same goes for this brush this is the
3:24morphe and 439 I usually never really
3:27liked it because i feel like it leaves
3:29me streaky and patchy and uneven but
3:32today is actually the first day we're
3:33actually with this brush for concealer
3:36today of course heart-shaped tape and
3:38fair it's it's it's not even a question

4:18base on my lid
4:26on the center of building i'm not gonna
4:29pie mystic hour and i'm putting mystic
4:32our over top of a black base because I

4:40and outer corners i'm applying wham bam
4:42and if you haven't tried when them over
4:45top of the blackberries yet highly
4:48suggest you doing it because we'll make

5:47inner corners using the Catrice glam
5:50fusion eyeshadow and wait for it wait

6:03waiting for I'm gonna go in with my
6:05glitter and today i'll be using the mac
6:08transparent eel reflex make it stick for
6:11some lit clearly with glitter base just
6:14a very very thin layer and then let's
6:18get crazy
6:27oh I want to feel bathtub with the stuff
6:32and dunk my body in it right now to seal
6:34the deal i'm going to apply some falsies
6:36and today i'll be using my trusty Lily
6:39lashes in NYC
6:52alright we got these smoky mermaids
6:54swimming on our eyeballs but now it's
6:56time to snatch the face so first things
7:00first I'm going to contour my cheekbones
7:02because we are in need of some snatching
7:05this right now I'm gonna give you a pot
7:07with today I'm not going to contour
7:09using my morphe m530 this is my baby
7:11this is my everything but sometimes you
7:13gotta change it up a little bit today
7:15I'm gonna go in with this newest Sigma
7:17powder sweep f06 brush now I think this
7:21is meant to brush away baking or
7:23whatever you want with it but i think
7:25this is insane to contour with like
7:28insane and of course as always going to
7:30contour using my camera quantum medium
7:32sculpting powder so i'm going to pick up
7:34some on the brush and tap tap and I
7:38don't know how this brush does it but it
7:41has enough sturdiness and like denseness
7:47to it that it can really really like
7:49really accurately snatch that contour
7:53for you but then it also has this like
7:55flimsiness and softness to it to just
7:58effortlessly blend and define its it's
8:02insane
8:02this brush has been doing for me lately
8:04it's all I conduit they leave it is like
8:07now I just still going with my m4 44 by
8:10$OPERAND more feet with my face powder
8:12and clean up underneath around it and at
8:16the base
8:17same old same old I will always do this
8:20to make sure that my contour looks flow
8:26now I feel like we need a little bit of
8:28bronzer on our face today so I'm gonna
8:30go in with the chocolate soleil bronzer
8:31from the power of make a pallet and at
8:34first it's going to warm up my hairline
8:37very slightly because if I do this too
8:40much I look muddy and disgusting and
8:43then also just right at the contour to
8:46warm it up and diffuse it out and give
8:49yourself that tan and the very quickly
8:52without paying too much attention to it
8:54i'm going to contour my nose just a tiny
8:56bit using light sculpting powder by
8:58kevin kline
9:00[Music]
9:05[Music]
9:07just quick and easy just like that going
9:10to go in with a lady slipper or a powder
9:12which looks like this and my morphe and
9:15509 brush and I'm just going to pick up
9:17at any minute and really softly I'm
9:20gonna add a tiny teeny bit of color just
9:24very minimal she said she applied 10
9:29pounds of blush lived and never
9:33highlighter and then i use a new
9:34favorite this is citrine powder
9:37highlighter buy UA now citrine sold out
9:40like in a day but i will tell you that
9:42the darker one topaz is almost the same
9:46the only difference is that with topaz
9:49the base is just a tad bit warmer but
9:51citrine is the one that stole my heart
9:53so I'm going to use that today and i'm
9:55going to blind like a moment and then
10:03with this am also going to highlight my
10:05cubed bow and then with the tip of my
10:09ring finger I'm gonna pick up a little
10:11bit more and i'm going to highlight the
10:13tip of the bridge right right
10:24so when I was in Paris with issue way I
10:28wanted a super beautiful new lip but I
10:30wanted to give it like a twist so I went
10:33in with buff lip cream one of my
10:36all-time favorites because it's such a
10:38beautiful nude liquid lipstick that
10:41works i'm going to be a pine bluff first

1:37party
1:38perfect to use kind of make a paper in half with your eyeliner it's just a very
1:43fun glittery festive party look
1:47yeah i created the Superfund glam look using the two phase power of makeup

1:57now last time with all the purples and that's it without any further ado if you
2:01would like to know how to get this party glam crease on brain makeup look
2:05featuring the power of makeup which is logic tomorrow
2:09let's keep watching alright so let's get this glam look started i'm gonna drink
2:13my Beauty Blender in one of my favorite moisturizers and I'm gonna pick it up on
2:17that beauty blender and with this i'm going to moisturize my skin and what
2:22this will do is of course this will prep your face for foundation to make
2:26everything going smoothly and beautifully
2:30I'm just the way you want it but also because you're applying that foundation
2:35with your Beautyblender your Beautyblender will absorb some of that
2:38moisturizer and then once you start using it for your foundation it's going
2:42to mix in and create this lovely blend of a nourishing foundation and that will
2:48make your foundation go in even more beautiful
2:51it will just melt into the skin so nicely one of my favorite tricks to just
2:57transform a foundation into Photoshop skin for foundation today I'm going to
3:02go in with Too Faced Born This Way and i always use the color snow and pearl I
3:06mix them together to get the perfect match with that same beautiful
3:10understood dabbing it onto the skin
3:22yeah
3:25for concealer today i'll be going in with the tart shaped concealer in fair
3:30and to make it even lighter and go in with Kat Von D's a cream concealer in
3:35white out the heart really going to highlight with this is rach assistance
3:42is a very glam look
3:51and the whiteout just mixed into the tart one just dotting it in and same
4:03Beauty Blender and we're going to bounce that in
4:14I using mine are soft velvet loose powder and snow i'm going to bake my
4:18under eye area as always the first thing i'll be doing is the priming my eyelids
4:27using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and using Ivy I'm gonna set my brow bone to
4:37crease area to help lending later on with the two-faced sketch marker in
4:47black which is included in the kid first going to map out the outer shape of the
4:52eye from there with a precise angle brush and picking up the dark black from
5:01the palette called wanted and just shaping out that outer corner and
5:05filling the outer third in with that same brush and same color picking up
5:14some makeup and chill and with this I'm gonna blend from the black onto the lid
5:19and this is going mainly on the center of the lid blending in with that black
5:28now picking up painkiller and learning that right next to make up and chill
5:39going back in with ivy and really highlighting the inner third and inner
5:44corners
5:49now going to pick up makeup and chill and i'm going to create a new crease and
5:58make sure you have a little bit of room for some glitter with painkiller and
6:02make a potential and a fine liner brush I'm going to blow and blend that out
6:06even more and because it's such a small area and it can be a little tricky to
6:13blend it out would I like to do is place up eyeliner brush laughs onto my skin
6:19and with short strokes kind of drag it up to create a blend you can always go
6:27back in with makeup and chill only Andrea intensified the base of that new
6:31crease as a base for the glitter and to make the glitter go on even sparkly er
6:37I'm gonna grab Urban Decay's heavy metal glitter in glam rock and this is going
6:42right in between those two lines and quickly setting it with the glitter from
6:49the kit
6:56with the sketch mark liner and creating a basic wing
7:04for the bottom i'm taking makeup and chill and buffing it on the outer
7:09corners of my lower lashline and with painkiller I'm just continuing defining
7:16my lower lashline some what I call on the waterline and with the white liner
7:23i'm placing a little white dot on the inner corners of my eyes and to finish
7:27the look off i'm going to do is apply some lashes that these are goddess
7:30lashes by Coco lashes
7:41alright for cheeks the first going to cut them using my camera quan medium
7:49sculpting powder
7:57and with a delay 140 brush and just gonna intensify the base of that contour
8:03and lend it out and then grab your face powder in your face brush and go right
8:11underneath to clean the line or rounded and even right over top of the base of
8:18the contour to soften it that will give you really airbrushed perfect contour
8:25finish for blush I'm going to go into my power of make a pallet and mixing both
8:29blushes for a beautiful pinky coral and for a killer glow today i'll be using
8:40the sugar-coated from the palette this unfair skin tone as a highlighter is hi
8:50there
8:51no this is the stuff I live for
8:56let's not forget about that nose Cupid's for lepers going to hi Tom for nude
9:08vanilla because this nude is just it works with everything and I think the
9:12eyes are so special I want all the attention to go to hear
9:21and then over top will be applying the over metallic liquid lipstick in
9:27Versailles
9:34and to finish you want to lock this all in place with a setting spray and i'll

10:17some researching online for a night out and she looked up her favorite makeup
10:21tutorials
10:22so this is harley quinn but glam
0:00it is the city today I'm here to do a zendaya inspired makeup tutorial is
0:04India always slays the makeup game but when i saw this look on Instagram and
0:09everyone started bombarding me with requests I was like okay I'm doing this
0:13I'm doing this I'm doing this but before i start i want to thank each and every
0:17one of you because my channel hit four million subscribers and I'm going to
0:23keep it short and sassy because if i if i go into it too much i will cry but I

0:34stuff now
0:35I love you so much i love you i don't wanna cry so when I was planning this
0:38look I was like I want to make sure that i pronounced as india right so I search
0:42for how to pronounce india and so my mind said was like waiting for someone
0:48to properly tell me how to pronounce india so I go to youtube this is the
0:53first video i click in our hear things sorted oracle sortie oracle already door
1:04so i told everyone at my snapchat about this and people died and this channel
1:09right here is the bomb so this channel right here is called pronunciationmanual
1:14my favorite one is zucchini
1:25all right I'm done if you want to know how to get this is or need or goal its
1:31entire makeup tutorial right here then keeping watch beeping the first thing
1:35i'll be doing is priming my face I'll be going in with the Knicks Hydra touch
1:39primer and Kim Tae raised about this all the time so I'm going to try it out
1:44today
1:45distributed all over run it but doesn't look like a really nice
1:50tacky base to work with so I'm ready for foundation for foundation today i'll be
1:55using the girl and time proof foundation in the number to base Claire and I
2:00thought why not change it up for once I'm not going to use my beauty blender
2:03and then we use the brush it's been forever since i use a brush for my
2:06foundation and i'm going to use the morphe g36 brush
2:11all right then got that makes the foundation go on beautifully I was a
2:18little skeptical at first with having used a brush for condition forever
2:22again it looks good it's faster than a Beauty Blender - so I'm liking this
2:30and everybody like this more if you want i did in my first time trying it so I
2:33didn't know what to expect but it
2:35it's good i'm really excited about that but my base is a little bit too dark so
2:39I'm going to lighten it up with a little bit of concealer and by a little bit i
2:42mean a lot
2:43so the concealers that we go in with today are the urban decay naked skin
2:47concealer in fair neutral and amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
2:52so going in with amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
2:57first I am
3:04yeah
3:05all right never mind about the Urban Decay concealer I'm keeping it at the
3:10amazing concealer only and in my opinion nothing once concealer in like a Beauty
3:15Blender so for concealer i am using the Beauty Blender
3:25yeah
3:26yeah
3:30and with a loose powder I'm going to step my under eye area to prevent it
3:34from creasing
3:41and now grabbing my Armani luminous silk powder and my morphe m 4 44 and setting
3:47the rest of my face
3:54yeah
3:57and then for larger areas of my face and then switch over to the morphe be 54
4:02which I know the classic ii collection by morphy is discontinued they're no
4:07longer available
4:08but i also know they just came out with a brand-new line the early to collection
4:14which is basically the same brushes but better and i have yet to receive them i
4:18did order couple and once i have them i'll let you know what I think of it on
4:23snapchat and right here
4:24but for now i'm using my trusty old C 50 people and to highlight my under eye
4:29area and to brush away the baking going in with Max shivering white studio fix
4:34powder and i'm going to use a more fiji 35 to use this and I know these are hard
4:39to get by
4:40I personally got mine off of ebay because they couldn't find them in the
4:44stores anymore but maybe they're just so that and we'll come back but i don't
4:50know i don't
4:51and the best part about this is that it looks absolutely horrendous right now
4:56but once you do your contour blush highlight everything
5:01it will all just kind of melt in with each other and it will just look for
5:06eyes the first thing i'll be doing is applying a base of course to keep this
5:10eye on all day long and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot from this
5:21a little trick to make blending easier is applying a lighter matte eyeshadow
5:27from creasing brow bone area and this will just help lend anything you put
5:32over top so much so I'm doing that right now with a matte black eyeshadow first
5:37gonna wing out my lid and for this amusing morphy m1 6116 brush
5:44go ahead and fill that in and now we have a nice direction to go with for the
5:55rest of the lid to cut the little using the mac pro longwear concealer and a
6:00sigma l 05 brush and with this we're going to create our lid shape on the
6:08inner third i'm going to set that using Color rain Malibu eyeshadow and of
6:13course you want to stay inside that cut lip line
6:22yeah
6:23and on the center of the village this danessa Marik's metals pigment in sequin
6:34yeah
6:39yeah
6:43yeah
6:45not going to grab the more few 35p palette and taking this color right here
6:50and with a cara de 22 brush I'm going to cut right above that line to create a
6:55new crease
7:01and then now with a small little more fee fi 15 brush on a bus and blend that
7:10out
7:16and I know I say this all the time but the higher you get up the less pressure
7:21you want to put on the brush to make a beautiful blend you can always go in
7:28with a large brush to soften the edges and make it seamless on the water line
7:35will be upon these two for our contour inner rim gel liner in black and going
7:43back in with my morphe 35p palin and going into these two colors right here
7:48for the lower lash line using a sigma e 05 brush to apply it
7:59and then right at the outer corners you want to wing that purple out parallel to
8:03the wing and with Anasazi Beverly Hills pink heart i'm going to highlight my
8:12inner corners
8:16and also highlighting the brow bone
8:20for lashes today i'll be using the lily lashes in the style goddess
8:33all right let's move on to cheeks were cheating on a contra first because India
8:41is like sculpting to Collins
8:43I'm gonna go in with my makeup geek a breakup cool toned
8:47I'm gonna go in with my makeup geek a breakup cool toned contouring powder and
8:54my morphe and 5 30
9:05all right for blush I've been dying to show you this on camera i've already
9:08used it like so much on a day-to-day basis plus on the snap tutorial i did
9:13last week but it's finally time to show you this precious beauty here on camera
9:18here on YouTube for blush I'm gonna use the morphine nine and blush palette

9:33it contains all my favorite blush colors I really love the peachy war me sexy
9:39bronzy blush colors and this is it right here all in one pallet plus it's super
9:44affordable and i'm going to go in with this one we're here and this one right
9:47here and apply it using a more p.m. 509 brush it is super super pigmented so a
9:56little bit goes a long way
9:58trust me on this one so you definitely want to use a light hand because if you
10:03go too strongly
10:04you're gonna have a lot of clowns running for their money
10:07but hey I look like a car right now i love it i love my k-cup so who cares
10:12now what I'm even more excited about to show you on camera - I already talked
10:15about this in my June hits in the God knows but I've never shown you like in a
10:19video how it goes on to the face again I did show you in my snap tutorial last
10:23week but here we go
10:25this is my artist Couture diamond glow powder in cocoa bling

10:58you know what I never knew that in my life I wanted to have sexy wet glass
11:02cheekbones
11:03but honey now that i have them i will go over the bridge of the nose and the 2i
11:13means India's cheeks look like a magical shining aura of light so i think we
11:19pretty much know that today
11:20all right for lips it's actually really easy just want a very neutral
11:24softly glossy lip so whenever I hear that I'm like okay we need something
11:28neutral effect extreme gloss but somehow my brains transformed the word neutral
11:33and stuffed into extreme and out there so for lipstick today I'm going to go in
11:37with my tongue forward and new to vanilla lipstick because it's a
11:40beautiful nude
11:48after a gloss over talking to go in with this beautiful shape right here this is
11:52by you wait

11:57something I've never done in my life for sure
12:06and all you want to do now to lock it all in place and get rid of a super
12:11cakey and powdery look is set your face with a setting spray and i'm going to go
12:16in with the make up for ever miss and fix and something super random i found
12:20out is as opposed to like spring your face like straight on like what you want
12:23to do is kind of tell your face and come with the spray from up top and that way

1:41out so let's see how it goes
1:45then apply and this will give you a very minimum weight of foundation on your

0:00hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial with the beloved modern renaissance
0:05alibi on the sauce a Beverly Hills when I got this palette i'm going to be
0:08honest I was like a lot of red but then when it finally started playing with it
0:12i am in love with you
0:15I think the modern renaissance palace by Anasazi Beverly Hills is really really
0:19cool
0:20it has a bunch of warm red homes and warm Browns but its overseas highly can
0:25do so many looks with this so today i went for the super glam red smokey eyes
0:31with the pink touch and some glitter some humongous false lashes and metallic
0:36lips because I'm all about the metallic - lately because also in this video i'll
0:40be using a lot of new products some products I've never used on camera
0:44before but if love before and some products I've never tried so this video
0:48is going to be a wind of fresh air with new products on camera so i cannot wait
0:53to show you how i did this and if you want to know how I did this and keep
0:57watching
0:58alright so throughout today video i'll be trying a lot of new products and I'm
1:02so excited to share with you my first impressions
1:05so the first product i'm going to go in with is by benefit this right here is
1:08the total moisture facial cream
1:11this is my first time applying this on camera i've been using this for about
1:14two weeks now a real life and i'm really enjoying what it's doing for my face
1:21before applying makeup
1:23I wouldn't really use it as a moisturizer for my skin care but I do
1:27think it moisturizes the skin perfectly for makeup so i really like it for
1:32makeup moisturizing information today I'm going to go in with this girl and
1:36why
1:37and this is called to New the public's you on which is a high friends think
1:41that's what he called time proof foundation ultimate lasting perfection
1:44think I got the color to which I feel like this will be a little bit to turn
1:48out a little bit this will be too dark for me
1:50we're going to mix it with a lighter foundation something very new for me
1:54mmm this right here is an artiste brush and we all recognize our toothbrushes
1:59because they look like little like one of those showerheads and this right here
2:04is the fool went at overall number eight and i'm just going to pick up some of
2:08the foundation on the brush and with this you're just going to foundation
2:12phase up and that's where using the RTS brushes for your foundation is one of
2:19the fastest ways of doing your foundation because you literally just
2:23brush it on and the brush does all the work for you
2:26and what I find so amazing about these brushes is that they really give you the
2:31most coverage you could wish for in your foundation other brushes are like a
2:35Beauty Blender you get a lot of coverage but sometimes you feel like the brush or
2:39the product you're using to apply your foundation with it kind of takes away
2:44the pigmentation and coverage that the Foundation provides with this it just
2:49keeps the ultimate amount of coverage in the brush and you're just smear and
2:54apply it on and it does the work for you it's it's amazing for concealer i'll be
2:59trying two new ones today the first one is going to be x amazing cosmetics and
3:04this right here is the amazing concealer in ivory and then also the brand new
3:08heart shaped tape contour concealer in fair and then mix it to first going in
3:13with the amazing concealer on the inner part of my under eye
3:20that's why i love that print that appreciates us
3:24tasty ghosts out there and the tar concealer right here on the tops of my
3:30cheekbones and to blend it and i'll be using my new more feet
3:36beauty sponge I have no idea what this is called it the black one and I'm
3:40wondering actually knew sponges other than the beauty blenders always kind of
3:48scare me because the Beauty Blender is the only one that is like so soft and
3:53blend the concealer in like perfection
3:56so any other sponge kind of scares me because usually they're harder and more
3:59rough and they kind of take a way foundation and we like patches and holes
4:05in your base but so far this morphy one looks looks really good
4:09a moment of truth under eye area
4:18ok just looking beautiful so far
4:23to make i'll be using mine arse powder in snow and again I'm kind of afraid
4:28because with the beautiful you have like a nice tip to go underneath your eyes
4:32with the loot
4:34ok so not gonna lie
4:39really impressed with this it is harder to go underneath the eyes with this so i
4:44might not use it for powder but so far it's it's really nice
4:48now with a loose powder and my morphe e51 brush I'm going to try the alyssa
4:53ashley technique she picks up way too much powder douses it all over the face
4:58and busted in and then wife's i'll be excessive powder away so too much powder
5:02too much
5:08notes are roughing it in and that is how she sets the face to blend in my under
5:15eye area i'm going to go into the max shivering white powder and with this i'm
5:19just going to brush away the baked and highlight my under eye area
5:28the first thing i'll be doing as always is priming my eyes using this camp up by
5:33Mac called soft ochre with more face porcelain eyeshadow on the set my crease
5:41the brow bone area to help lending later on and doing so using a mac 252 brush
5:54let's dive into the Anasazi Beverly Hills modern renaissance
5:58hello I'm going to go in with the color bond fresco first and with a more fiemme
6:03504 brush
6:04I'm just gently applying that to the crease and slow and steady start adding
6:09more layers of fun fresco to create more depth
6:17you can always go back in with porcelain by morphy and that mac 252 brush and
6:22clean up the shape and the blending if you've gone too far up or you're just
6:28not feeling
6:29what are you seeing this is kind of your eraser all right now going into this
6:33beautiful color right here called Venetian red and with my favorite lower
6:38lashline brush this one is by morphy I talked about this and snapchat this is
6:41the end 508
6:43this is perfect to pack on color on the lower lash line
6:50from the palette i went in with red ochre and i'm using back here on the
6:54outer corner to meet in that crease and then with a little more fee fi 14 i'm
7:00just going to blend and both that in the outer corners
7:12now going in with a small synthetic angled brush and creating a new inner
7:18corner on the lower lash line
7:27to cut the lid I'm not going in with the mac pro longwear concealer in NC 15 and
7:33this is like cutting the crease but we already put a crease in so by cutting
7:37the lid you mimic a cut crease and to cut the lid of using a sigma lip lo5
7:43brush
7:52overtop i'll be applying for mirror of course you want to stay inside that cut
7:57lip line on the center of the little be applying this is you a pink pearl powder
8:05eyeshadow and on the inner third of the live i'll be applying the steel a
8:13metallic rose quartz
8:21quickly highlighting my inner corners using porcelain by morphy again

8:39these are my new bouncing called Bella and they're my new obsession
8:43they are so full so fluffy so amazing is so we've just modern renaissance to our

2:27I don't think people know how hard it is for Pihl people to have a highlighter on
2:31your eye area
2:33so this pallid having that white color that looks beautiful on the skin gives
2:38us pill pasties out there the opportunity to look highlighted as
2:43always the first thing we'll be doing is applying a base and this is my mac soft
2:47ochre Paint Pot i'm using a sigma 3d HD precision brush to apply this

3:23increase right here blow it up go crazy and smoke it out
3:37ok
3:38now i'm going to take violence and mix that on the outer corners and using the
3:43morphe m5 14 for this i'm going to start of by darkening the outer corners here
3:49on the lid and then sweep it up into the crease you really want to build this up
3:58you don't want to have this huge amount of violence packed on and then you won't
4:04be able to blend anymore know you want to build it up
4:07they have a nice gradiation between the pink and violence
4:11so it's picking up a little by little and start tipping and intensifying the
4:18outer be all right now going in with vanity and that stain brush and
4:25deepening that outer corner even more
4:27and again you want to build this up darken the outer corner but don't go too
4:34fast

4:52illusion of a cut crease but we're cutting the lid since we already put the
4:55crease in

5:08and this is going on the center of the lid you want to stay inside the line of
5:12that new cut lip / crease then going back in with violence and blending it
5:24with rich bitch on that lid and on the inner lid i'm applying princess
5:34notice how i left this little portion here on the inner lid untouched

5:48glossy makeup and these are called Chelsea
5:58yeah
6:00now on this hot summer day we met was a part of sweat but we still want to
6:04exaggerate that we want to look sculpted and and like ready to to you know it's
6:09just I just went to school so i'm going to go in with the capital quantum medium
6:13sculpting powder and my favorite contouring brush the morphe m530 and a
6:19contour with that they're not a contour lover
6:23by all means skip this keep it fresh
6:27but Mama's gotta sculpt and then hopping over to my 140 brush by the way that and
6:35it's tiny bit of that contouring powder as well and really like really
6:42exaggerating the hollowness hollowness and then with your face powder
6:50underneath you can clean it up and make it look even more
6:57i'm also going to do a little bit of bronzing i'm going to go in with the
7:01cover effects bronzer in sun kissed and my Cosette number one brush I'm going to
7:07just this lightly around the hairline lightly also a little bit over that
7:14contour almost kind of as the blush a little bit on the chin
7:25and on the nose for watching going to use this mac blush in what I fancy and
7:32my new favorite blush brush
7:33I know the Co said number to brush is amazing for blush but I feel like it
7:39almost kind of lift the foundation and powder and kind of leaves holes in your
7:44base and this brush just one more feet this is the M 509 brush this just glides
7:51blush on like a dream
7:52so this is happening this brush is just so feather soft it just glides the blush
8:00on without disturbing the base
8:03I love it
8:07all right time to glow and I wanted this look to be all about the globe's so we
8:12have really flirty eyes beautiful skin but i want a glow
8:17I want this glow to be like when you're on the beach and you're wearing this
8:21glow
8:22I want people to think that your glow as the Sun your glow is stronger than the
8:27Sun and in order to do that I have a trick
8:30we're gonna spray are faced with a setting spray and by the time it's
8:35almost dry but it's still a little bit damn that's what you want to apply your
8:39highlighter it's the same as with eyeshadow when you use a damp brush it
8:44will go on so much more intense singles for highlighter so if you use
8:48so we're going to spray your face and then wait for it to be almost dry
8:52the perfect amount of dampness and then we apply highlighter and it's really
8:56going to count and for this we use the moonstone by becca and the setting spray
9:00i'll be using is by urban decay and this is the all nighter and give it a shake
9:04so we're going to do one half one half
9:10all right almost dry BAM
9:15can we take a seat
9:18can we take a seat
9:26not only will that make your glow last longer it will do this which is amazing
9:34almost mother of holy highlighters
9:43I'm sorry if you're watching this video with your parents in the room they'll
9:46probably think you're watching porn uh ok tip of the nose
9:50that's not forget and we don't need a damn place for this because the
9:56highlight on the nose is strong enough as it is
9:59and of course Cupid's bow alright ten-four lips
10:04all right now for this look I feel like you can go with ever you want for lips
10:08you can go bright dark nude matte glossy whatever is in between
10:14you can do whatever you want now I personally feel like this look is so
10:17much about the skin and about this flirty eyes
10:21I want to apply nude glossy lips just to keep it very sexual and summerish and
10:27just that
10:30so I'm a lightly going to outline my lips using the colour-pop lippie pencil
10:35in BFF
10:41yeah
10:41and then with the tiny brush i'm actually going to diffuse the center of
10:45the lip liner see what a lovely like about that gives by diffusing the center
10:54here but diffusing it just a little bit of it really gives you that j.lo like
10:58without that's a half over
11:02ok for loops are first going in with mel cosmetics sext just to kind of fill
11:09everything in over that lip liner
11:21all right and you a little bit more warmth in this lip so I'm going to go in

0:05lemonade and i'm not really doing a look inspired by Beyonce and more so doing
0:10they look to inspire you to wear to the formation tour
0:14so let's say you were one of the lucky few to actually get tickets to go see

0:36get this Beyonce lemonade inspired makeup tutorial then please keep
0:40watching
0:41alright so the first thing we're going to do today is hydrate and for this is
0:45going to use today the Mario Badescu skin care facial spray and this contains
0:50a lot of rose water and lately I've been on a rosewater kick
0:53so i've been using this to kind of lock in moisture and hydrates i'm going to do
0:58that before we get in with the foundation smells amazing so just let
1:04your skin Stoke this up and then we are ready for foundation today for
1:08foundation i'll be using the new clinique beyond perfecting foundation
1:11and I'd be really really loving this one lately i'm in the color . 5 breeze and i
1:16were really loving this one because this one provides full coverage which you
1:20know i'm all about but yet it feels like nothing and it looks like a natural
1:24matte finish which is what I wish for in the foundation and I also make it is
1:29because it comes with a doe foot applicator which I like because you can
1:34evenly distribute the product all over the anyways let's get your plan
1:37so I'm just going to distribute some unto my face and buy some money
1:43enough for me
1:50I'm gonna blending using my Beauty Blender and you definitely want to tap
1:54the foundation in to get the most coverage but just look how much it
2:00covers any redness and flaws but still looks like natural skin
2:10another reason why i really like this one is because it stays on like a dream
2:17I wear this to an event in Dubai and it lasted for the entire day and didn't
2:21have to touch up
2:23it just looked perfectly flawless all day long and just people can we shut up
2:30to clinic for actually having a color light enough for my pasty Whiteface
2:34not a lot of brands have that option and the point five breeze color is amazing
2:39it's an exact match
2:41all right i'm loving this finish it's time for concealer for concealer today
2:45I'm gonna make a mixture with my bye-bye on your eye by a cosmetics and light and
2:50this new product for me this is by sephora and it's called the smoothing
2:54and brightening concealer and this is in the color Clara light one so popping bye
3:00bye under eye on earth
3:05right we're gonna ask them for some extra money and again going back in with
3:11my Beauty Blender and one solid
3:17and now i'm going to set it use mine arse powder in the snow
3:23all right now with my morphe m 4 44 and is a loter double wear powder and just
3:32going to set the remaining remaining parts of my face and they usually for my
3:41forehead and like using IE before consists a little larger and makes it
3:47quicker and for my under eyes are going to take the morphe 49 and mix double
3:52wear powder within our snow and apply that under my eyes to blend in the bank
4:01the first thing we're going to do four eyes is a pie base to keep this look on
4:04all day throughout that entire concert and I'm gonna go for max after great
4:09pain pot and to apply them using is Sigma 3 HD precision brush from the
4:17morphe 35o all mac palin going to take the lightest lightest shade and with a
4:22mac - 50 - I'm just going to set everything from my brow bone to crease
4:27with that color to help lending later on
4:30for the crystal be taking this color right here and mixing it with this one
4:39and with my morphe and 5 11 i'm just going to apply that to the crease
4:43softly now hopping over to the morphe 35o all shimmer palette and taking the
4:56lightest shade all the way in the top left and with my luck c 211 brush i'm
5:01just going to highlight my brow bone which i never do because I always keep
5:06my bride will Matt but for today i went for shimmer now going with this color
5:10right here for the lid and using a mac 242 to apply this
5:18and going over top a little with that whiter shade and also really
5:26highlighting the inner corners
5:29alright hopping back to the 3500 map palette and taking a warmer darker brown
5:36and with my morphe m5 14 just going to darken that Chris a tiny bit more
5:44all right now stand for the liner i'm going with my ardency Inn punker rock on
5:51liquid liner to create my outline and from the tip bring it back to the lash
5:58line and then connect the inner corner to the rest of the wing now going to
6:05feel everything in using line a sleigh is Sigma into color legend
6:10ok now we're going to create a new inner corner so extended with that same liquid
6:23liner
6:26and then I like taking my Oprah fix on eyeliner gel in black to really get that
6:33inner corner there
6:38all right now let's focus on the yellow and then go in with my yellow submarine
6:45six light eyeliners on my old friend I'm going to place it right underneath that
6:49you in a corner and then drag it out and that will be the yellow
6:53so with a Smith - 12:00 brush first laying down that eyeliner gel and then
7:03quickly right after said it with a yellow and I'm gonna go in with color
7:09pop scream gel liner in punch on my waterline and don't be afraid to drag
7:13this on to the actual lash line as well and also setting this with the yellow
7:21eyeshadow and i'm using well cosmetics neon and also dragging it out
7:30now with the black liner we're going to trace underneath the yellow to create an
7:35all-new I shape
7:41leaving the tiny room in between and only go in about this far
7:50yeah
7:52and then for the outer corner kind of pull it out straight and then going in
8:00with a warm brown and smudging this out slightly
8:05all right we finally reached our end destination as far as the I department
8:10goes it's not time for lashes
8:12I'm going to go in with the velocity lashes in Abu Dhabi and these are so
8:18amazing
8:19and yet so I'm gonna probably freak out
8:24all right we've come this far don't give up now it's time to conquer the face
8:31I got a contract today as always using the cabinet quantum medium sculpting
8:35powder and my favorite contouring brush the more feet and 5 30 time to match
8:42those sheeps give it to the haters
8:50we're also going to contour the Jolan because mama de fries yesterday and we
8:57gotta act like we didn't eat fries yesterday and a little trick I've been
9:01doing to make my contour even sharper but still natural and concentrate at the
9:06same time I've been taking my is so Ava 140 lux petite buffer brush and just a
9:13tiny bit of that conference powder and just at the very base of the contour
9:19intensified with that brush you can see how that's like a sunken and now
9:26lightly get it in get it out to blend and see how it made my contour more
9:35intense but not like oh my god
9:39contour where you going with that girl it's it's a girl where you go with a
9:43beautiful contour you know what to say and you can always go back in with your
9:46m44 for brush my morphe that still has your face powder in it and clean up
9:52underneath and can attempt at the edges to stuff it in and look for Less going
9:58to use a sigma or a powder this is in the color coeur de rose that and it's a
10:04very warm salty goodness for the cheeks
10:08so I'm going to use my cuz that number to brush to apply it and chest at some
10:12life to this cheeks
10:15and then a little trick I've been doing lately is grabbing the blush and also
10:22playing it softly on to the chin and I feel like that just adds a little bit
10:30more warmth to the face
10:33whereas if you don't do it it's just like no cheeks no so much life in the
10:37rest of the place is kind of dead like having a step for highlighter and then
10:43we use moonstone by becca and my favorite morphy highlighting brush my
10:47morphe m310 Becky with the good hair wears this is a highlighter and a little
10:58bit on the tip of the nose to show beyoncé when you're in the back of the
11:02audience that you're there
11:04she will see you a little bit on the Cupid's bow and if you really want to go
11:10from it below
11:11grab the time bid right here just in the center of your brows a little bit of
11:18love it
11:18just that sometimes just a tiny and the will make you look goal only for lips

11:26ombre I'm gonna go in with the new two-faced melted matte liquid lipsticks

11:36queen bee of course and this is going mainly on the outer corners
11:45yeah
11:49yeah

11:55and then on the rest of the lip we're going to use me so pretty
12:05like this the perfect ombre new clip now all we need is some setting spray and
12:09i'm going to go in with the Urban Decay all nighter and impure different star

0:42first trailers and I went up and this movie is all about Emily Blunt joining
0:48the cast because she is going to place your least Thrones sister and basically
0:52Emily Blunt is going to bring charlize theron back to life and then the sisters

1:02came along i highly suggest you check in the trailers out i'll put a link down
1:06below where you can see it but yeah go check it out i'm so inspired by this
1:10move a lot with so much and who knows maybe you can wear this look when you go
1:13see this movie
1:14although it's 3d so you'll be wearing glasses and nobody will be there to
1:19appreciate your beauty plus it's dark but hey hey hey it's the thought that
1:24matters
1:25yeah without any further ado if you would like to know how to get this Queen
1:28Ravenna
1:29charlize theron the Huntsman winters war inspired makeup look then please keep
1:35watching
1:36alright guys the first thing we're going to do is moisturize because we want our
1:39skin to look young and radiant I'm gonna go in with my cetaphil moisturizing
1:43cream first
1:46and following through used to make pixi by petra hydrating milky missed give it
1:51a nice little shake and spray
1:54well for foundation today I'm going to go in with the Loreal infallible Pro
1:59matte 24 hour foundation and i'm in the color 101 classic ivory
2:04I'm going to be working it in using my Beauty Blender
2:07for concealer abusing the it cosmetics bye bye under eye and light
2:29yeah
2:30and again blend in using my Beauty Blender
2:35and sometimes after all that blending it can dry up a little bit more so I like
2:40to go back in with that milky more shrines and missed and kind of rhe
2:44dampen it
2:50yeah
2:54and now setting it using mine are soft felt that loose powder and snow like
2:58Snow White and since you don't want this foundation to go anywhere throughout the
3:02day
3:03it's a good idea to now set it with powder and my favorite brush for that is
3:07the morphe m44 for this just packs in that powder like a dream
3:13and for my under-eye cereal like using this makeup geek angled stippling brush
3:17so a combination of these two for powder is amazing and the power I used for like
3:23all three of my face is my mac studio fix in NW 15 and as we get closer
3:28underneath my eyes i mix this with the nurse powder
3:37studded baby right here on the cheeks
3:40I don't mix it with the nurse powder yet but as soon as I hit that like on your
3:44eye area
3:46I know that I should be mixing so I mix the powder on the brush underneath set
3:53and wipe away the baby and for like this spot right here like to take a smaller
3:59brush
4:00this is by sephora and it's the pro press full coverage precision kind of
4:06going on and pack the partner in there because one of my biggest makeup papu's
4:10is when like that side of the nose is all shiny in and I like them sides of
4:16the notes to be Matt as always super thing going in with is of course my mac
4:21software her pain part to keep this look on all day long
4:24people always ask me why I never changed this one up
4:27now it's like it's like oh would you put your child up for adoption when you've
4:33had your child for like five years
4:35no yeah you love it and you won't leave it you know some products are just meant
4:40to stick with you forever
4:42going in with the amazing to face sweet peach palette and going in with the
4:47color white peach within back to 52 i'm just going to start highlighting my brow
4:51and then dragging it down
4:55so really apply this from brow bone to crease and this will make blending later
5:01on extremely easier for the crease of mixing this color right here with
5:06charmed I'm sure
5:08and doing that softly using a mac 224 brush you want to go all the way to
5:16words the inner cruise with this color because it's going to be dramatic and
5:22evil and smoky
5:24so we really want to make an impact here by going all the way to that inner
5:29corner here and also focus on really wanting it onto the outer corner here
5:34and smoking it up and out
5:38I guess that you want this to be super dramatic so don't be afraid
5:45go out make that way and I keep telling you guys
5:49the further you go up the less pressure you want to put on that brush the softer
5:55you apply that shadow once you go higher up the nicer the blend you can you can
6:01like really stamp it in here at the base of the crease with the higher you go up
6:06soft pressure for a really nice applying lino like going back in with that - 52
6:12and white peach and really clean up underneath tape is unnecessary
6:18all you need is in highlight color and brush and clean it up and also let's say
6:24you feel like oh my god just tested some of the eyeshadow and I tasted it it's
6:28just like page
6:29it's amazing you feel like you're blending it a little bit off key you can
6:32always go back in with the brush and kind of soften right at the edge just
6:39really softly
6:41making it a little bit soft and your blended with charmed I'm sure mi is the
6:47wave a 234 I'm darkening my inner and outer thirds for the living to go ahead
6:56and take over the case
6:58gold mine eye shadow which is gorgeous and with a damp mac 242 brush just

0:11it's a very warm tone sexy smoky eye with the glitter pink and silver glitter
0:17and then I wanted to do something different for the lips so not go with
0:21like a typical new door like a dark or like a red so I went from like a

0:54and this is also the reason why on wednesday i didn't have video going up
0:58on monday i got a facial peel and it was with all natural fruit acids and the
1:04girl who did it on me told me you know what you'll be fine your skin will be
1:08renewed and reborn for tonight's video that you're going to film today
1:11basically my skin got all red and then after that it started to peel and get
1:15really dry and patchy - I tried to record this video yesterday and I feel
1:21up to two times and it looks like crap because my under eye area was so dry and
1:26it just looked so wrong but after a day full of masks and moisturizers i'm back
1:32and ready to film this one so i went in with the hola bow super foodies com
1:37cleansing face oil and this is a great product because one it's a cleanser
1:44it's a cleansing oil to get your makeup off with but - if you use the tiny teeny
1:49bit it's great as a serum that degree find it that you have two purposes for
1:53one product and then after i went in with the only moisturizer I know that is
1:57like hardcore and will moisturize a desert and that is the alabi beauty
2:03sleep cream and this is the most hardcore moisturizer I know of
2:07so I packed those
2:08you on this morning and I'm almost surprised and ready to go
2:12today I first want to do some color correction so I'm gonna go in with the
2:15new
2:16Becca backlight targeted color correctors and i'm going to use the
2:20color green for my redness peach for any shadows and going to use the color
2:24violet to perk up my skin so just with a flat foundation brush I pick some of the
2:29product up and just painted my face
2:37yeah
2:43can see how much had already reduced any redness on my faiths so much more
2:49peaceful as you can see the more i applied the violet sort of as a flower
2:58from within the more healthy and just radiant a certain look and last but not
3:06least a little bit of the peach
3:07on my chin area
3:15now with the slightest like the slightest bit of powder you gently want
3:19to press is all over the face to set the color correction and go over top with
3:23the foundation if you do not do this
3:26basically what you're doing is all this color correction work
3:29once you go over with your foundation it will just start dragging the color
3:32correction and you've done everything for nothing

6:15all of this for my lids i'll be going in with this dose of colors ideal duo in
6:21frozen and the top comes with a creamy product so i'll be playing that as a
6:26base and on the bottom it comes with a beautiful pigment and i'll be applying

2:56order to make this look last as long as possible i'm gonna prime using my Mac
3:01soft ochre Paint Pot and applying it using my Sigma 3d HD precision brush
3:07now i'm going to set my Christian brow bone area using a lighter not shade and
3:14this will really help blending later on with makeup geek americano eyeshadow
3:19i'll be cutting my crease and for this it's best to look straight ahead in a
3:23mirror and just place your crease a tiny tad bit above your natural crease like I
3:28did here
3:29it's just right above it and then just follow through by following the natural
3:33curve of your eye and then it's just a little bit more dramatic and the person
3:38using for this is a makeup studio number 22 brush
3:50now mixing americana with Barcelona beach also make up because medics and
3:55with my Cosette p 365 brush i'm just going to start blending that crease that
4:00a little bit more
4:09you want to remember to never go below this line to start to speak this is your
4:15new crease and we're not going to put anything below your new crease because
4:19everything below your new crease is for that beautiful gold now with my Cosette
4:24d 2 20 and Barcelona beach only I start blending even more
4:34yeah
4:39and then with my zoeva - 20 brush and that same color we apply them the crease
4:43and brow bone you can kind of use it as an eraser for the goal i'm going to go
4:47in with this amazing metal pigment by danessa Marik's and it's in the color
4:52Pharaoh and as my mixing medium today to really make it stick
4:55i'll be using the Bionic gel activator by Bionic beauty
5:00so first I apply a layer of bed gel that's a base and remember with this you
5:06can also really clean up the line underneath the cut crease because
5:10someone that pigment up and Pat it on top
5:25now with my morphe e43 brush and the americano only are really going to
5:30concentrate on the base of that new crease for the waterline i'm going to go
5:36in with these two wava graphic eyes in black to earth and with my tweezer men
5:46line glider brush and americano only I'm just gonna bust that in
5:57for the winged liner I'll first be making my outline using the Kat Von D
6:01tattoo liner in trooper now using Sigma's aligning at the legend to
6:10continue the wing
6:14now it's time for some crazy amazing lashes
6:20these are by elevation lashes and these are called ascension number five
6:25after the lower lashes i decided to go a little bit more on the softer side so i
6:30went for the house of lashes precious lashes
6:44ok now that we finish up on these beautiful golden eyes intend to cut
6:48those cheeks and get our contouring on today I'll be contouring used to make
6:52Kevin a quan medium sculpting powder and my morphe and 5 30 brush and remember
6:57this is a draft tutorial but if you want to wear this as a woman
7:03please make the contour as intense and stark as you want and I'm thinking going
7:07to go a little bit more extreme today
7:14yeah
7:17yeah
7:19but i'm also going to do a tiny bit of nose contouring and by tiny I mean a lot
7:31now as you can see this is way too intense so a trick is to grab a bigger
7:35brush and your face powder and just glided over top to stop and the
7:42harshness of it and this will also blended down
7:46it's still has a defining moment now but it's less harsh
7:50this is a trick I picked up from the same and it's amazing
7:53and that's to make it even more intense what you can do is pick your
7:56Beautyblender up with some powder and on top of the edge of the contour line you
8:03created you want to bake and this will make it even more intense but it will
8:11also clean up any shadows you don't want to brush away again and that way you
8:16have a nose contoured that remains very soft but still very effective
8:21I'm going to warm up my face using my to faith milk chocolate bronzer and light
8:25medium and my Cosette number one brush for black going to go in with Max

3:00using Mac's soft brown and applying this using a Mac - 24 really softly just
3:06started to finding your crease with this and i'm using super soft pressure
3:11so this is what you want to remember the more pressure you put on your brush the
3:16harsher and more intense the color will go on
3:20so once i reach this outer portion here I wanted to be super super soft
3:24so that's why I barely put any pressure on my brush to get a nice blend you want
3:30this color to be quite blown out and diffused and the higher i get in that
3:35crease the left
3:37us sure i use now going in with makeup geeks cocoa bear and my favorite Cosette
3:43s 185 brush and just defining the crease a little bit more using this color

1:14especially love this one because it doesn't contain any silicones and
1:18silicones when you put them on the face throughout the day they get a little bit
1:21slippy and they make your makeup run off
1:24they just make up melts and this get a navy a primer spray doesn't have

3:43so we're going to really smoke up that inner crease together that really grungy
3:48feel and to give it that nice the blowout affect the higher you come into
3:53your crease the less pressure you want to apply to your brush
3:57so up here I'm verily touching my skin course we also need some definition on
4:03the outer corner so just start swirling and blending that in and again the
4:09higher you come into that crease the less pressure on your brush once I've
4:15got most of the Colorado like taking that brush really lightly barely
4:19touching the skin and going back and forth to really give it a nice gradient
4:25from makeup geek Manny palette I'm taking this color right here and mixing
4:30it with the red and with these a wave up to 34 that is going on the lid as my
4:34base color now going to take insomnia and going to use this to darken and
4:42smoke everything out and also mention that a little bit with the red color
4:46which is called Mars
4:51to give everything a little bit more of an orange you feel going to take the
4:55middle color which is called sora and really lightly with a morphy mb 23
5:01I'm just blending that in not going to take this color again but this time I'm
5:11going to reapply to the lid with a damp brush
5:23and going back in with the darker colors to blend everything nicely for the lower
5:31lash i'm going to smoke it out using these three colors right here and
5:36putting the color down using a so wave a 240 brush and also all the way to the
5:46inner corners and smooth

0:05Bowl when she sang the national anthem when that camera flew by and I saw a
0:12spark of red which was her suit
0:15I already felt like that was the greatest moment of my life when I saw
0:19that spark of red
0:20I went yes Queen lady gaga killed it
0:24lady gaga was so amazing i was so proud of her and when she blinked and we all
0:29saw that beautiful glittery red lid my Twitter bombarded with tweets asking for
0:35requests and I just died
0:37i drooled a little and today I'm here to do the look for ya
0:41surprisingly enough i think this look is perfect for valentine's day or for like
0:44clubbing on Valentine's Day
0:46it's just a really cool glittery look anyways without any further ado if you
0:51would like to know how to get this lady gaga makeup look right here
0:54then keep watching alright so the first thing you want to do is prime and today
0:59I'm going from my becca backlight priming filter because i want to glow
1:03like a super bowl
1:05national anthem star for my nose and chin i need a little bit more of a prime
1:13for that i'm using the Bekaa ever Mac parlous priming perfect
1:26firm foundation today I'm going to go for a ride or die and make up for ever
1:29ultra foundation sticks because they're my favorite so I'm lasting 120 on the
1:35outer perimeter of my face and 117 on the inner
1:56and with my trusty Beauty Blender I'm going to blend it all in
2:10for concealer I'm going for the cabinet quan central skin enhancer in sx a one
2:16and lightning it a little bit using my krylon TV pin stick in
2:2100
2:28and again blaming that in using my Beauty Blender and i'm going to bake
2:41using mine are soft velvet loose powder in snow
2:56i'm priming my eyelids using Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
3:04work max of vanilla eyeshadow i'm just setting my crease of Robin area to get a
3:10completely met and easier to blend later on we need a little bit of transition in
3:16that crease so first i'm going in with makeup cosmetics peach smoothie and
3:21softly blending this into the crease using a mac 224 brush
3:38now for some depth of hiding Showtime also by making because medals to the lid
3:42and the crease and I'm first using this naked studio number 17 brush to lay the
3:48color down
4:00and with a Cosette d 2 20 brush I'm just softly blending it into the crease
4:20and with these a waiver to 40 brush i'm also applying it to the lower lash I
4:24know about halfway in for the inner corner i'm highlighting with a mixture
4:34of max think pink and nylon eyeshadow and applying this using the light
4:40portion of my cavity shade + light eye brush
4:46ok now comes the fun part but also the hardest part
4:50the glitter and what I did was just go a little bit above my natural crease and I
4:55did give it a little bit of a shape at the outer corner just to lift the I a
4:59little bit more a trick is when you're not doing this on camera
5:02lean forward with your face while looking down and then pack that glitter
5:07on and that way you will have the least amount of fallout as an adhesive today
5:11i'll be using the lit clearly liquid glitter base and the Glitter i'll be
5:15using it's also by lit and this is firecracker number for the first laying
5:20that bass down and going right over top with the glitter
5:36and if you feel like the glitter is not fully opaque there's this amazing
5:44pigment by illamasqua called berber and i'll use that to fill up any holes can
5:54always use a fan to dry the glitter a little bit quicker so you will not get
5:59any creases in it
6:00now all you want to do is finish off with some lashes and i'm using the hood
6:05of beauty Maryland the goggles cheeks looked very sculpted and glowy and
6:17supernatural flushed so wrong so I'm going to contract today using my cabinet
6:24one sculpting cutter in medium and my morphe and 5 30 brush going to do a
6:38little quick with of baking

7:02my favorite also highlighting the tip of my nose & mckellips ball
7:15Oh cute
7:20and for watched a little bit of mac speeches and cause that number to brush
7:27and spring a little bit of makeup forever missed em fix to set this entire
7:41shebang
7:42all right for lips going to go for something nude and flattering because
7:51there's so much going on in here in this portion of the face
7:55so you want to keep this portion of the face a little bit more wearable
7:59I hate that word no kidding that suffers are going in with a mac lipstick called
8:04kinda sexy and I'm aiming to words more of the outer parts of my lips and going
8:10in with a lighter color after
8:20alright so kind of sexy is on and now you want to go in with a lighter color
8:24and for me that will be a myth
8:27my mac and now you can wear a gloss over top of but I feel like God's lips were a
8:35little bit more shiny vs glossy so I'm perfectly fine with this and that guy's

0:09a cabal BAM lip but as i was recording this video and i did my eyes and I
0:15applied the lashes out of nowhere
0:17glitter came around the corner you know glitter is always near when I'm around
0:21let's be honest so out of nowhere I applied silver glitter to my lower lash
0:26line
0:26I kind of started living for that by the time I had to do my kebab am bright lip
0:31I was like no I'm not in the mood to do a command right now live right now so
0:35out came this very soft and Nikki terms
0:40angelic glitter lashes she knew d look see the previous two episodes of winter

1:09if you want to know how to get this makeup look right here then keep on
1:12watching and so of course we're going for that flawless finish today and
1:17instead of always going for my nivea men after shave long today I'm going to mix
1:21things up a little bit and show you different options
1:24so the first product and going in with is by marc jacobs and this is the
1:28invisible undercover perfecting coconut primer and what I personally love about
1:37this primer is that it feels a little bit more thick and you really feel it
1:41hydrating your skin and therefore it makes it perfect for drier skin and just
1:46really gives it that lecture skill to apply makeup to to minimize the
1:51appearance of my pores and then go in with this tart clean slate primer
1:55I'm going to tap this into my skin because after watching the purposes of
2:00all morning and she loves this stuff and she told me to pat
2:06this in instead of smearing it
2:09I'm follow you boo since my skin is going to be such a huge feature of this
2:13look I wanted to be flawless
2:15so I love changing things up just not the sticks so i'm going to go back into
2:19my makeup forever alter HD foundation sticks
2:22I love them ride or die and that is what i'll be using to achieve a flawless face
2:28so again folks outer perimeter 120 inner 117
2:43london using your beauty blender
3:00for concealer i'll use another writer die it cosmetics bye bye under eye in
3:05light and like I said skin will be such a big feature of this look so go ahead
3:09and highlight with that concealer and really get it to an A plus plus
3:21yeah
3:27yeah
3:29so really now also using it as a highlighter and again you know it
3:37so I want to do everything first and then my eyes
3:41last I don't know why but it works for me
3:49yeah
3:56yeah
3:59so from the lowest point of where you apply the concealer work your way up
4:05towards your eye and I really buff it in
4:13now what is that you're under is using powder to prevent it from creasing we
4:17call it
4:18baking
4:28and then I also like to bake the sides of my nose because I get shiny there and
4:36like 1.2 seconds so mama needs the bank

4:46I'm going to do right now off camera
4:48ok so that I look is super minimal but we still wanted to look flawless
4:52so first I'm gonna prime using with software group in part by mac and for
4:55this amusing a sigma 3d HD precision brush now i'll be taking the lightest
5:02shade from the urban decay naked smoky palette and that is called 13 and what
5:07days away about 220 brush
5:08I'm just gonna buff that all over my crease and brow bone area

6:30roots of my lashes and for lashes i'll be using these true beauties right here
6:42these are ahead of beauty and they are called Raquel
6:52and then really lift him using your fingers by pushing up the base of the
6:57lash and then the front and a push straight board so it doesn't go up as
7:01much because i like these clashes better when the front is more straight out
7:06words and the outer corners more up to get there really nice with my Urban

0:31yeah i just hope you enjoy and without any further ado let's go on to the
0:35tutorial so it's Christmas and you want your makeup to last all day long and so
0:42the first thing I'm going to do is prime
0:44I got a prime using nivea men after shave balm insensitive
0:48ok I haven't said this in a long time so here we go this contains glycerin at the
0:53second most used ingredients and glycerin makes products stick to it
0:58so when you use this as a base the makeup will really stick on to it making
1:03it last all day long I've been a fan of this for forever now and I've got so
1:07many people to use this
1:09and trust me this works and the goals that you only take a little bit and
1:14start buffing it into the skin and you want to keep puffing until it starts
1:19feeling Jackie
1:20so you'll feel it be really liquidy when you first apply it but then once you
1:24start smoothing and in for like a minute it becomes tacky
1:28that is what you want so for me right now is really tacky and that is perfect
1:34also can we say hi to the space troll I have right here
1:37why I want that flawless finish is so for foundation today I'm going to go for
1:42my favorite makeup forever foundation ultra HD sticks
1:46i apply 122 the outer perimeter of my face and 117 to the inner
1:5417
2:07and then with the Beauty Blender i'm going to start bouncing this in
2:19then for concealer it cosmetics bye bye under eye in light my favorite
2:28and again london using your beauty blender
2:39and then setting everything with powder to prevent it from creasing the first
2:45thing i'll be applying to my eyes is my mac suffer great pain pop to prevent my
2:48eyes from creasing and i'm applying this using a sigma 3d HD precision brush now
2:56to help blending i'm going to set my crease the brow bone area using a match
3:00new Chado going into these you a ready-to-wear were solid I'm taking the
3:06color
3:06sahara and with an honest hacer Beverly Hills blending brush i'm applying that
3:10to the crease all you want to do with this is just give your eyes some
3:18definition because later on once the wing is on we're going to go back in
3:23with a darker color and really intensify that i'm just giving myself a guideline
3:28here now I'm applying makeup geeks peach smoothie
3:31and with that same Anasazi Beverly Hills brush go ahead and buff out that crease
3:36and this was especially help get that beautiful flawless blend and a little
3:42bit of warm for my little first applying a tiny bit of this color pop gel liner
3:47and this is in the color exit and we're going to use this as a base to really
3:51make that live
3:51pop
3:57and immediately right after go in with a match cream color and said it
4:05i'm also applying that mac cream color to my inner corners to open them up now
4:12for the fun part the lower lash line first we're going to start off with
4:16eyeliner applying a point to be very intercourse here to extend the eye and
4:21from there we can create a liner and from there we can create a whole new I
4:25shape and from the tip of the winged dragon back onto the lash line now
4:37connect the extended inner corner to the wing and you've got yourself an outline
4:42now of course you have to feel this all in
4:46and for this I'm using my Sigma legend line ace
4:49now with that seems you a color i applied to the crease you want to create
4:53a line parallel to the eyeliner we just created and dislocate a new inner corner
4:59i'm going to give them more depth and strength using a medium brown matte
5:05eyeshadow

5:11i'll be using my Sigma 1 this is the line 8 in endorse and to open up my eyes
5:21even more i'm applying a white liner to my waterline
5:24this is the same one by color pop it's the same color exit but it's in a pencil
5:29form

0:37selena gomez inspired makeup look
0:39then people watching as always the first thing i'll be doing is priming my
0:43eyelids and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this and i'm applying this
0:47using a sigma 3d HD precision brush them with a light cream colored eyeshadow i'm
0:54setting my crease and brow bone area and this will help me blend the shadows i
0:59put in the crease a lot easier for my crease I'll going with the Urban Decay
1:03blush in video and makeup geeks cherry cola shadow and with a more fee and 505
1:10I'm first blending this into my crease but mainly on the outer part and winging
1:14it out
1:26then with a zueva - 20 brush
1:29I just softly blend the edges now with cherry cola only and that same brush
1:36start building up definition going in with Max a little lusty blush and visit
1:44the exact red tone that Selena had on her outer crease and increase so i'm
1:48going to apply that to the outer and inner crease and i'm using a more fiji
1:5317 for this and this we can just make everything a little teensy bit more
1:58bright for the latter first going in with Captain D's metal crush eyeshadow
2:03in raw power and i'm applying this with a mac 239
2:11following through with this next prismatic eyeshadow in fireball
2:25every pop of peach i'm using this - I'll see every Hills illuminator in peach
2:30nectar and with these a wave at 234 that is going on the inner third of the lid
2:35for your lower lash line and going back in with fireball by nicks and then with
2:45that mac blush and a sigma e 15 i'm just adding more red to the lower lash line
2:51now i'm going to apply the Urban Decay 24-7 waterline pencil in legend to my
2:58waterline and now directly to the roots of the lashes apply some black shadow
3:06now it's time for the beautiful smoky liner so first going in with my captain
3:13d in kleiner in trooper to make my lines and then fill in using my signal line
3:18aids in legend
3:32yeah
3:42once you've got that line now you want to grab these the wave of 322 and smoke
3:47it out with black eyeshadow
3:52I want to do now is finish the look off with some lashes and these are hood of
3:56beauty
3:57Audrey and a little trick I always do to get the inner corners lifted is I come
4:07with a tweezer from above and kinda bend them straight up so I just go to that
4:15route and stick it straight up kind of lifted
4:25and they would also helps us just with your finger to push at them so they lift
4:32up
4:34I'm for cheeks Selena didn't really have much going on on the apples of her
4:39cheeks with mostly contour and warmed up with a blush and lots of glow so further
4:45that bronze up my face using this to face and was summer 16 hour long wear
4:50bronzer the blush i'll be using for this is a more fee and 527 just lightly
4:58contour and bronze up your face with this bronzer or any bronze you may have
5:05I love this bronzer so much
5:08it's not too orange is not too yellow
5:13not too dirty and then what I always like to do is take a big fluffy brush
5:16and just about everything and even more so it's traceless and blend it in and
5:23just look good there for a highlighter today I'm going to go in with
5:26unnecessarily hills the Starlight illuminator and i'm using a sigma hi
5:32cheekbone highlighter fo3 brush for this and then also highlight the tip of my
5:44nose the bridge of the nose and my Cupid's bow and therefore blushing and
5:54we use urban decay's blush in video again the same that went into the crease
5:58and I'm just taking a little bit because the Urban Decay blushes are super
6:02pigmented and a sigma s 37 brush which I really love for blush lately and from
6:09the contour kind of go up to the highlight and kind of diffuse everything
6:17together but don't really come forward to the apple of the cheek because solita
6:24definitely didn't have anything
6:26they're just keep it on the side like a slob bitch
6:30look at that hole now i'm going to do to finish this off is spray my face using
6:34the skin and Naevia make a finishing spray i love this one
6:39get rid of the powder look for lips are going to use this urban decay liner in
6:44naked Urban Decay Naked lip liner and this is the exact color I'm looking
6:55first i'm also going to fill in the entire lip with this
7:06and then only in the center a little bit of melted sugar by two phase
7:17and then finish off with the gloss and the glass i'll be using is my current
7:20favorite by Sigma this is the lip eclipse in seal over poofles and that's

3:08that is what you want to follow that gives it that really classic vintage
3:11touch

4:10I'm going to slightly cut the crease with this
4:13so with my makeup geek defined crease brush
4:16I'm looking straight forward and applying the shadow right above my
4:21crease so that when I look straight forward can still see it and then at the
4:26outer portion want to softly wing it out then from the outer corner

0:14hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial on the black smokey look that demi
0:18lovato was wearing in her new music video
0:21cool for the summer which in my opinion is these summer anthem of 2015 the
0:27entire music video is so sexy and I was makeup is on . and i think she's never
0:32looked better
0:34so that is the look that I'm doing for you today if you would like to know how
0:36to get this
0:37demi lovato black smokey eyes makeup look and keep watching
0:41so the first thing i'll be doing of course is priming and today i will not
0:45be going in with my aftershave balm nivea I'm actually a little bit more dry
0:49today
0:50and when I'm a little bit more dry i like going for the set of Phil and this
0:54is the hydration low shown a subscriber here on my channel recommended this to
1:00me if you have dry skin this also has glycerin as it's the second ingredient
1:06and glycerin make stuff stick to it
1:08so if you use this as your base your makeup will really stick onto the
1:11cluster in making it stay on all day
1:13so instead of my aftershave balm i'm going to use this because I'm a little
1:17bit more try
1:18just as with the aftershave balm I do like to follow through with my smashbox
1:22primer water for foundation today I'm going to go in with my born this way
1:26foundation by to face and this is in the color ivory and of course I cannot go
1:31without my dearest cojiendo on confirmation in 213
1:35so i'll be making a mixture of these two right here and that will be my
1:39foundation and i'm applying this using my morphe e6 brush
1:55for my concealer and first going to correct so let me use my mac studio
2:01finish correct and conceal in pale pink and pale yellow
2:15and then going over top with my urban decay naked skin concealer in fair
2:21neutral and working that in with a real techniques bunch
2:38and setting that with powder to prevent everything from creasing so for the eyes
2:44the first thing you want to do is prime them
2:46of course because we're going to work with black eye shadows and that is one
2:50of the hardest looks to do and for this we're going to use my mac software paint
2:54pot and i'm applying it with a days away by 142 concealer buffer brush then to
3:01make the blending and decreased way easier and i'm going to take this Bobby
3:04Brown ivory eyeshadow and i'm setting the softer could paint pot from my
3:08crease up to my brow bone and this will just help blend all the eyeshadows that
3:13we put over top way easier as you may have noticed i still have some powder
3:18underneath my eyes and I'm doing this so that would ever dark color falls down as
3:23fallout
3:23I can brush away right after so this way you will not have any fallout at the end
3:28of the look for my crease that first going in with these two shades from the
3:32morphe 35o and palate and with a morphy m 4 12 I'm just blending that in and for
3:42a black smokey eye look it's extremely important to have a blending transition
3:47color in your crease because if you don't lending will become so harsh and
3:52so unattractive it will become so wrong
3:57so having that blending transition color in the crease will really make this look
4:01a lot more wearable and easy to do
4:04from that same palette of mixing these two colors right here and this is also
4:08going in the crease just to darken it up and with ajax beauty line number 7 brush
4:13I'm just buffing that in
4:19yeah
4:21and to really blend those edges just take that first brush you used with the
4:25first to blending shades and just wiggle back and forth between the lines and it
4:30will soften it and blend it out for Matt late i'm going to use the Tasha de known
4:35as blackest black matte eyeshadow and I'm going to pack this on using a mac
4:39242 and with a makeup geek defined crease brush
4:48I'm just blending the edges into the brown
4:55once you're done doing the top portion you can take away all this powder and
4:59remove the fall out for a bit lower lash line and again going in with that
5:03Natasha didn't own a black is black eyeshadow and I'm just smoking the black
5:07into the roots of my lower lashes then with my Mac - 13 in a soft brown color
5:18I'm just blending and smoking that out and then for some shine on the inner
5:22corners of taking this color pop
5:24liberty is super shadow
5:33to finish off going to apply some mascara and false ease and the policies
5:37of using today are by her beauty and these are the main clashes in Naomi p
5:50yeah
5:54ok for cheeks i think it's an understatement when I say Demi was glowy
5:59and bronzy like her makeup artist went all out on the cheeks
6:04so first I'm going to warm up my skin because I definitely need a lot of
6:07bronzer to mimic her bronze venus
6:10so I'm gonna mix - I'm going to use the tart park at princess bronzer right here
6:15and then to warm it up a little bit more
6:18my give me some more light skin finish my mac draw a line
6:29groans adult and of course around the hairline then to contour i'm going to
6:38use a bobby brown eyeshadow this is weeks and this is a New Found Love
6:43Actually this is great
6:45so with miles away but luxe highlight brush and just carving up my cheeks for
6:54blessing to use melodia Luminoso and for this amusing a is the wave looks cheek
6:59finished brush now you want to go all out with the highlighting we're gonna go

7:14favorite highlighting brush i am going to go and highlight my cheekbones first
7:19now with Demi you could clearly see that when she smiled
7:25it was also on the apple of her cheek so give yourself a little small and ding
7:29ding ding ding
7:31just a tiny bit we're also going to highlight the brow bone with this above
7:39the arch of your brow then also of course your Cupid's bow and then also
7:44those two lines going up to your nose

0:27bitch better have my money i love this music video because rihanna is just
0:32patch it crazy in it and I i love that
0:34so I decided to recreate the look where she is about to cut murder the man she
0:43grabs his knife that looks at it all fiercely and then she's about to cut
0:47someone that is the look that I'm doing plus i'm also collaborating with shan XO
0:52Shannon here I knew too and she is recreating the library Anna is wearing
0:56the purple blue lips and the eyeliner that scene cuts by really fast but the
1:01look is gorgeous they definitely don't forget to check out Shannon's but i'll

1:15you would like to know how to get this Rhiana bitch better have my money make a
1:19book then keep watching
1:21alright so the first thing i'll be doing is priming my face so that my face stays
1:25intact all day long and for this I'm using my nivea men after shave balm
1:30insensitive
1:31now if you're new to my channel you're like what
1:34so this aftershave balm contains a lot of glycerin and glycerin makes products
1:39stick to it
1:41so if you apply this is your base the glycerin in this will keep your makeup
1:45on all day and after working it in for a while you will feel becoming tacky and
1:52then it's what you want
1:53after that I like to follow through with my smashbox primer water for foundation
1:58I'm using this kogan dell'acqua foundation into 13 and mixing it a
2:03little bit with the Kogan dough and moisture foundation in 20 12 and to
2:10apply it i'm using my morphe e6 brush
2:16you want to apply this in a nice stippling motion
2:28for concealer and we use the urban decay naked skin concealer in fair neutral and
2:34first just underneath my eyes and then go crazy and applied wherever you think
2:40you need it
2:42war paint and then with my Real Techniques sponge and blending that in
3:00then setting up with powder to prevent it from creasing the first thing i'll be
3:06doing is applying a base to my list to prevent everything from creasing and for
3:11this I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and i'm using is away the concealer
3:15buffer brush for this
3:16the first I should i'm going to go in with is by understand early hills and
3:21this called orange soda and this color will act as our transition for inner
3:25crease and amusing a morphy em 5044 this as the main color i'll be using love +
3:34by sugarpill and with a morph em5 13
3:38i'm just applying that to the crease
3:48and I'm barely touching my skin with the brush and because of that you will get a
3:54really nice blend on its own
3:57of course it will need some more blending later on but just slightly
4:01touching the skin it will do most of the work for you then here on the outer
4:06corner you want to wing it out a little bit
4:08you can always go back in with the orange soda and diffuse the edges
4:16i'm also concentrating the red on the outer portion of my lid
4:22now for the lid i'm going to use the max new dazzle shadow in
4:28let's roll because the shadows are kind of hard to work with as a base

4:37glitter base and we use this as a base of the shadow over top and that will
4:41really make it pop

4:57darkening the corners and the crease

0:49so yeah that's it if you want to know how to get this makeup look right here
0:53then please keep watching
0:55so the first thing we'll be doing is applying a base to my eyelids to prevent

1:38de Nona eyeshadow palette in number nine and i'm taking this color right here and
1:43this is called industrial and with a more fiemme 422 i'm just applying this
1:48all over the lid and then dampening that brush and then using the same eyeshadow
1:57but damp and what that will do is just intensify the sheen and metallic miss of
2:04that shadow even more for the lower lash line i'm going in with that same dark
2:09warm brown from the more few palette and with a morphy mb 18 brush just defining
2:16my lower lash line and smoking it out and then for the inner portion of the

2:45inner corners I'm again taking that Natasha danone eyeshadow palette and

2:58liner and we use this amazing new liner that i got from pure minerals and this

0:21today I'm doing a tutorial on this warm toned smokey eye look I was super
0:25inspired because next monday here in holland it is kings day
0:30therefore the orange background this is sort of an homage to my duchies I've
0:35done a couple of kings and queens day tutorials in the past before but this
0:40year I wanted to make it super wearable and sexy and smoky and appropriate for
0:45mine under she's also because i want everyone to be able to do warm tone
0:49smokey eyes see if without any further ado if you want to know how to get these
0:53warm tone smokey eyes perfect for kings day as well then please keep watching
0:59so the first thing I'm doing is always is applying a base to my limits to
1:02prevent everything from creasing and for this obvious my mac soft ochre Paint Pot
1:07the first action i'll be using today is cocoa bear by makeup geek I'm just
1:14starting off by softly placing this into my crease kind of push it in there and
1:23wiggle around and then once it's on start blending and diffusing that out
1:30now i'm taking makeup geeks peach smoothie and mixing this in with cocoa
1:38bear and with that mixture you're dragging the crease more towards the
1:43inner part of your crease so this is outer part this is inner part so with a
1:49softer shade of warm brown we're going on the inside of the crease now with
1:58peach smoothie only i'm going to soften the edges just lightly now taking the
2:07unassessably hills artists palette and taking this color right here or into
2:11fancy and that color is going onto the inner third of my eyelid
2:20i'm also placing this right here sort of the outer third of my lid for the center
2:31i'll be using this makeup geek fold eyeshadow in in the spotlight and blend
2:41it with the orange for the lower lash time we're basically mimicking what we
2:46did on top so I'm first going in with cocoa bear by makeup geek and applying
2:51this to my outer corners then also high in colbert on the inner corners and
3:04putting in the spotlight right in the center and with orange you fancy i'm
3:11going right in between the two for my eyeliner today I'm using a necessity
3:18briefly hills a liquid lipstick in vamp and the liquid lipsticks by on the cyber
3:22bully Hills actually make the best liquid eyeliners and I personally will
3:31be doing the wing for this look but if you feel like doing the wing then do it
3:35to bring back a little bit of that orange element I'm taking another liquid
3:39lipstick by on says Beverly Hills this is persimmon and mixing it with vamp and
3:45that together we will create a really warm warm brown and that is going right
3:49on the center of the eyeliner
3:56to open up my eyes and using a little bit of mix milk eyepencil doing this
4:01off-camera and all you want to do now to finish is apply mascara and false ease
4:05and falses i'll be using rvs by house of lashes these are called the temptress
4:10lashes for cheeks i'm going to highlight using my Keaveney shade and light
4:17pellets
4:24the Browns my skin i'm using this L'Oreal glam bronze in number one
4:39for blush I'm using Mac speeches
4:48then to highlight our first going in with Rebecca press shimmering skin
4:52Perfector in rose gold in a bigger brush and this is going to act as a glow all
4:57over and then with moonstone later on and really going to intensify everything
5:01so taking a little bit of rose gold and popping that on the tops of the cheeks
5:07nose just everywhere really
5:13and as I said with moonstone only i'm really going to highlight
5:27and that's safe for the cheeks or lips I want to go for nude and Matt so the
5:32first liquid lipstick i'll be using is my honest as early Hills this is called
5:36pure Hollywood
5:53and then on the center i'll be applying milkshake
6:05yeah
6:10and that guy's concludes my warm tone smokey eye makeup tutorial which fits

0:16hey guys so today i'll be doing a tutorial on Jennifer Lopez's performance
0:21on american idol from her new single field the lights
0:24Jennifer looked like a goddess no she looked like a twink Ling dazzling
0:30goddess fairy itself up
0:34no words i was absolutely dying overlooked it was so sparkly
0:39so intensely gorgeous i I just knew I had to recreate it for you see I without
0:45any further ado if you want to know how to get the sparkly JLo look right here
0:49then please keep on watching
0:51alright guys so I already went ahead ended my foundation concealer browse and
0:54all that stuff and it also already applied a base to my eyelids to prevent
0:58everything from creasing now onto the first I shadow this is by understand
1:02perfectly hills this is called bone and I find blue eye shadows to be one of the
1:08hardest colors to blend so little trick is to take a light colored eyeshadow a
1:13new tone and brush it all over your eyelids and that will make blending
1:18easier so just with bone just going all over my eyes now for the blue and the
1:29crazy i'll be using two eyeshadows the first one is by officers roughly hills
1:33this is called star blue and also be using this fold eyeshadow by makeup geek
1:37and this is called center stage now really slowly start blending these two
1:43colors into your crease now again I find blue to be one of the hardest colors to
1:50work with so you want to go little by little
1:53don't rush yourself take all the time you need for blending I want to keep the
1:57artery edge more of a rounded shape as opposed to a more angular and wing shape
2:03so I'm just going to keep it soft and follow the curves of my crease a little
2:07by little star working your way into the inner part of your crease just really
2:16smoothly and lightly blend that in take your time then to make the blend a
2:22little bit smoother going to go in with another on the says Beverly Hills
2:25eyeshadow this is called stone with the center stage only
2:29to intensify the blue a little bit for the lid i'll also be making a mixture of
2:36to us directly hills eyeshadows the first one is gold rush and the second
2:41one is suede and as I said this is just going onto the lid blending into the
2:48blue
2:58alright then for the lower lash line and again taking center stage and that is
3:02going from the outer corner to about half way in then because I don't want to
3:13make the lower lash line to stark into cool toned and bringing in some warmth
3:18using this eyeshadow by makeup geek this is called latte
3:28I'm taking center stage again and going over top
3:34all right now it's time for that insane sparkle i'm going to take this makeup
3:40studio jewel effect in sparkle and literally i'm going to dust this all
3:45over my eyeballs and not just on the eyelids everywhere
3:59therefore even more shine and sparkle makeup videos jewel sex and shine and
4:04this is going on the inner corners and the brow bone
4:13I'm going to line my waterline using Mac's pression I'm cutting this out
4:16because students in camera is unfortunately ugly and all you want to
4:20do now is eyeliner and we're first going to create a little tiny point on the
4:25inner corner to elongate the eyes and then follow along the lashline and no
4:30wing
4:40all going to do now is apply mascara and false lashes and then we'll be back
4:45right for cheeks first we need a little bit of contouring and for that I'll be
4:49using my own desk eyeshadow in heroin into further warm up my face and taking
5:01this birch wob what's called Matt illusion bronzing powder in number 21
5:18for watching just going to use the Luminoso by Milani just because it fits
5:22every look you could ever imagine so it if it's this now for highlighting you
5:33want to go for the extreme you want to go to the max because Jennifer had the
5:38same sparkles that she had on her eyes also applied to the tops of my

0:22differently
0:25I was inspired by <operand> two </operand> into your fears of the latest
0:28episode of RuPaul's track race so this is what I came up with I think this is
0:32so much fun for like a a grungy party or for like a a glossy glam party or just
0:39for when you want to look glam but dark and different and I i I'm really
0:44enjoying this look
0:45yeah without any flavor it do if you want to know how to get this glittery
0:49grungy glamour me look right here then please stay tuned
0:54all right the first thing is always is priming and putting a base on the
0:59eyelids to prevent everything from creasing to prevent your eyeshadow from
1:03doing exactly this what you're seeing right now
1:07so for this i'm taking my mac soft ochre Paint Pot and this is going from lashes
1:12two brow-bone the first color and my crease will be an eyeshadow by Anasazi
1:20beverly hills and this is fun
1:22I'm just picking up a little bit of it and going directly on the outer part of
1:27my crease right here
1:29so really softly push that in to your crease is our blending and diffusing out
1:40I'm personally going for a very rounded I shape today so just follow the curves
1:47of your crease be next I shadow is also by honest I beverly hills and this is
1:54called stone and with this i'm just going to blow out that crease color a
1:58tiny bit more so just with windshield wiper motions and a fluffy blending
2:04brush just a fuse and soften the edges that are really deep in the outer part
2:12of the crease and taking rich brown eyeshadow by Anasazi berkeley hills
2:18you want to start of so little and with the tiniest amount of product possible
2:25to prevent any far from happening
2:29Plus to make the blend really seamless and nice so just with a tiny amount of
2:34product star deepening those outer corners for the lower lash line again
2:42going in fun and with this you're really going to map out which look you want to
2:48give your under eye area so i tried to go for this like super smoky intense
2:53lower lash line we can keep it small and concentrated also but i'm going for
2:58blended and smoky
3:00so with Sean really determined that shape they using rich brown
3:08I'm really adding a lot of drama for the lid
3:13i'll be using this grimace Polly glitter in number 75 and the tiniest bit of Max
3:18glitter and gold
3:25and I just spending it with the piece of paper to prevent it from creasing for
3:32just the fun twist I'm again extending the inner corners just very nice
3:37seductive feel all you want to do now is apply some falsies and the eyes are done
3:46so for falsies today i'll be using iconic by house of lashes and as you can
3:57see once you put the lashes on it creates a little tiny gap here you want
4:00to fill that in with a little bit of black eyeshadow and to seal the deal

7:49one
0:22hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial on the look I was wearing in my March
0:27hits and Oh God knows you guys my bar to me with requests for that look so today
0:32i am here doing it for you
0:34it's a very monotone earthy brown toned makeup look with this super-intense cat
0:40eyeliner and just the lips and just the everything it's super glam yet still
0:44edgy and different and monotone so monotone cat eyes see without any
0:52further ado if you want to know how to get this look right here then keep on
0:55watching
0:57so I already went ahead and did my base foundation so I used my foundation
1:01concealer did browse all that it's now time to do the first thing for the eyes
1:06I'm first putting down a base
1:08I'm taking my mac software could paint pot and this will prevent everything
1:11from creasing now i'm just taking a light-colored matte eyeshadow and with a
1:21big fluffy blending brush
1:23this is going all over and this will help make blending easier
1:27the first I shall be using is a fun by unsaved early Hills
1:32no no what are you doing and really simply i'm defining my crease with this
1:40and you can go for a winged eye shape on the outer edge you can go round it i'm
1:46just following the natural curves and hugging the natural curves of Mike
1:50wreath
1:55yeah
2:02then with a big fluffy blending brush and still using fun
2:06I'm just blending that out even more making it look seamless for the lower
2:10lash line I'm again taking fun and what people seem to love so much is that the
2:15lower lash line was very smoky and champion dark
2:19so go ahead and blend this as far down as you like now going in on assessing
2:27briefly Hilson smoke
2:29eyeshadow and just deepening that outer corner for the little using makeup geeks
2:38foiled eyeshadow in grandstand first applying the majority of it with my
2:43finger
2:44I feel like I get most coverage using my fingers and then perfecting with a brush
2:50now it's time for the key feature of this look
2:58the cat eyeliner so I'm first going in with my cavity tattoo liner in trooper
3:02just to make my outline and i'll fill in is in my NYC black liquid liner just
3:08because i love sort of mapping out the shape with captain d and I like the
3:13madness and the opaqueness of the NYC one and that is why use that to fill it
3:18in
3:18then from that long you want to drag it back onto your lid as close to the inner
3:26corner as you can then what I like to do next is focused on that cat flick
3:34so I just place the cavity tattoo liner in my like it might tear duct area like
3:40directly into my i drag it out and that creates a line and from there you can
3:45finish the whole thing off
3:51from here you can drag this side back into the eye and from here you connected
3:57to the eyeliner so once you've got the outline all you want to do is fill in
4:09between the lines
4:19ok from there to give the crease a little bit more of a cut feel like a cup
4:23crease
4:24I'm taking on the says he readily hills smoke again and because i want to warm
4:28the shade a little bit up because I feel like it's a little bit too ashy for a
4:32look
4:33I'm mixing it with a little bit of caramel and then that shade is going
4:38right into the crease from that wing you want to bring it into the crease all the
4:46way to the inner corner like a cut crease and blend it out softly that way
4:53you give your crease a little bit more definition and define meant without
4:59actually cutting your crease
5:01once you've got that you're done all you want to do now is the PI mascara and
5:05just some false lashes today I'll be isn't build these are the pixi luck by
5:10house of lashes but first mascara
5:30all right onto cheeks the first thing i'll be doing is giving myself a lovely
5:34contour using in Damascus eyeshadow in heroin
5:46then to bronze up my skin and taking this mineralized skin finish by Mac
5:50called give me son
5:52and just from the contour but that in to your cheeks are blush luminosa milani
6:09and for highlighter I'm of course using becasue burning skin Perfector pressed
6:14in moonstone and the glow goes right here on the highest parts of your
6:21cheekbones blending down into the the ball in that little dent of the nose

0:04glowy flashy nude free hair just go natural today I felt like doing this
0:12super wearable easy to do
0:14natural makeup look that super glowy and I think very flattering plus i also

0:30sure you please stay tuned and if you want to know how to get this then please
0:36stay tuned
0:37alright so to get myself started today I'm first going in with the dior glow
0:41maximizer and it's just an illuminating base and that is exactly what i want for
0:46this look because i want to go no no I can
0:48angel oh dear oh that's a globe now for foundation I thought really long and
0:54hard on this and this look today is more of a soft look but still I want my base
1:00to look on fleek and gotten a lot of comments that my basis sometimes too
1:05perfect
1:06but you know what I'd rather have my base looking perfect then not so perfect
1:11so today I'm going to make a mixture of my benefit hello flawless foundation in
1:16pure for sure ivory and just to give it a little bit more fish
1:19I'm going to take the cross island TV pin sick in g 191
1:23so first i'm going in with the benefit foundation and then wherever I need more
1:27i apply the cryo and TV paint stick
1:41there now go ahead and highlight today I'm going to use my mac pro longwear in
1:45NC 15 and my crew on TV pin stick in 4062 highlights but if you feel like a
1:52lot of foundation + concealer is too much for you then by all means
1:57skip that do you you do you I'm going to do me
2:13and now quickly setting everything with powder so it will increase
2:20so now i'm going to quickly do my brows and one I off camera and that it will be
2:27back
2:28okay so four eyes were going to keep this very easy quick and simple and
2:32silly little glamorous and last year so it's always the first thing I'm doing is
2:36priming my eyelids to prevent any creasing from happening
2:40and for this I'm using my software group in part by Mac them from my tartare
2:44lapel and i'm going to take this color right here and I'm applying the shade of
2:48right into my crease and up to my brow bone and what this will do is it will
2:53help blend out the crease color that will place on later it will help let
2:59those out easier and smoother
3:01so from the same palette i'm going to go into wonderer and with this i'm just
3:05going to start defining the outer parts of my crease a little bit more just to
3:09get more definition and depth so ride into the crease focus applying wonderer
3:18and bring it in about half way in now my eye shape greatly benefits from a
3:25rounded outer corner but if your eyes benefit from a v-shaped outer corner
3:31by all means do that so I'm going to drag the brown on to my outer corner and
3:38rounded out then picking up a little bit more of wonder on a big blending brush
3:47we're just going to diffuse and blend out this define - because it's
3:53definitely way too harsh now and we wanted to be soft and hazy for the
3:58living room using color pops XO super shock shadow and for some extra glam
4:07over top i'm applying the the bomb overshadow whatever in and no money no
4:12honey it's a pigment and
4:14right over top XO just for some extra glam and shine
4:20I don't wanna go too far with the lower lash line so again taking that crease
4:24color and really slightly defining the roots of my lower lashes and then to
4:33open up the eyes and devise a wide awake feel I'm taking my bed nine neutralizer
4:38cream crayon and that is going on the waterline
4:41all right to finish up the eyes all you need is some mascara on your top lashes
4:45only if you prefer mascara on your bottom lashes also that
4:48by all means go ahead and do that I find that my eyes look more natural without
4:53anything on the lower lashes so going to do that and falsies
4:58I wanted to be super lash e so i'm going to go with the siren lashes by house of
5:02lashes to give the I a fun and unique look I'm going to take a little bit of
5:06black eyeshadow and a really tiny tiny TV brush I'm going to place that right
5:11here where the lash stops right next to the roots of my lower lashes to the
5:16inner . of my eye so to speak and then once i reach that inner corner
5:22I drag it out a little bit as if you would do an inner corner cat . like with
5:26the Arabian style smokey eyes and then just leave that line there and it just
5:30makes your eyes look so cat-like and defined and i really like this for
5:42cheeks today I want to keep it soft glowy and very flushed
5:46so first going to contract just a tiny teeny bit using heroin eyeshadow by
5:50illamasqua there's a warm of my complexion a little bit i'm taking my
5:58macro find golden bronzer or blush today I'm using bobby brown's pink coral just
6:08to give that flesh that pop of cheek and for a highlighter of course better
6:15shimmering skin Perfector press two moons
6:18and let's go glowy up in heel
6:32for lips the first using Mac's a little pencil in boldly bear just to give
6:36myself a little bit more depth and volume and then for the lip gloss and
6:46making a mixture with honest as a perfectly hills lip gloss the new lip
6:50gloss is amusing - I'm using a dainty and undressed and together this is like
6:56the perfect nude gloss
6:58it's so everything so I'm putting dainty on my top lip and undressed on the lower
7:08lip and then to mix them all you want to do is smack them lips together girl
7:16and that concludes the makeup now on to the hair
7:20so for my hair today I'm using the new new me tighten three curling iron set it
7:25comes with three curling wands and this is the medium one
7:29this is the small of course we got our big one
7:32so it comes to three wines and today I'm going to start off by using the medium
7:37sized curling wand I actually used it to curl the hair of my model for a campaign
7:41to yesterday and it rocked my socks off
7:45I created such a full glamorous voluminous hair do for that shoot using
7:50this curling set and a 1 not use it in my video today and not only do i think
7:55it is an absolute great quality but the fact that it has a three ones it's
8:00perfect for beginners out there because you don't have to buy three separate
8:04curling irons it also comes with a heat protectant glove if you're not used to
8:08curling hair with one of these curling ones and this is great because i
8:13actually burned my finger because i forgot to put the glove on top of the
8:18glove on it heats up to 200 Celsius degrees which is hot
8:23so again use the glove and there's a little push the button right here and
8:28that will release the wand
8:30so I'm going to go for the medium one so I'm taking the medium one and then you
8:34just click it on

8:40we're just going to part a little section of

9:00way to the ends and keep it there so I'm not starting all the way at the roots
9:05and really just curling the ends and i'm just going to sit for about 10 seconds
9:10and then for this section of hair right in front of it so the new section we
9:14grab you want to curl it in words

0:19inspired makeup tutorial this one today is inspired by kim kardashian so her
0:24makeup artist Mario instagrammed what products he used for the eyes is so

0:33so without any further ado if you want to know how to get this kim kardashian
0:37grammys inspired makeup look then please stay tuned
0:40ok guys so the first thing i'll be doing is applying a base of violence to
0:44prevent everything from creasing and as always amusing imacsoft worker paint pot
0:48and I literally have like one or two uses left which I'm shitting my pants
0:53because i have like a big event tomorrow and I need my soft ochre and we focus on
0:59my I the first I shall be using is by on accessibility hills and this is stone
1:04and a little miss stone is going to be my transition shade so this is going
1:09right in the crease and blending up and out
1:13once you reach that outer corner here just going to flick your brush to decide
1:19like this
1:21ok and then with a bigger fluffy blending brush I'm going to drag that
1:26onto the in your corner and kind of rounded out right here
1:30then on the outer third of my living them to take on accessibility hills in
1:34Emerald i'm just applying the street to the outer third and then with another
1:41clean blending brush I'm going to diffuse the edges into that outer V that
1:46we just created right here
1:48blended into the mix make it one
1:54our next color is going to be on the fuzzy briefly hills moss and i'm
1:57applying this color straight onto the lid to the middle so from emerald it
2:02goes into moss
2:04you just want to apply it their all the way up to the crease
2:09kind of go towards those inner corners also but not all the way kind of leave
2:13some space open for now I'm taking the next my pencil in cottage I mean Nikki
2:18tutorials that and this is going straight on to that inner tear duct area
2:24and then with unessential Beverly Hills soft gold I'm going over top and this is
2:30also a shadow used by her makeup artist and so I'm taking a pencil brush and
2:35going over top of the jumbo pencil by NYX to really get that highlight going
2:40because I feel like Kim's look was all about the highlight and the glow and the
2:45illumination and then also you want to apply it onto that inner third of the
2:50lid blending into that Moss color for the lower lash line you want to take
2:54moss again and that is going from outer to inner corner and then i'm applying a
3:03little bit of emerald on the outer corners to darken it and sauce called on
3:10the inner corners
3:20now to grab the look I'm going to use an eyeliner and today I'm using campanis
3:24tattoo liner in trooper just to get my outline and you want to start out by
3:28creating a line aiming towards the end of your eyebrows and then from there
3:32drag it back onto the lid and then what I like to do now is drag it all the way
3:39to the inner corners then also to elongate the eyes you want to extend the
3:48inner corner just a tiny bit and then I'll filling everything in with my NYC
3:55black liquid liner
3:59all right all you want to do now to complete the eyes is apply some cold to
4:03the waterline i'm using max power surge
4:06I'm going to do this off camera because doing this on camera is a living hell
4:10and then now all you have to do is a pie little bit of mascara to top and bottom
4:14lashes and some faults is of course we're talking to Kim Kardashian here and
4:17i'm using the house of lashes temptress wispy
4:30yeah
4:31for chicks it wouldn't be a Kardashian video if you're gonna go all the way
4:35with contouring blush and glow and all the magics on the face
4:39so first going to contour my face using my LS guy shadow in heroin and i'm going
4:44to use a mixture of two brushes i'm going to use these away by 109 because a
4:48lot of people told me that I should try this
4:50after hating the NARS one and then also my trusty old Mac 163 just because it
4:57works for me
4:58now this i do like pollen Ouya you can make like super sharp stripes with it
5:04and then blend up this is like a hardcore contour brush if you're feeling
5:09like getting them cheekbones carved out like no other
5:13this is your brush that this is what the nurse eater brush was supposed to do for
5:18me that you further bronze up my face i'm going to use the mac refined golden
5:22bronzing powder and with my makeup studio as a one brush never blush
5:29Mario on his Instagram told everyone that the blush used on Kim was nars
5:34orgasm
5:35so why not use that one
5:41and lastly for highlighter i'm going to use of the bomb
5:46mary-lou manizer
5:55yeah
5:57and that's it for cheeks
5:59Kim's lips were super nude and glossy so first going to give myself a little bit
6:03more volume and plump using the design pro lip pencil in mehran more on them
6:15for lipstick i'm going to use macs a flash pot and then as a gloss

1:10to prevent everything from creasing and i'm using my soft ochre Paint Pot which
1:15is almost done and with days away but 142 and just buffing this into my lids
1:22the first crease color are we using is warm taupe by Anasazi berkeley hills and
1:27the brush I'm using for this is a zueva - 27 you first want to focus on the
1:33outer half of your lid so actually placing the brush onto the lid and then
1:38from there you want to flick it into the outer crease right here and then start
1:46blending it out and diffusing that color
1:52as your blending it out you can see that it's starting to build the definition
1:59and it's starting to shape the I then taking a massage and Beverly Hills a
2:03nude and i'm blending this lightly above the brown that we just placed and also
2:09towards the inner crease right here
2:13so the new color is really really light but it still gets the tiniest bit of
2:17definition on my fair skin tone for the living to take this amazing bh cosmetics
2:22a while child palette i am loving this
2:25and the color are we using for my lid is this white shimmery color here and this
2:30pinky color

2:40here is just such a vivid glamorous nude color I love this bh pallid they come in
2:47three types and the wild child is my favorite because it's got all these new
2:51d colors and the pink and the purple and the peachy is a great great palate and
2:55they look awesome apply dry but i will apply a color to my lower lashline wet
3:01damp and it's just out of this world chrome heaven
3:04it's amazing to warm up my outer feet a little bit more and taking this new
3:08color pop super shock cheek in Swift and just a tiny bit of that goes again on
3:15that outer corner and this is to bring in some warmth for the lower lash i'm
3:21going to take this color right here and apply it with a damp brush and then
3:28immediately right after with a dry brush go over top with that same color and
3:34that will sort of kick it up really nicely and they will give it that super
3:38awesome chrome finish to further highlight the inner corners I'm taking

1:22going on but then in the crash at this warmth
1:25so I'm just going to place this here and then also wing it out
1:28and of course it wouldn't be a goggle look if we didn't go all the way to the
1:33inner corners
1:35now i'm going to go into max plumage and this will be used as the winged shape so
1:41with an angled brush I'm going to create a line that is going towards the end of
1:44my eyebrow you want to go high up goggles line almost reached the end of
1:49her eyebrows so it's totally fine to go high up and go extreme with this one and
1:56then from that line go ahead and pull it back to the lid and of course fill in
2:05using that same color
2:07then I'm going to blend that out with a pencil brush using the same mac color
2:11but also mixing it with a little bit of a necessity of Beverly Hills mermaid and
2:16literally all you want to do is grab that pencil brush and diffuse the edges
2:21of the line that you just created and for now it doesn't have to be super
2:25precise on the lid
2:27but the close to you come to word the point of the eyeliner you want to keep
2:31it really tiny and need to precise
2:37so just keep lending and making it soft and diffused for the lid him first going
2:43in with this color pop super shock shadow in sugar and this bad boy is
2:48going on to the center of the lid so plumage and mermaid kind of stopped here
2:53and then from there you want to continue using sugar and then going over top with
2:59honest as a Beverly Hills
3:00I see there for me in her third and inner corners and going to take a legend
3:06also buy omnicef early Hills who's going right on that inner third and inner
3:13corners now going back into plumage by mac and then to create a more definite
3:20line
3:21so right now it's all kind of like healing and we're getting there but i
3:24want a super defined line as if it's an eyeliner going way up now for the lower
3:34lash line again taking plummet and we're running this as i said on the lower lash
3:40line but you want to connect it to that eyeliner part ride here just connected
3:47to it and then what you want to do is drag it towards the inner corners then
3:53i'm taking mermaid and I see by honestly berkeley hills again and smoking it out
3:58all right now what really made this look where the sparkles and the sparkles were
4:07all over and i love that so I'm going to take my dual effects and shine my makeup
4:11studio and I'm going to dazzle it all over the light parts of the eye
4:22and that's it for the eyeshadows i'm not going to apply some mascara
4:26do you give a base for my lashes and the lashes i'll be using our right of the
4:30lower and these are the adult meet up for the cheeks Gaga didn't really have a
4:39whole lot going on so i'm gonna do is bronze and warm of my complexion a bit
4:43using some contouring powder and bronzer the blushes and highlighters first part
4:47is i'm going to use is always is my heroine eyeshadow by illamasqua then to
4:57further warm of my complexion and taking the two-faced at milk chocolate bronzer
5:01then for blush and then use a shocker Luminoso and then to highlight my
5:13complexion
5:14i'm going to use the becca shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone using mine
5:18ours either brush after my January hits and God knows a lot of people told me
5:23that the nurse either brush is perfect for highlighting so I'm gonna give it a
5:27go to digg when bam bam bam
5:33I mean it's okay
5:36alright so what I think of it is that i have to dip into my highlighting powder
5:40a lot more with the nurse eda as opposed to my England for SS brush so so far
5:46i I'm just really not a fan of this brush I'm sorry I'm also just going to
5:51highlight the bridge of my nose tip of my nose keeps both the works that the
5:55further cheeks
5:56all right last step is the lips that you don't really want to overdraw the lips
6:01with the pence or anything you just want to New them out to get a really nice
6:04fleshy skin new tone and after that i'll be using Mac's flash pot and then you
6:14sort of what this natural flush of a gloss over top and the product that
6:18totally rang my bell for the book was the bourgeois color burst in color
6:26births it all faded off because I've had it for so long but the color is peach on
6:31the beach and it's one of those glossy bombs that just ask the tiniest bit of
6:35color
6:36it still gives the color and sheen and flush
6:39so this is going right over top and that's the guys that concludes my lady

2:08eyeshadow palette and it's this color ride here and this is going to be my
2:13transition shade so i'm going to apply this right into the crease and i'm using
2:19a zueva - 27 for this and i'm also going to go ahead and come to the inner corner
2:26of my crease sort of speak

3:41you don't want to take this too far down because then we'll look like a sort of
3:46sick rabbit
3:47no we just want to diffuse the line a little tiny bit so it makes it look a
3:52little bit more like a haze
3:54ok not to highlight the inner corners I'm again taking my new obsession
3:58apparently the cottage cheese a jumbo eye pencil by NYX i do not know what
4:02they call this cottage cheese and just dab this onto the very inner corner and
4:08then i'm going to go over with a shimmering pink
4:10I show all right i wanted to do now to complete the eyes is the price of
4:17mascara too much hot flashes only and of course falsies and the folders of using
4:23r by r del and these are the wispies all right onto cheeks Africa cheeks mila

4:46cheeks

5:08line blended up
5:10so starting from my contour i'm going to go up and this will make my contour look
5:15a little bit more pink it will rose it up but it will also add a blush to my
5:20face then because the shine on me less space also was really soft and subdued
5:25I'm going to keep it small with my highlighter today I try
5:29I'm going to take max soft and gentle mineralize skinfinish and warm it up
5:33using

2:22from the crease up to my brow bone and what this will do is help blend out the
2:27crease color easier prettier and better the first crease color on the take comes
2:34from the tart tart with pellet and it's this grayish color right here and with
2:39a's away by 227 i'm going to start applying this to the crease and we're
2:44not really cutting the crease but we definitely do want a prominent crease so
2:50go ahead and carve in the crease right here then I also go ahead and wing that
2:55out just slightly there with a light gray color I'm going to diffuse the
3:02edges and make it look more soft and the item using comes from these away for

4:47liquid glitter base as my adhesive and the Glitter amusing is also my lips and
4:52this is Marilyn Monroe sighs number three
4:55so my mixture looks like this and there was an eyeliner brush you just want to

0:36she looked stunning see it today i'll be doing a tutorial on that look I
0:41absolutely loved it
0:42so without any further ado if you want to know how to get this look right here
0:46then please stay tuned
0:48so my skin currently is dry as so i'm going to put an argan oil on this is by
0:54josie maran and this is the pure argan oil light's it's the light one
1:00oh my god is gonna so dry oh hey them so disappointing you and the other products
1:06have been really liking to punch up my dry skin is the two-faced hangover
1:11primer on this smells heavily it has coconut water
1:16electrolytes and probiotics in it
1:20sure and this also is great for if you are having a little bit of a rough skin
1:27de que on to foundation so I've been trying to make sure out for a couple of
1:31days and i'm really liking it
1:33it's a mixture of the Studio Fix fluid by mac and the cavity lucky tattoo
1:37foundation
1:39and light 42 and i'm just going to . this mixture onto my face and I'll be
1:46buffing this in using my Sigma f80 688 baby eight
1:59so because we're doing smokey is inspired by jlo chances are that these
2:03smoky colors the dark colors will drop down onto her face and create bought a
2:09little trick it's the first year for nation
2:11then do your browse to your eyes and then once you reach the bottom portion
2:16of your eyes you first put concealer and all that on so that you will not have
2:20any cloud
2:21so what I'm going to do now is do my brows off camera and then it will be
2:25back
2:26so I already put down my base is my mac soft ochre Paint Pot and the first thing
2:30I'm going to do now is taking a light matte eyeshadow I'm taking this color by
2:35these Oh Ava smoky eyeshadow palette because it suits my skin tone a lot and
2:40in order to get this blending to be on fleek you want this blending to be
2:44perfect
2:45a little trick is to put down a net-like color all over the ice first and then
2:50whatever you put on top glides is so much easier and blends is so much easier
2:55so that's a great trick
2:57so I'm taking the light color and it's going all over my eyes from lid two
3:05brow-bone the former transition shades the colors i'll be using our by makeup
3:09geek in unexpected the shape right here and also day raised by Anasazi Beverly
3:15Hills
3:16so I'm just taking the two and tilting my brush up and then smooth this in to
3:22the crease and this is going from outer to inner corners because J Lo has really
3:27nice deep set eyes and we want to mimic that plus her makeup artist when all the
3:33way in also and make it as smooth as possible because this will be our
3:37transition shade there now mixing day rate with purple rain by makeup geek and
3:42with this we are going to start defining that crease out even more
3:45so again same position for the brush and go right in that crease and start
3:52building the definition and smokiness
3:57where the lid him again taking two colors i'm mixing Anasazi Beverly Hills
4:05utopia with make a peek
4:07prom night I'm first laying this down using my finger and this is going all
4:14over the lid and then with a brush you can go back in and define now taking
4:22purple rain and a little bit of black eyeshadow i'm going to deepen the outer
4:26parts of my eye
4:27I'm not cleaning up my under eye area by using my foundation brush and getting
4:32rid of any fallout that i may have and then now it's time to do the concealer
4:37and then we can work on the lower lash line so I'm going to really quickly pop
4:40some concealer on
4:41ok now i'm going to go back into purple rain and running all the way along my
4:46lower lash line now with a pencil brush I'm going to soften the lines and make
4:58them
4:58ultra ultra smoky because they were super smoky on JLo now going in with the
5:04tiniest bit of black and running it straight to the base of the roots of my
5:07lower lashes
5:12time to darken that water line i'm taking my our class at one point five
5:16millimeter mechanical gel liner and then JLo was also rocking this super sexy
5:21inner corner eyeliner push it was very vixeny and kidney and it was very very
5:27sexy
5:28so I'm going to take my Kevin eat a two liner in trooper and i'm going to make
5:32just a really tiny teeny . on the inner corners just to elongate the eyes and
5:37make more cat shapes and then all we want to do now is run a little bit of
5:43black eyeshadow along the routes of my top lashes so it's a complete the look
5:54all you want to do now is the PI falsies and the ones i will be using our max 36
5:58lashes and these are perfect because on JLo you could definitely see that they
6:03are the art of corners really flared out and give that cat shaped feel again and
6:08these do that
6:09these do that all right time to get that j.lo glow I'm first going to contour
6:13using mobile using my eyeshadow by illamasqua in heroin is a new brush that
6:19I've been wanting to get for years and years never really got to it now I did
6:25the NARS e to brush this one better be good after all that hype underneath
6:30the cheekbone
6:35ok and then to further bronze i'm taking my to face that milk-chocolate light
6:40medium matte bronzer just warming up my face with this for blood shall be using
6:49the Lonnie's illumine oh so just because it goes with everything and jayla
6:54definitely had that really peachy glowy JLo glow and then give yourself that's
7:02super glow and go into becca shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone pressed dog
7:09and this is who basically almost going everywhere on the face
7:13first of all highest point of the cheekbones is a must
7:18Cupid's bow also a must in my humble opinion tip of the nose also a month
7:27JLo had a bridge of the news and this was a new one to me right in the middle
7:34just above the brows JLo had highlight ride here and that's that French shape
7:43so for the lips JLo word this really cool toned pinky nude color it was super
7:48super nude
7:49so we're going to mimic that but she also had a lot of volume with a lip
7:53pencils
7:54so I'm gonna make my lips look more full using the LA girl
7:57auto lip line you're in nude and a little bit of stone by Mac
8:04yeah
8:12for lipstick i'll be using the new Anasazi Beverly Hills a liquid lipstick
8:16in milkshake just because this is their lightest one and it makes my lips look
8:21like
8:22JLo's lips so this is going right over top
8:31so once I've is not going to go back in with the nude other lip liner by la girl
8:37cosmetics and just feathering in that line more softly and then to kind of
8:48punch back the pink bit and for the glass i'll be using a fortune cookie

1:51that layer but for now apply this to be very intercrossing sort of make a little
1:57see shape with this like that and then go two words your nose bridge then
2:05taking another sugar pill shadow this is flame . and with this I'm going even
2:11further to my nose and sort of the inside of my eye
2:20right here on the right track baby

2:29the normal crease on the outer part right here ish then now i'm going in my
2:37color pop super shock pressed pigment in slave to pink and picking some of that
2:42up and applying it really low to the outer corner of my lower lash line and

2:58flame . and continuing from that pink and then taking the pink again and going
3:06on my inner corner now taking sugar pills butter cupcake and this is going
3:14right in the middle and this can go pretty far down and also will end up
3:22with the other colors then with a fluffy blending brush I'm taking the butter

3:34corners of my eyes and then also above that pink and orange now going in with

4:39black stops and placing it there and fading it down so you get this really
4:44nice a sort of deep set eyes effect right here
4:51apply it sort of like a cut crease
4:57okay now all you want to do is finish off with lashes are but before you do
5:01that there's one finishing touch
5:03i bought these little things for nail art and in our little square it's called
5:09squares and I thought when you tilt them a little bit to the other direction they
5:14become like little diamonds
5:16so what I'm going to do is place one mini done of eyelash glue ripen eat the
5:20yellow and that is where i'm going to apply the little stud and then quickly
5:28taking a little bit of makeup studio jewel fix and shine and going over the
5:32yellow and the middle of my eyelids
5:34ok so that's it four eyes now going to apply some lashes
5:42these are the house of lashes iconix and then it will be back
5:46ok so far the cheeks i want to go contoured with a little bit of blush
5:50because my skin is looking very pale right now so i do want all the attention
5:55to still go to the eyes but a little bit of cheek is always good
5:59so first going to contour using my herring eyeshadow by l'a mascot
6:10then for blush I'm going to use a Luminoso by Milani and i'm applying this
6:14straight on to the apples of my cheeks really in the middle there for
6:23highlighter i'm going to use becca moonstone

6:35eye stops and then blend it out and also here on the nose and then I'm actually
6:44quickly going to go back into heroin and I'm gonna define my Cupid's bow right
6:49here so everyone almost everyone naturally has a shadow right in between
6:54here and i'm going to really exaggerated that
7:06and therefore lips are going to keep them nude and then highlight with goals
7:09and added these things that are on my eyes to my lips
7:12also ok so for a lipstick i'll be using my hourglass fam new number one new

0:20hey guys so i recently watched the new music video by Iggy Azalea and jennifer
0:25lopez which is booty and oh my gosh
0:28dead ass so much as I did I couldn't
0:32oh my god these two ladies looked super smokin hot
0:36and I was like okay i need to find someone to do a crazy
0:41smoking hot collapse with and I saw my solution in crispy throw up your hands
0:46if you love a good collaboration see that today's video is inspired by jlo
0:51super gorgeous glowing skin their JLo glow and it's a super wearable look
0:57actually and crispy did her look inspired by Iggy so absolutely don't
1:01forget to check out krispies video I love your videos
1:04she's so talented and subscribe to her and show her some love
1:08but other than that I don't have anything else let's just go right ahead
1:11to this j.lo booty look first product i'm going to use is by L'Oreal and it's
1:16the Lumia chic pure light primer and this is a really light reflecting one
1:21and you could go for the becca shimmering skin Perfector in pearl but I
1:25find that this one right here by L'Oreal has just a little bit more shine to it
1:29and that is exactly what we want today so I'm taking that and blending it in to
1:35my skin for information today I'm again taking my benefit hello flawless oxygen
1:40while brightening makeup foundation
1:42I just because it just it's a beautiful and I'm the car and pure for sure
1:47ivory at first I'm just dotting that onto my face and then i'm taking my new
1:52favorite brush
1:53this is the stigma 3d HD brush and I'm taking a little bit of Evian facial
2:00spray and I'm going to spray the brush and then with the brush to start buffing
2:06in the foundation and what that Evian facial spray is going to do is it's
2:11going to make the brush a little bit more moist and this way its blending in
2:19the foundation in a much more natural way
2:22and every time you feel like your brush is starting to become a little bit more
2:25dry again just respray it every buffin now it's time for concealer and i'm
2:32using my trusty old
2:33mac pro longwear in NC 15 and i'm taking my sigma f 86 and the Evian spray once
2:42more spray it and buffing now I'm quickly going to set my under eye area I
2:51using SI shaping powder by mac and i'm going to do browse off-camera going to
2:56do this all off camera and then we'll be back
2:59ok so now onto eyes the first thing I'm doing is applying a base to my entire
3:04eye area to prevent the eye shadows from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre
3:10Paint Pot for this next I'm going in these songs books a tude palette and I'm
3:14making a mixture with three colors because i find that these three colors
3:18combines may just the perfect crease color for this look so I'm taking a
3:22little bit of caramel toffee and cream dream and with days away that - 20 a
3:28crease brush and just lightly feathering this in my crease
3:34I want this to be really soft and diffused
3:39so once i have most of the products on I will take it up a little bit higher and
3:45higher and higher
3:47I'm taking a little bit of Max emphasize shaping powder and with this i am
3:52highlighting my brow bone and I'm also taking a big and loading it up here on
3:59the inner corners because on JLo those inner corners were so bright and so
4:04intense you really want to lay focus there for the lid on mixing emphasize
4:10partner by Mac again and was a little bit of makeup geeks bling eyeshadow and
4:15as I said this is going onto my lid leading up to the crease and all the way
4:22to be outer corners
4:24what I like to do now is take a more concentrated brush at this is by the way
4:27if i did see - 31
4:29Lux petite crease and going back in my crease shadows and with the tips of the
4:34brush is slightly want to reapply their crease color and that will make it a
4:41little bit more concentrated as I said one of the main features of this look
4:45are those in 10
4:46inner corners so first laying down a bit of next eyeshadow in crystal avalanche
4:52you just want to pack that on that inner corner brightening that up and blending
5:01in a sort of V shape like this then going in with the most shimmering eye
5:06shadow of life
5:08nylon nation of my mac i'm taking a little moist brush and going over top
5:14and nylon damp is just the sparkliest glow easiest shut out of life
5:22ok I'm quickly going to go over to the bottom lash line and it looks super
5:26clean on jail yet still shit definition with those lashes so a little trick is
5:31to make your lower lashes pop we don't want any eyeshadow there is taking a
5:35really small and precise eyeliner for that personally I love to use the
5:39hourglass at 1.5 mechanical gel liner in obsidian and all you want to do is place
5:44a couple of dots on the roots of your lower lashes and then once you put
5:49mascara over top it just gives it way more definition
6:03so I'm aware of the fact that it looks super crazy right now but trust me once
6:07you put the scare over top it looks fine just I mean look at this side looks fine
6:12ok now to define my upper lash line a bit i'm going in my the bomb meets mad
6:17nude eyeshadow palettes and I'm going in the collar
6:20Matt's wood and with an angled brush i'm placing this super close to the roots of
6:27my lashes and slowly start building some definition there
6:33ok so once you've got most of that on you want to take a really small brush
6:38this is the pencil brush by makeup geek and a mixing net would with met rosen
6:43and all you want to do with this is smudge out that lying and make it really
6:51soft and diffused and smoky and lived in a on the waterline I'm quickly running
6:57some been nine year twice or cream crayon in ultralight MP 0 and then to
7:02finish off and curling my lashes and applying mascara and false lashes
7:06mascara is going to be the makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra black and
7:11therefore falsies i'm using these I don't know the brand but they're called
7:15Daisy and these days he wants our supernatural and that is exactly what
7:20you want to go for because JLo have really natural ones on also so I'm just
7:24going to pop this on right now and then we'll be back
7:26now onto cheeks the first thing i'll be doing is sculpting my cheekbones to make
7:30me look a little bit more you know
7:32j.lo and as always i'm using my msg eyeshadow in heroin for this energy is
7:38go to town and sculpt create those cheekbones
7:43but Daniel wasn't wearing any blush it was more so a lot of bronzer and a lot
7:48to lot of shine and glow
7:50so I'm just going to warm up my complexion a bit more using this
7:53bronzing powder by Mac this is called refined golden you kind of want to swirl
7:59it around on the high plains of your face and give yourself that sunkissed
8:04look I'm also gonna use it as a blush a little bit because there's not going to
8:08be any blush and then for that immaculate glow
8:11I'm of course going for my bed night looks from the air powder in
8:14I because this - it's my skin tone the best and this is what's going to give me
8:18the most glowy effect of all the highlighters that I have this doesn't
8:22really suit really dark skin tones nor medium skin tones I think so
8:27the darker of us can tell you are the more golden and bronze you want to go
8:31with your highlighter
8:32so Jennifer was super glowy like everything was a glow and we're even
8:37going in with a spray later on but the key focusing . you want to focus on when
8:42highlighting with a powder for this look is first tops of the cheekbones super
8:48super importance
8:49so right here sort of next to your eye
8:54oh we're going to get the glow up in here
8:57I'm gonna go a little bit further of course i'm taking a pencil brush and I'm
9:02highlighting my nose by just drawing a line in that little scoop here and onto
9:09the bridge of my nose and then on the highest tip of your nose
9:13please a little . highlighter like so and that is going to live the tip of
9:20your nose up now what I really noticed is that there is a lot of highlighter on
9:24the Cupid's bow but also on the highest point of the forehead and then as I said
9:31you also want to do
9:32cupids bow take a little bit more and onto the highest point of your tin for
9:40me that's right here
9:46right there so I'm going to take 6 plus x mac and whenever you want super ultra
9:51glow super high do we finish fix plus and I'm quickly going in with a
9:59stippling brush and stipple this out
10:04so you get an even do we finish and then to finish of this look all you need to
10:08do is your lips
10:10so I'm going to completely blank on my lips because her lips were nude
10:14so I'm taking the hourglass lipstick in some nude number one because i wanted to
10:18use myth by Mac but i found that to be too dead in the face so I want a little
10:23bit more and miss her and then 4a plus i'm using this
10:31illamasqua sheer lip gloss in exquisite
10:37I may want to take a little bit more and especially focusing on the highest point
10:41of your Cupid's bow to really reflect that light

1:18that has been so talked about that you just you just want to try a sample of it
1:25because everyone is talking about it and the products i'm talking about is our
1:29glasses and mineral veil primer

2:28then with that . you can actually reach the eye is really easily oh my god
2:34alright so that is an absolutely fantastic brush i really recommend this
2:40one
2:41so for concealer I either wanted to go for AV NARS creamy concealer because I
2:46youtube is like you either use the nurse creamy concealer or use the pro longwear
2:50and I want to use Pro Longwear because it's my wish and then it's about this
2:58and i'm using my Sigma f80 six and i'm going to set my under eye area using
3:08emphasize shaping partner by Mac all right now I'm going to do browse off
3:13camera because if I did that on camera this video will become way too long but
3:18the product i'll be using for my brows are also buzzed about makeup products i
3:22will be doing my eyebrows using the Anasazi Beverly Hills brow ways and ash
3:28blonde and also the dipbrow pomade in taupe so i'll be doing my eyebrows for
3:34eyes are going to start of by priming them of course and i'm using my soft
3:38ochre Paint Pot by Mac my first eyeshadow is going to come from the
3:46Urban Decay Naked 3 palette and it's going to be the color
3:50nooner reason why i chose the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette is because it's
3:55the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette i am taking nooner and i'm going to apply it
3:59straight to the crease and first mainly focusing on this outer edge here but
4:09then once most product is on
4:11I work my way to the inner corners of my crease for the let him taking my own
4:19estas de Beverly Hills
4:20tamannah pellet and going in the color china rose and I'm applying this to the
4:26inner half of my lids and oh can you look at this
4:32color i am now going in that same palette and then taking song griha and
4:37this is going on the outer half of the lid meeting up to the crease and then
4:44I'm actually taking a blending brush with sangria and applying this to the
4:50crease to give it a little bit of that warmer color that song right has its a
4:57blended in nicer then still using the term on appellate and going in chocolate
5:02and for this look I want a fairly colorful lid and really smoky liner and
5:07underneath portion so this is going from inner to outer corner of the lower lash
5:12line and then to blend this out and give it a nice smoky feeling going back into
5:20sangria and i'm using this to soften and blend out chocolate on the lower lash
5:29line and then now it's time for the liner i'm taking my Sigma wicked
5:36standout eyes gel eyeliner to start off with
5:40and i'm going to start off with a line right here determining where I want my
5:45angle to go to from my line
5:54and then switching over to the cabin D tattoo liner in trooper this product has
6:00been talked about so so much
6:02first let's just fill in that sort of triangle we create it ok then for the
6:08inner corner for this little thing right here
6:11you want to look down and sort of pull the top line of your inner corner down
6:18from that line you go back to the the lower lash line portion and then you
6:24have a little trying to fill it in and fill up and then all we want to do is
6:37connect this corner to that line right there
6:49on the waterline am using the hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel liner in
6:54obsidian and this is one of the products that I wish is going to create some
6:59serious buzz in the community
7:04I'm really a lover of putting something right underneath the pupil of the eye
7:09so for this I'm going to use my born pretty store nail art wheel thingy majig
7:14right here and there are some seriously small gold studs in there and i'm just
7:19going to pop them right on the skin on the eye on everything
7:32ok so there's that now to completely finish off the eyes I need some falsies
7:36i'll be using my shen x 0
7:38soul mates lashes alright so for takes the first gonna sculpt and contour the
7:45face and i'm using my understanding of Beverly Hills contour kit for this
7:49everyone also and their mamas grandma's grandpa's everyone is using the Contras
7:57kid on YouTube to either highlights or contours
8:00so I figured that is what i'll be using and i'm going to take a little bit of
8:03this color right here because it's the coolest out of the three and i
8:07definitely need that with my pal skin tone so I'm just going to start carving
8:15the cheeks out

0:36like what you see and you want to know how I got it
0:39then please state you so first thing I'm going to be doing is applying a base to
0:43my eyelets and this is going to help prevent the eye shadows from creasing
0:47plus it's just going to make everything look a lot more vivid and intense and
0:52just overall better
0:54really and for this I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot then I'm going in
0:59the UH Nastasia Beverly Hills Miami appellate and I'm taking the color warm
1:04taupe and with a zoo Eva - 28 crease brush
1:08I'm just focusing this in my crease going from inner to outer corner and
1:15this is going to be our crease definition color and i absolutely love
1:21warm taupe from the Miami appellate because it gives definition but it's not
1:26too warm
1:27nor is it to cool toned it's just the perfect brown really then what days away
1:32but - 34 lux smokey shader and picking some of warm taupe up again and focusing
1:39this on the inner part of my lid sort of the inner third and blending up to the
1:47crease so that they meet and i'm also focusing it on the outer third
1:53so you leave a nice clean gap in the middle you can even focus it in the
2:00crease a little bit more to do with some definition we just want to keep that
2:05middle part bear with a fluffy brush
2:08go ahead and blend that out and soften the edges really importante
2:15so for the middle part i'm taking the UH Nastasia metallic luster liner and this
2:19is a liquid gold this is one of my favorite products at the moment so you
2:23want to look down and paint this at the middle of your lid I kind of an
2:28off-center day
2:30with the bro oh we're just going to ignore that so once you've got that in
2:34the middle you want to take a pencil brush
2:36this is x sigma and you want to diffuse the edges with the brown
2:41actually i'm going to add a little bit more Brown here because up off center
2:48and then I'm going into my Anasazi Beverly Hills taman address your face
2:53palette and it has a color called a blush which is the perfect color to
2:57highlight that liquid gold pencil even more so with the same brush I'm taking
3:02blush and going over top slightly so we can blend the edges a little bit better
3:09with the brown then for the lower lash line them again picking up a warm taupe
3:15and we're mimicking the top on the bottom so warm too hope is going on that
3:22outer part of my lower lashline meeting up with the brown hear that outer corner

3:54was taking one of my favorite Sparkle

3:59places where i applied the liner to give it some more Sparkle and pizzazz and i'm
4:05also going to punch some on the inner part of my eyes to sparkle it up and
4:09open it up and make it more MORE
4:17now I'm picking up a little bit of Anasazi Beverly Hills waterproof cream
4:24color in jets and basically what I'm doing with it is drawing a really small
4:29and precise line covering the roots of my lashes to give the look a little bit
4:34more depth and to make the false lashes that put on top
4:38blend in nicer so it's just do camouflage the lashes and the brush I'm
4:43using for this actually came with that maybelline liquid no gel eyeliner set is

0:51super sexy smoking hot i love it
0:54yeah without any further ado if you want to know how to get this look right here
0:57then please stay tuned
0:59so to start this look off i'm taking a new favorite this is my mac care blend
1:04of essential oils in grapefruit and chamomile
1:07so I'm just going to take about four drops of that and apply that to my face
1:14it's very early right now and I feel like with kidneys a little bit of glow
1:18to it because I love dead i'm going to take the becca shimmering skin Perfector
1:21e in opal and just take one pump of that and then also apply that to the face for
1:30my foundation today I'm going to take l'oreal true match in c1 and then I'm
1:34bluffing this in using my Sigma f80 brush and give yourself a flawless days
1:42for concealer going to go with max pro longwear in NC 15 go crazy on this bish
1:51and then as always buffing this in using my Sigma f80 60 poke yourself now going
2:01to set this all using a little bit of powder this is next studio fix powder in
2:06NW 10 and then i'm going to do browse and one
2:10I off camera and then we'll be back first thing I'm doing is applying a base
2:14to my eyelids to prevent that I should from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft
2:18ochre paint up with this first going to highlight my eye using my shaping powder
2:22by Mac in emphasize and no just
2:25highlighting my brow bone and inner corners but this now for the lid I'm
2:36going into my too faced chocolate bar and I'm taking the really soft pinky
2:40color and was a really big soft fluffy brush you just want to place that onto
2:45the lid to get a soft wash of the color and i love this touch of pink in the
2:52look because the kind of changes the entire feel of it it makes it more
2:56interesting
2:57I am taking a little bit of kid eyeshadow by mac and I'm just a softly
3:02defining my crease with this just because I don't really have deep set
3:07eyes and a doing have that illusion and I noticed that big E's eyes aren't the
3:13biggest of eyes either
3:15so her makeup artist that's this trick as well
3:20therefore the lower lash line and going to take copperplate by mac and mix it
3:24with a little bit of that kid eyeshadow and just to give the lower lash line a
3:28little bit more definition
3:31I'm packing copper plate on on the outer corner here of my lower lash line and
3:36then continuing with kid only i'm going to drag it further in
3:42so you have a dark concentration of copper plate on the outer part and kid
3:49on the inner part on my waterline of popping a bit of jumbo pencil by NYX in
3:54milk and then just on the inner corner only i'm packing on a little bit more of
3:59that emphasize to really open up my eyes for the winged liner and taking NYC
4:06liquid liner in black and we're just going for a really soft ring to line
4:12scoop over it just has a regular same old line as always but I sup right in
4:19the middle of my lid and that will keep the inner part of the ice clean and soft
4:23and natural but you still have that wing going on for that starting line you kind
4:28of want to aim for the end of your eyebrow
4:35and then I like to go in with a black net eyeshadow and really clean up that
4:44edge and with this you can also really make it really nice soft flick at the
4:59end
5:01now i'm going to do to finish off the look is apply a little bit of mascara
5:04this is my makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra black and for lashes I'm gonna
5:08go with the XO beauty
5:11sea lions and when you cut the felines in half
5:14you have the beginning . that flares out to that really flared out end and you
5:19want to cut it in the middle and then you have this really nice flared up
5:24short
5:25you know natural lash you're just going to pop that on the outer part of your
5:29eye and then you have this really nice to look for cheeks there wasn't a whole
5:33lot going on other than a really nice a soft sculpting and soft blush and soft
5:39glow
5:40so that's what we're going for today I first going to contour style pleasing my
5:44LS guy shadow in heroin there for blush I'm using a little bit of launch away by
5:55mac and this is just a beautiful soft peachy color and that is exactly what
6:00you want to go for soft and peachy and then for my glow today I'm again taking
6:07my Ben Nye lumiere looks powder in ice
6:10just because this gives the most stunning a glow of life for lips you
6:20want to go for a classic red and further mixing tool it mixes by mac i'm using
6:25crimson and read and read because it is a little bit more orange based in a
6:30little bit more bright and crimson for that nice deepness

0:50ok so the first thing I'm doing is applying a base to my eyelids to prevent
0:54the eye shadows from creasing and to make the colors pop a lot more than they
1:00normally would and for this I'm using Mac's soft ochre Paint Pot then to give
1:05my crease some definition I'm taking max sculpting powder in taupe and I just
1:10take a little bit of that and start applying it to my crease and with really
1:14soft movements you want to go from outer to inner corner and then blend up really
1:21softly now i'm taking the max shaping powder in emphasize and with emphasize
1:27i'm highlighting my brow bone and blending down that taupe color that we
1:32applied previously and this way it will get an even nicer blend and also I like
1:37to load this up on the inner corners and blend up right here for the lid of
1:43taking that mac emphasize partner again and mixing it with makeup geeks
1:47eyeshadow in shimma shimma and i'm applying this combo to my lid area a
1:54nice a light neutral shimmery color to make the bright colors stand out even
2:01more
2:02i'm going to start off by taking savage from the Urban Decay electric palette
2:06and I'm applying this color to be very inner corner of my eye
2:12this is going to be my beginning . of the eyeliner and you can make this as a
2:17thick and dramatic as you want i'm going to go quite far with it because I love
2:23that
2:23next up is
2:24sugar pills of flame points i shadow you want to place a flame . right in the
2:30middle of the line and blending the edges with savage and you just want to
2:39keep reapplying the colors until you get the desired intensity and color payoff
2:44and then at the end i like to wet my brush with a little bit of water and
2:50trays the top to get a nice clean edge
2:54next in line a little bit of red this is a left plus by sugarpill and you guessed
3:00it
3:01this is going right next to flame . and again you want to blend the edges in
3:07with the previous color and just drag that to the outer corner of your lashes
3:12your lash line for the wing i'm using a purple this is sugar pills poison plum
3:17and you want to make your wing with this and from the outer . of your winged
3:21dragon back to the red then you guessed it you want to fill that in and
3:32eventually blend the edges with the red
3:36so taking a bit of that red and reapplying it in between that orange and
3:42the purple to give a really nice gradient know what you can do is throw a
3:47little bit of mascara and false lashes on this look in your dawn color today
3:51and have a really nice rainbow eyeliner I'm however going to take it all the way
3:56so i'm going to take the cooler shades of the rainbow and apply those to the
4:01bottom part of my eyes
4:03so for the blue which is going on the outer part of my lower lash line from i
4:08educate electric palette i'm going to take a chaos and gonzo and i'm just
4:12applying them really close to the roots of a lower lashes
4:16connecting to that purple for the green portion I'm taking sugar pills and
4:22midori and Urban Decay electric thrash and this is going on to the middle of my
4:30lower lash line and i'm going to drag it down quite far because i want to give
4:35the lower portion of the eye
4:37I was really nice grungy sunken-in feel and it kind of blends in better with the
4:43sort of i jewelry that i'm going to apply later on then to open up the inner
4:47corners a bit more
4:49I am dragging down my new inner corner so i'm going to create this new inner
4:53corner illusion by just dragging a line a little bit further away from the
4:58actual inner corner and then to open that I up and use my glass color of the
5:10rainbow which is yellow
5:11I'm going in butter cupcake by sugarpill and I like to really load that up on the
5:17new inner corner that we created you just want to feel that line of and
5:23packet on on the inner corner area right here and bam your rainbow is the whole
5:30the way I am quickly highlighting my inner corners using that emphasize
5:34powder by Mac then run a little bit of milk jumbo pencil by nicks on the
5:42waterline and now i'm going to take this super gorgeous mill decoration sort of
5:47it's not a sticker it's sort of like a little you know a little piece of paper
5:53and I thought because this has a really nice triangular shape to it why not
5:57place it on the middle of my lower lash line and that gives us really nice sort
6:01of you know
6:03golden touch to the look I'm going to grab a little bit of glue place a little
6:07. and you know put this over top and then we have this really nice
6:12I decoration going on to finish off the look i'm taking my makeup cydia

1:16easy to work with and you just want to do this so I'm going to have high the
1:20mac complete comfort cream and i really like this one because it's quite thick
1:25and it's very very moisturizing and that is exactly what i wanted a because my
1:31skin feels kind of drawing today was always there for foundation today I'm
1:36going to go with the mac mineralized moisture foundation in NC 15 and the
1:41first is gonna . this wherever I want it and then with my Sigma f80 brush I'm
1:48going to start stippling and buffing this in
1:58for concealer today with me is my mac prolongwear concealer and my Creole on
2:03Dara Mac holler cream concealer in d0 and I'm placing that right underneath my
2:09eyes on on this very inner corner here also and then drag it dawn and just do
2:15that entire highlighting thing okay and then once I've got that mess all applies
2:20in my face is gonna fit in with my f-86 by stick it in college it out
2:33I stupid bitch okay i'm going to set this all using some powder 100g is my
2:39mac studio fix powder foundation powder and number and the w 18 and I'm gonna do
2:46browse than 1i off-camera and then we'll be back
2:49the first thing I'm doing is applying a base two eyelets to prevent that shadow
2:53from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint pop for this now going in
2:59the Sigma brilliant and spellbinding eyeshadow palette and I'm taking the
3:03color balmy and with a big blending brush i'm applying this to the crease
3:08and then blending up and to the sides you want this to be very smoky and
3:15blended out and hazy just sexy really from that same brilliant and
3:21spellbinding sigma IV the palette i'm taking radiant and i'm applying radiant
3:27to the inner part of my crease very lightly and white brush off and diffuse
3:33the edges and blended in with ball we and i love that later on we're going to
3:39have that really serve dark Toby brown lip and then that warmth on the eyes
3:45I love that i'm going to highlight using the shaping powder by Mac called
3:50emphasize and that was just going on my brow loan and with this you can really
3:57blend out radiant as well and i also like to load it up on this inner corner
4:04here i'm taking a bit of makeup geek mocha eyeshadow and first
4:11applying this right near the roots of my lower lashes about half way in from
4:20there I'm going to go back into the crease from that lower lash line up to
4:28the crease so you can nicked it and then slightly start blowing it to the sides
4:34and then still working with mocha I'm building this up on the very outer edge
4:45of my I really build definition there as the base for my lady I'm taking this
4:54makeup revolution awesome metals eyeshadow in magnificent copper and this
4:59is a really nice creamy products i'm just going to take it with my finger and
5:03dab it onto the lid it's very very pretty and sparkly and intense but i
5:10just want that sparkle for my base so not as much the color more so that
5:16sparkle because that is brilliant overtop of Devon going back into the
5:22stigma brilliant spell lighting palette and I'm taking number 10 and I'm simply
5:27applying this over top of that awesome metal eyeshadow by makeup revolution and
5:35you still get that amazing Sparkle from that from the base but you slightly ship
5:41the color a more topi way
5:45ok now for the very inner corner your first one to make a new sort of tear
5:49duct area so you want to take a black liquid liner and then draw a tiny tiny
5:55mythical little line on the very inner corner and you drag it out of it so you
6:00create this elongated in the corner for this i'm taking my NYC eyeliner liquid
6:05liquid eyeliner in black you know I got this because of crispy and this is going
6:09to be so balls hard to do on camera so i'm probably going to do it off camera
6:14and then mimic the movement
6:16ok so i did it how you do it you want to tilt your head down create this sort of
6:203rd kin and then you want to make a
6:23little tiny line coming straight out of your tear ducts from that point there
6:29you go back into the eye and then fill that little gap up now going back in
6:35sumo cup i'm going to follow that new sort of direction that my new inner
6:40corner when two and then in between this we're going to use a sparkle because
6:50what sparkles really reflects light and that really gives you that feeling of a
6:56new sort of inner corner creation so to make with sparkle stick i'm going to
7:00take my make up forever aqua liner in number 19 and first laid down as a based
7:08in between the two new lines it's basically your new in a corner now
7:15now I like to go in my makeup studio dual effects and shine and go right over
7:21top of what I'm going to pop a little bit of white liner this is milk jumbo
7:33pencil by nicks and I just tracing this on my waterline are away from the black
7:38so where the black stops right there you want to go with the white and this will
7:41really open up the eyes okay now with that same NYC liquid liner going to
7:45create a nice dramatic winged eyeliner on top
7:58now all you want to do is finish is off with a little bit of mascara I'm using
8:02my makeup studio waterproof 3d and extra black ever lashes going to use the XO

8:30complexion of amusing illamasqua blush in disobey and just from that contour

8:43because we have these brown eyes warm skin we're going to have brown lips you
8:48kind of want to have a little bit of light somewhere i'm gonna go for pink
8:51because that really punches up the look and for that I'll be using my mac blush
8:56in love cloud and smell and put it on your apples and this just brings back
9:04life into the look too much browns and bronzes and golden shades can really
9:10make your face look tired believe it or not so by adding this pop of pink to the

0:12hey guys today no smokey eyes and new lips no it's time to go back into fall
0:18it's time to do a inspired makeup tutorial on an artist that has been
0:23loving lately and she recently came out with a song called break the rules and
0:28for me
0:29charli XCX is break the rules is the song of the year . i love the music
0:36video i love charli XCX i I just I love everything about her salad so edgy and
0:42cool and her makeup was awesome and break the rules so I decided to do a
0:47charli XCX inspired makeup tutorial especially particularly inspired by
0:53break the rules
0:54so if you want to know how to get this look right here then please stay tuned
0:58all right the first thing we're going to do is pry my face to give it a nice base
1:01to work with and I'm using my hourglass mineral veil primer for this
1:06I have heard so many amazing things about this product and that this is
1:11actually my first time trying it
1:13I already can tell it it's very dry and by no means feels very hydrating and
1:19nourishing but it is super soft and velvety
1:23hmm I obviously need to try it a little bit more for foundation today I'm going
1:27to go with a BB cream actually and this is a new favorite this is by Garnier and
1:32this is the pure active BB cream
1:34I'm really really liking this 11 it's affordable to the coverage is absolutely
1:40amazing and let me just put it on you will see
1:43okay at first just gonna put this on my face wherever I want it and I'm not
1:51doing this in with a Sigma f80 brush and I can already tell that the smell of
1:56this is absolutely amazing it has that really iconic pure active cucumber smell
2:04it has a lovely matte texture which is exactly what you want because charli XCX
2:10loves her mad face she does highlight was a glowy product but the overall feel
2:16of her face is really nice and Matt and what I also really like about this BB
2:20cream is that it actually has coverage
2:23I mean this is a you
2:25pn BB cream and normally European BB creams are more like attentive
2:29moisturizer
2:30you can't really get much out of them but this one actually has coverage and
2:35it looks nice and it just it just looks nice on the skin i really really like it
2:41and with that comes is that it also lasts for just something i don't find a
2:47lot of BB Creams do normally they just fade after an hour for this just stays
2:52on the entire day i'm just a huge fan of this it's affordable it stays on long
2:57it looks beautiful the structure is absolutely beautiful it makes you look
3:01met and perfected and I'm just a huge fan of this BB cream
3:07I mean what is going on with me I used to hate BB creams and now i love them
3:10for concealer gonna go with my Mac NC 15 pro longwear concealer and i'm going to
3:15make it a little bit more light to highlight my face using this kryolan
3:19Creole on ID 0a dermablend color
3:34and I'm going to about this in using my Sigma f-86 brush and reason why I went
3:40so like with my concealer is because Charlie has an amazing light complexion
3:47and I just wanted to you know bring up my features a little bit more and also
3:52by mixing that pro longwear with that Creole on a derma blend color the
3:57kreelan dermablend color has a really nice matte coverage so again you will
4:03have their really nice porcelain Matt feel I'm now going to set this always
4:07innovating now naturalist finish part number 20 Claire and also do my brows
4:12off camera which is going to make a little bit more dark because Charlie has
4:16really nice intense and dark brows as well so i'm going to do that all off
4:20camera and then it will be back
4:22so first i'll be applying a base to my eyelids to prevent that I should from
4:26creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this then to define my
4:32crease a little bit i'm taking a mac sculpting powder called sculpt and with
4:38this one lightly bringing definition into my crease to make the eyes appear a
4:45little bit more deep set and larger there was another mac pro sculpting
4:50powder called emphasize I am highlighting my brow bone and inner
4:55corners right here now taking a make up for ever aqua cream in number two and
5:04i'm applying this all over the lid area meeting up into the crease and this is a
5:10beautiful peuterey silver color just exactly what you want to go for then
5:16once you have that base down with a more fluffy brush I'm going to diffuse the
5:22edges up and out so it gets a really nice transition to make that color catch
5:30the light even more i'm taking results from the Urban Decay electric palette
5:34and unlikely packing that on on the middle of my eyelid and diffusing the
5:41edges out to the sides and this way your lid get a really nice
5:46glowing
5:47fact so the brightest part is in the center right here and then you defuse it
5:52out to that peuterey color from make up forever and then just really catches the
5:58light beautifully for the eye liner part i'm taking a matte black eyeshadow and
6:03the first making a line on where I want my wing to go to
6:09now brush some of that black really closely to the roots of your lashes and
6:19then drag it from that point to the lashes fill in and then with another
6:31rush you really want to diffuse the edges of that line you don't want it to
6:35be a really stark and intense eyeliner you just wanted to be a haze of an
6:42eyeliner so go ahead and blend those edges out and then the same black color
6:49is applied to the roots of the lower lashes and then at the outer part here
6:53you want to connected to the liner on top and then just kind of buff in that
7:00black color on the lower lash line now for the inner corners and mixing a bit
7:05of that max sculpting powder in emphasize with makeup geek eyeshadow in
7:09bling packing that on on the very inner corners here to open up the eyes and
7:15then you kind of want to look down and brush it right here now with my
7:21hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel liner in obsidian and then align my
7:26waterline and now it's time for mascara i'm just going to use my makeup studio
7:33waterproof 3d in extra black and on top a little bit of the halika halika magic
7:39pole mascara for the cheeks are going to do a little bit of contouring using my
7:43NYX blush in taupe and a little bit of the mac sculpting powder in sculpt and
7:49with those i'm just going to carve out my cheeks a little bit more to give my
7:53face a bit more definition
7:56for blush of me is one of my favorite colors by Mac this is Melba and just
8:03dust this from the contour up to the cheeks
8:08so you start at your contour and then go on to the cheeks to highlight i'm going
8:13to use another favorite product of mine
8:15this is max pigment in vanilla and this is just it lightly on the tops of my
8:21cheekbones and then blending the edges out for Charlie's iconic met deep red
8:29lips i'm going to use a product mixture of two live mixes by Mac called crimson
8:34and black and you just want to use the tiniest amount of the black to deepen
8:40the crimson color

3:19here because that's what happened on Nicki space and I liked it
3:29ok now i'm going to but that in using my f-86 bass Sigma because i love it
3:38i recently got this comment from a guy on my channel and he was like do you
3:46sleep at night for deceiving men like this by putting on all that makeup and I
3:54just flat-out left for 10 minutes on to get another one that's what you take her
3:59swimming on the first date
4:01it's a good one - really good one
4:04I'll give you ten for that then I'm just going to set my under eye area with my
4:09favorite powder
4:11this one is by chanel and it's the natural is finished in number 20
4:17Claire and I'm going to go ahead and do my brows and one I off camera and then
4:22it will be back
4:23ok the first thing i'll be doing
4:25is applying a base to my eyelids do you prevent this entire creation from
4:28creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot in heaven soft ochre fits the
4:35first I shall going to be working with his kid by neck
4:39I'm just taking that color and placing it in my crease as my transition shade
4:45so this is to blend out that crease color easier later on and then at the
4:53side here you kind of want to swoop it out to give it a nice winged shape and
5:00then go back in and diffuse the edges then i'm going in with Max mystery
5:06eyeshadow and really lightly
5:09i'm going to start defining that crease even more and quite precise as well so
5:18you want to add that mystery in kind of a more precise and concentrated manner
5:26and then also when you get to that side here you want to swoop it out to give
5:30that nice wing
5:34not too much you'll go too far with it and I'm really lightly to fuse the edges
5:40but you really want to have that you know concentration with mystery in the
5:47crease and they can always go back in with a little bit of kid and make the
5:54blend between those two even softer and nicer
5:59just make it a really nice concentrated and diffused crease then for a villain
6:06and going with this amazing new Sigma pigment
6:09this is called Lou shimmer in midsummer and i'm picking some of that up with my
6:14finger and padding it onto the lid area meeting up with the dark brown color in
6:21decrease and you want it from inner corner to outer corner and I just oh my
6:28god I love this color so damn much
6:31then going in with another stigma Lucia more pigment
6:34this is called a gilded and this one is going right in
6:37middle again up to the crease and then blend the edges to the sides and we're
6:45doing this because nikki had this stunning a glowing gold lid and it just
6:55the gold looked like it was glowing and the only technique you have for that to
7:01make something glow is by darkening the outer edges and you know glowing and
7:06making lighter of the center
7:10so those what I'm doing with these pigments for the eyeliner I first really
7:14want to have that strong line where I want my eyeliner to go to you
7:18so for that i'm taking this Real Techniques silicone liner brush and a
7:22little bit of my Sigma gel eyeliner and wicked and what this
7:28I can really determine where I want the start line of my winged liner to go to
7:34and also from there you can drag it back on toward the lashes and now we move
7:44over to my country's liquid liner in dating joe black to do the rest of the
7:48eye line of work
7:58I'm now popping a little bit of concealer on the inner portion of my
8:04eyes to really highlight it and make it clean and crisp and an over top of that
8:11i'm applying a little bit of the bombs and mary lou manizer to finish off the
8:18eyes it's time for mascara and for that I'll be using my waterproof 3d extra
8:23black mascara by making studio combined with a little bit of the halika halika
8:28magic pole mascara and for lashes the mac 36 for the cheeks and nikki had this
8:34amazing warm bronzy glow going on her and I just absolutely love that it's so
8:40sultry and glowing and glam and just beautiful
8:44so I'm gonna go with a mixture of products to get there to get to that
8:48destination
8:50i first go to carve out my cheeks a little bit with my illamasqua eyeshadow
8:54in heroin
9:06then to further warm up my face going to go with a bronzer
9:09this is one of my favorites this is refined golden by Mac I'm just going to
9:14go on my forehead and kinda follow the entire hairline area so we leave like a
9:22nice little spot of brightness in the middle
9:25drag queens call that the battery mode and then also with that I'm going to hit
9:30the hype points of my cheekbones and blend that contour out a little bit more
9:38okay then just start working on the beautiful glow I'm first going to add
9:43some glow with warmth
9:45this is stereo rose and mineralized skin finish my mac and it's really warm and
9:50intense and it actually distribute a little bit of color and this is actually
9:55amazing for medium to dark skinned people girls boys
9:59everyone and switch it on my cheeks so sort of from that entire bronzer thing
10:06we did this comes out on the cheeks and just it gives it a really nice warmth
10:15but because it's a mineralized skin finish it also gives ma zing shine like
10:23it makes you look like plastic or highlight I'm gonna go with becca
10:26shimmering skin Perfector pressed in moonstone because it's nice light and
10:32golden
10:32so it's going to give you that exact same perfect law as Nikki head feel like
10:38I keep talking about myself
10:39ok you take a little bit on a brush place it on the highest points of your
10:44cheeks which is about right on the sides of your eyes and you want to build it up
10:50a little so I'm going to take more and build it up then wipe my brush off and
10:56I'm going to blend the edges out so the main impact of highlight is going to be
11:03here because you pack it on here and then you blend it out
11:08softly and then you're left wait let me get a little bit more of the blush in
11:12and then you're left with this high shine glow which is
11:19exactly what he was wearing
11:22and then lastly what I'm going to do is to really get myself that glow
11:26Julie glow I'm gonna go with my NYX juhi finish a long-lasting setting spray for
11:31sure
11:32good okay and then just spritz your lips you want to go very glossy and nude with
11:42a punch of pink
11:44so for that i'm first going to take my NYX lip pencil in natural with him

0:08hey guys today I'm doing a tutorial and in-depth tutorial on a fresh and easy
0:19back to school makeup look at this is definitely for the people who love
0:24wearing makeup to school personally I i was 14 when i started my youtube channel
0:29on here and I was 14 so I was still in school and i basically around the time i
0:35became 15 I started to obsess with make up more and more so i actually put my
0:42alarm like a half hour earlier to actually play with makeup in the morning
0:46at school I kind of was the girl that had different eye shadows on every
0:50single day and I i saw every day as an experimental day for eyeshadows I see
0:56that today I'm going to do a fresh and easy in-depth back to school makeup look
1:00I'm keeping it
1:02more on the wearable site it's definitely it's i'm wearing makeup
1:06you can tell that i'm wearing makeup this is not a no-makeup makeup look but
1:10i still try to keep it really useful & fresh and glowy and radiant and I I
1:16personally really really like this look if you want to know how to get this
1:19fresh and easy in-depth back to school look there please keep watching
1:24ok the first thing we're going to be doing for the face is priming it I wish
1:28I would have known back in the day what priming was I i did play a lot with
1:34makeup when I was younger and when I was in high school but i never knew what
1:38priming for a face
1:40good deal let's say you have a more dry skin you can prime it by giving it more
1:45moisture and therefore the foundation will look better on top of it
1:50if you have more of an oily skin type you can prime it which fights back the
1:56oils and keeps it at bay for the entire day and your makeup last longer
2:01my skin today is a little bit of a battlefield and it also feels very
2:06drying today so I need something that locks in the moisture that keeps the
2:10moisture in the entire day
2:13plus it has to make the makeup that I put on top last all day long
2:17look beautiful what I find works best for that is my Mac prep and prime
2:21natural radiance in radiant yellow they also have a pink one but I just like
2:25yellow
2:25I'm just going to take a few pumps of that and apply that to my entire face
2:32and just gently rub it in
2:35if you have an oily skin type you might want to add a little bit of makeup
2:39setting spray right now I'm not going to because i find that these can be a bit
2:43trying for information today
2:45i also want to really encourage you guys to not go too far with it we all know
2:51the typical girls you know the popular girls with like pancake faces black kohl
2:57eyeliner inside their eyes and it's six meters below it
3:01spider lashes and awful eyebrows so I really want to urge you guys to not go
3:07too far with your base of course you can pack it up a little bit more if you have
3:12a little bit more of a problem skin but still keep it thin wearable and
3:17traceless is today going to use a BB cream and this is the super plus BB
3:23cream
3:24triple function by skin79 is just the orange be between from skin79 and I'm
3:30going to take it and a . it on my face
3:35now it's safer to first . some of the product onto your face and then buff it
3:44in and then look at what else you need
3:47it's safer to do that instead of you know gunking up the products on your
3:53face and then at the end being like our shit that's way too much
3:57you can definitely apply this with your fingers it saves you time it saves you
4:02money
4:02it's not my preferred technique because i just don't really like using my
4:07fingers for foundation the base
4:09I'm so i'm going to go with a brush this is by Sigma this T flat kabuki f80 brush
4:14and with that I'll go to buff that BB cream in
4:22once that's buffed in its time for concealer
4:26so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a concealer that lasts so long
4:31plus it just gives me an amazing coverage i'm talking about the mac pro
4:35longwear in NC 15 but if you do not have that you can also go for the next HD
4:40photogenic concealer which I really really love this fall and they come in a
4:44bunch of colors but i'm just going to go for the mac one today and you want to
4:48place it underneath your eyes and also in this inner corner right here and i
4:53like to swim a bit up to the the sides of my eyes here
4:58you don't have to do that at all but you can
5:03the option is there and i'll go it's about that in with yet another brush and
5:07that is a sick my f-86 tapered kabuki brush and you just want to start tapping
5:13it in there and defuse that concealer out
5:18ok now what I like to do is set this to make it last all day long so I'm just
5:22going to take a little bit of my favorite powder and i'm going to take a
5:26little tiny teeny brush and I'm just going to lightly set that concealer
5:32underneath my eye and they want to do now is let that foundation rest and
5:37really the sink into my face
5:39so and then do browse and then come back and finish it all off with powder that
5:44way
5:45the front of you can really settle and think into the skin and do its job and
5:50then you can powder it and make it last all day long so I'm going to do browse
5:54now and i'm just going to use my usual products of the brow is by anastasia and
5:58a little bit of dip brow pomade in tok so I'm going to make a mixture of that
6:03and do my brows
6:04I'm going to do that off-camera i have a full tutorial on that if you want to
6:08know how i do them and then we'll be back here one of the most important
6:13things you want to do when it comes to your eyes
6:15it's priming them it's the same as the skin if you want something to last you
6:20want to prime it
6:21there are a bunch of primers to choose from but my favorite is by mac and it's
6:25a pain pot and this is called soft ochre and I like applying this just by taking
6:31my finger
6:32and then just start tapping it onto the lid and wipe any axes off and start
6:38buffing all that you have on your lid in and it's really important to not forget
6:44the bottom part of your eyes ever eyes when I want to be doing is defining them
6:52but not going too far and still having a little bit of glamour because the
6:56glamour is all it lately so we need some lamb up in here and because my eyes are
7:01somewhat smaller and I don't have a lot of crease
7:04I really want some definition in my crease I'll be taking kid
7:08eyeshadow by mac and i'll be applying that softly to my crease so just with a
7:13big blending brush to find your crease just a tad bit more then i take
7:23undercover from the lorac unzipped palette and with that I just love to
7:29highlight i highlight my brow bone with this
7:33so blending it with that kit collar and i also love opening up the inner portion
7:38of my eye
7:40so the inner corners it's just this color works perfectly for that because
7:45it just opens up your eyes and makes you look super super healthy and wide awake
7:49and you know
7:51ready to take them books
7:54now you could stop here because you have that definition in your crease and you
7:58have highlighted so you look a little bit more wide awake but i want to add a
8:02little bit of glam and more definition so i'll be taking a wet and wild trio
8:08and this is called a walking on eggshells and i love these colors right
8:12here so i'm going to make it make sure between the brow bone color and the
8:17eyelid color and just with my finger
8:20i'm going to apply those to my lid meeting up with the crease color that
8:27kid color and i love these colors on the lid because they're still very light
8:32reflective and glam but they're not too much and not too overpowering meaning
8:38that they're perfect for school because you can still look glam without going
8:43too little or too much
8:44for the bottom lash I'm going to take that crease color and I'm just placing
8:49this really closely to the roots of my lower lashes and slightly work my way in
8:56and then for the tiniest bit of a wing / more definition and flirt
9:02I'm going to take that same color and from that lower lashline drag it out so
9:09you have a nice little wing going on and drag it back in to create a wing and
9:16then you just want to create a nice haze around the edges to smoke it in and make
9:24it less harsh and i really like doing this because it gives you the illusion
9:28of a nice wing but it's still very soft wearable and totally okay for school
9:37and lastly you want to apply mascara to really make your I speak and you want to
9:41go top and bottom just to make it look really flirty and nice and young and
9:46fresh
9:47the mascara so i'll be using our makeup studio what a proof 3d an extra black
9:51and i'm also applying a bit of this korean brand mascara this is by holy ,
9:55holy cow i believe and it's the magic pole mascara so i'm going to apply that
10:01to my lashes top and bottom and then it will be back
10:04ok so far cheeks i think the most important thing to remind yourself of is
10:08that less is more when it comes to cheeks and high school
10:13I personally did a little bit of contouring already because my face just
10:17needs contouring I'm and I'm still going to use a little bit of bronzer bronzer
10:21is always a good option it makes you look a warm and healthy and radiant
10:27so a little bit of bronzer is never a bad idea
10:30so I'm going to go with my illamasqua i disobey and i'm just going to focus it
10:34on my forehead tops of my cheekbones and then just kind of make a 3 out of it
10:44so you start at your forehead go to the top of your cheek chin jawline
10:50sorry ok for blush i want to go for something radiant and
10:53happy and healthy and I'm going to go for my mineral eyes blush by Mac called
10:58DNT for that out and put it on the apples of your cheeks and then blending
11:04back for me personally highlighting is a must because I feel like when you go
11:10little on the eyes and you go little on the lips later on and you go little on
11:14the skin
11:15you definitely do want to have their radiant glow and I just think that the
11:19less makeup you wear and the more glow you have the the prettier gets so i'm
11:24going to highlight using my Mac mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle
11:27and the tiniest bit of becca shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone and you want
11:32to focus this on the highest points of your cheekbones right at the side of
11:37your eyes and they would I like to do is take a more concentrated brush and smile
11:43and you kind of see this light reflective thing popping up
11:48you kind of want to highlight there as well underneath your eyes on to the
11:54cheeks because that just makes you look glowy
11:58you have no idea for lips you want to go with something that you can easily throw
12:03in your bag and touch up throughout the day and i'm going to go with my NYX
12:07jumbo eye pencil in 7 17 and it's called Irish coffee and it's just a beautiful
12:14peachy pink color
12:16it's nude but it has a punch of color and it's a little bit of glossy and it's
12:20it just it where it's nicely and it just looks really good on the lips so this
12:25slap it on
12:33and that guy's concludes this in-depth easy back to school fresh makeup
12:38tutorial

2:50actually increasing and i'll be using my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac from this
2:54for this got the first shadow will be using is cork by mac and with a big
3:04fluffy brush
3:06this is used to create definition in my crease and also blending it all the way

5:11and then with a mess because stealing gel and Max tempting eyeshadow i'm going
5:16to make a nice mixture between those two and apply that over top for a nice
5:20Sparkle and that just makes the most beautiful sparkly green brown color
5:31I love it ok now it's time for the liquid liner and as always i'll be using
5:35my country's a liquid liner in dating joe black for this for the line
5:40what you want to do is you want to make the outside corner of the wing a little
5:44bit more sick and you know present there and then the closer you come into the
5:50inner corner
5:51the more precise and thing you want your line to be so this way it gives a really
5:56nice elongated cat eye effect and that is exactly what Arianna was wearing as
6:01well
6:18ok and now it's time to do one of her I jewels that she had right here
6:24now I know that Ariana was having a really nice silver crystal coloured
6:29sequined there
6:31I don't have that believe it or not i do not own one that size
6:35so i'm going to change it up a little bit i really like gold
6:39so I popped a gold a shot right there a circle study around adopt a gold .
6:47Todd and I got it from this wheel right here and i will put a link down below on
6:51where you can get this and the gold dud to stud is right here and i'll be
6:57applying that as my side I jewelry is very easy to apply just apply some glue
7:02or you want it and then you went a q-tip and then really easily you can just pick
7:08one up and place it where you want to
7:14now it's time for some mascara I'm gonna go with my makeup city of what approved
7:17three the in extra black and for lashes of using the mac 36 for cheeks that's
7:23going to be really easy i'm just going to contour and shape out of my face a
7:26little bit more to give me a little bit more of definition because let's be
7:30honest Ariana has the cutest cheeks they're so flush of the wall so with a
7:35little bit of my illamasqua heroin eyeshadow i am just going to sculpt out
7:39with cheeks a little and then to give my completion a really nice warmth and
7:50going with disobey by illamasqua just applying that over top
7:56i'm also applying that as my blush a little bit then for highlighter I want
8:05to go for this amazing new product
8:07this is by college star and this is the twist
8:10ex-l all over a highlighter comes in a little stick like this and this is the
8:17number one beige two hot oh and it's just a stunning champagne rose gold
8:22highlighter
8:23so actually just going to take a bit with
8:26my finger and tap that where I want to highlight and oh my god this is so
8:32gorgeous
8:33oh my god oh god that is stunning
8:39then I'm also padding that down the bridge of my nose and the tip of my nose
8:51Cupid's bow
8:55I love that ok then for those amazing glitter lips I'm first going to line my
9:01lips to give them a little bit more fullness and fall you and that is
9:04definitely what they did on Ariana as well for that i'll be using my lip
9:08contour lip liner by lancome and this is 211
9:13beige rose
9:26and her glittery lips had this really nice I'm soft
9:29Rosie pinky color with a little bit of peach with quite the mix so for that I'm
9:35dabbing on a little bit of lipstick
9:37this is by nicks and this is strawberry milk
9:49so that gives us a nice base color to work with and now for the glitter the
9:53glitters i'll be using our by occ and this is the glitter in pink
9:59very fitting and i'm also going to mix in a little bit of the beige glitter in
10:04the middle so I kind of get this glitter ombre lip going on to make letters
10:08figured something very sticky so I went for the stickiest gloss I could find in
10:13my collection and those are definitely the dazzle glasses by mac and the color
10:18i'll be using today is called the baby Sparks and it has a little bit of that
10:22same colored glitter in there so i figured it's a nice base you want to
10:27remember that wherever you apply the gloss the glitter is going to stick onto
10:31so you want to make this as neat and straight as possible
10:46ok so that is very sticky and porn star if you ask me it's time to pass some
10:51glitter on top

1:24lately
1:26these two right here this is my becca
1:28shimmering skin Perfector in opal and
1:30i'm mixing that with Chanel blah blah
1:32i'm someone told me that is liberal and
1:35LeBlanc so and I like going one pump of
1:39each so one pump of love long and one
1:43pump of becca shimmering skin Perfector
1:45i mix it on my fingers
1:48southall shows all and I just apply it
1:52and then I just start rubbing in
1:54information i want to go for a really
2:00nice traceless foundation that you can't
2:03really detect but it still gives you a
2:05really flawless finish or they'll be
2:06using Mac face and body foundation in c1
2:09and because i want to give them a little
2:10bit more coverage i'm gonna go with my
2:12name
2:13select cover up concealer and this is NW
2:1615 and these together just give you a
2:19really nice flawless foundation without
2:21going too far and then I'm just going to
2:23take some of the foundation and just
2:25tribute it all over my face
2:30that's a distribute and never think
2:33distribute and i'm going to be buffing
2:35this in with my Sigma f80 flat top
2:38kabuki brush to further perfect the face
2:46gonna go with a little bit of concealer
2:47this is max pro longwear in NC 15 and
2:51that's just going underneath my eyes and
2:53on the highest point of my face 24 the
2:55highlight a bit and i'll be doing that
2:58and then with my sigma f 86 tapered
3:08kabuki brush I'm going to buff this in
3:11really easily and really simply and just
3:15what about then
3:16ok 10 be doing is setting this with
3:21powder gonna go with my Chanel natural
3:23loose finish powder in a little time
3:26with Helena hot Claire 20 so i'm going
3:28to do browse and 1i off-camera and then
3:32as always I'll be back
3:33so the first thing I did was a pie base
3:35to my lids to prevent the eyeshadow from
3:37creasing and i use my Mac soft ochre
3:39Paint Pot for this and the first shadow
3:41be using is nylon by Mac what i'll be
3:45doing with nylon is applying this to be
3:49very inner corner of my eyes
3:53also be sure to go right here on the
3:56lower lash line and because christina
3:59also had this color on the inner third
4:01of her lid i'm applying some right there
4:05also
4:08now i'm going to go into this color
4:10right here this is by diamond effects
4:12and this is from the gemstone collection
4:14and this pigment is called Goldstone and
4:17i'm picking some of that up with my
4:19finger and I'm patting it on the outer
4:22half of my lid blending in with nylon
4:26now i'm gonna go into this pigment right
4:28here this is Goldilocks by sugarpill and
4:31mixing this with a little bit of
4:33illamasqua ceiling jail so this is what
4:35my little paste looks like and then you
4:37want to take that with a brush and start
4:41tapping it on between Goldstone and
4:45nylon and softly start blending that in
4:51to give it a really nice diffused blend
4:56and then also of course blend nylon in a
5:00little bit better but just give it a
5:02really nice transition and make it look
5:04really seamless and blended to map out
5:07where my eyeliner to go i'm gonna go in
5:09this black from the softbox etude pellet
5:12and literally all you want to do with
5:15this is a map that eyeliner out for the
5:19other I i did the complete eyeliner with
5:22shadow and when top with the gel liner
5:24now if we take a little closer look at
5:26the other I you want to start off with a
5:28winged liner going all the way up to the
5:30crease i kinda aimed it towards the end
5:33of my eyebrow and then from there you
5:35want to make a cut crease and it starts
5:37up quite thick but it becomes thinner
5:40and thinner once you get to this inner
5:41corner here and they just want to make
5:43your winged liner and just fill this up
5:46and connect the parts and then you want
5:49to do the bottom now it's actually kind
5:51of hard to explain what to do so i'm
5:54just going to show you and speed forward
5:56and I hope then it will be clear
6:01[Music]
6:18[Music]
6:21ok so once you've got the rough shape
6:23you kind of want to add layer upon layer
6:25stroke upon stroke to thicken this part
6:29up here
6:29[Music]
6:40ok now we think is a good time to start
6:44with the gel eyeliner and then i'm going
6:46to use is by Sigma and this is called
6:48wicked and I'm just gonna intensify all
6:52the lines and wherever I feel like it
6:57needs a little bit more i'm just going
6:59to add more you know kind of perfect
7:03shape and then if you want to clean up
7:09the gold part just take a little bit
7:10more of that mixture we made before i'm
7:13just going to read dampen it with my
7:15ceiling gel and then with an eyeliner
7:17brush I'm going to take that mixture and
7:22put it right underneath the black line
7:25and with this you can totally sharpen up
7:29and clean of any mistakes you have made
7:34for the actual eyeliner part across the
7:37lash line going to take my dating joe
7:39black liquid liner by Catrice I wanted
7:41to be quite thick and full because once
7:43you look straight ahead you want to see
7:45nothing but the black and then when you
7:47look down it's like hey I'm gold and
7:54then to connect this part to that part
7:56right here you just want to kind of
7:58raise your eyebrows that this becomes
8:00flat and then from this corner right
8:04here drag it in really feel that up for
8:15the bottom taking the black shadow again
8:17and running it really closely along my
8:21lower lashline and what we're going for
8:24here is that this point right here came
8:26all this way down a kind of want this
8:28align to meet up with it but still not
8:31really connect and meet up you just want
8:33them to know kinda they're missing their
8:36first date so what I'm going to do with
8:38the eyeshadow again is sort of create a
8:41new lower lash line like that and now
8:49you want to pick it up a little bit
8:52ok now we want to create this little
8:57wing right here and that's really easy
8:59to do again take that black eyeshadow
9:01and simply from here create a second
9:10wing and then you just want to connect
9:12it to that bottom
9:17ok i'll be taking this hourglass 1.5
9:24millimeter mechanical gel liner and
9:27going to line my waterline with this
9:29still about half way in and it's super
9:33super pigmented it goes on very easily
9:37and it lasts like a mother fucking rock
9:42the time finally has come for mascara
9:44and lashes and for mascara i'll be using
9:46my waterproof 3d extra black buy makeup
9:50studio and for lashes I'm gonna go with
9:53EXO beauties feline lashes for the top
9:59top portion and for low relations I'm
10:02gonna go with Max 33 i believe and just
10:06pop those on the lower lash line because
10:08she christina was rocking some very bold
10:12lower lashes so i'm going to do that
10:13right now off-camera to skip ahead and
10:16just save some time and then we'll be
10:18back i'm gonna give my face a little bit
10:20more definition by contouring it and the
10:23the products i'll be using for that is
10:25biometrika and this is my eyeshadow in
10:28her own wooden someone requested it that
10:31i should say it like i detoxed it in
10:34RuPaul's Drag Race so the duct sculpt

10:47Brown sup and warm and just really warm
10:51and intense in those shots where she was
10:53like yeah so to warm a complexion I'm
10:55gonna go with a bourgeois bronzing
10:58powder and it looks like a little
11:00chocolate and this is called runs and

4:15naked 3 palette and taking the lightest
4:17color right here and I'm packing the
4:19shade all over the lid up to the crease
4:26and then i'm also with this going to
4:29light of my inner corners and this to
4:32really open up the eyes later on and
4:35taking that strange color from the Urban
4:38Decay Naked 3 only they're really
4:41putting that on the inner corner and can
4:47see how much that brightens up the
4:49entire eye area i love it i'm going to
4:52take strange again and concentrated on
4:57my brow bone and blend out softly now
5:04it's time for the pink eyeliner and
5:05because i didn't have one going to go
5:07with a lip liner and this is max embrace
5:10me this is a lip pencil but it does the
5:13job
5:13you don't have to go and buy out a
5:15liquid pink liner for this especially
5:17because let's be honest how many times
5:19are we going to wear this look outside
5:21so it's really important to keep the tip
5:24of the pencil really fine and sharp so
5:26keep you know sharpening it i'm going to
5:29start off with my first line and then
5:36from there go back on to the lid and
5:42this pink liner can be very thick and
5:46dramatic because recovering it up with a
5:48little bit of black later on as well to
5:51sort of set to look a little bit more so
5:54you can make this really thick
6:00and even when going to the inner corner
6:02even that inner corner has to be applied
6:08a very thickly
6:19and i'm going to take the Urban Decay
6:20electric palette and i'll be picking up
6:23a little bit of savage and with a really
6:25sharp and precise angled brush I'm going
6:29to go over the pencil to set it and
6:33intensify it so this way you won't get
6:36any transfer and also with this you can
6:41go ahead and even out and sharpen out
6:44any lines that you feel have to be even
6:47out and sharpen out you can go ahead and
6:49really get that flick in there and make
6:54it super precise and thin and what I
6:58especially love doing with this is even
7:01that wing out even more now before I
7:06focus on the black eyeliner right here i
7:08want to focus a little bit more on that
7:10line in the crease this is very peppy
7:13and graphic at the same time and i love
7:16that they did this so I'm going to go
7:17back into my saltbox pellet and i'll be
7:21taking this gray color right here so you
7:23just want to follow the shape of your
7:25eye
7:26this goes like that that goes like that
7:28it has a curve here it has a curve here
7:31it goes out straight like that goes out
7:34straight like that you do want to look
7:36straight into a mirror when doing this
7:38because you don't want to play too too
7:39high or too low but you do want to go a
7:41little bit above your natural crease so
7:43that when you look straight forward
7:45it's a little bit higher up
8:04ok now going to do the black line right
8:07here you want to keep it shorter thinner
8:09and nastier than the pink one on the
8:12outside wing you definitely want to meet
8:14the black with the pink but not as long
8:16as the pink and just overall keep it
8:18thinner and shorter and the Islander
8:20amusing is dating Joe Black by Catrice
8:45ok then i'm going to go back into that
8:46gray color from the sauce box a tude

12:21guys so much for watching again and
12:23hopefully I will see you guys on the
12:25next one
0:00hey guys welcome back to mastering the art of today we're going to talk about
0:04you guessed it
0:05cushion compact everything you need to know about which is the best cushion to
0:09look for the best color for your skin type and the best techniques have fun
0:12and of course good luck don't worry if you're new to cushion compacts
0:17here's a quick one on one they originated from Korea and normally they
0:20provide a lightweight sheer coverage the packaging as you can see here is bulkier
0:24than your average compact because it has to create an airtight seal to keep your
0:29cushion fresh
0:30if you look inside you'll find an applicator which is usually a dense
0:33antibacterial circular sponge like this in a porous sponge that soaks in
0:38foundation BB or CC cream
0:40here's my favorite pro tip just like how you're flipping the matches to turn the
0:44bed
0:44flip the sponge when the product starts to run low it's kind of like go on up
0:48for the sponge
0:49the application is pretty universal all you have to do is load the applicator
0:53sponge and start blogging onto the skin in small even paths
0:57choosing the right cushion compact all comes down to selecting the right finish
1:00and coverage for your skin tone and type if you have fair skin then you know the
1:05struggle of finding product that matches your complexion
1:08when I say fair I mean skin that is paler than a ghost
1:12so pale that your face is naturally blown out in flash photos but it's all
1:16good because those of you with fair skin have a decent range of brands to choose
1:19from many of my favorites are from South Korea
1:24if you have a light to medium 10 skin town you have a lot of options to play
1:28with a lot of the Korean brands will carry only a few shades that generally
1:33fall in the light to medium skin tones
1:35here are some of my favorite brands to check out
1:38because cushion compact is relatively new and face makeup
1:42unfortunately shade range is limited but there are brands who carry shades for
1:48deeper tones cushions are also available in color correction shade yellow helps
1:53with discoloration purple combats dullness peach brightens dark circles
1:57and green neutralizes redness
2:00now we can move on to recommendations for different skin types when selecting
2:04the cushion compact for dry skin instead of finding one that is foundation based
2:08look for one that is BB or CC cream based for application use a good
2:12moisturizer and hydrating primer
2:14you can even spray a moisturizing toner on your application sponge before
2:18applying in order to keep your skin hydrated and the foundation from
2:22settling into fine lines from here
2:24just continue building your desired coverage by adding thin layers i
2:28recommend pressing and lifting like this to avoid streaks and dry patches here
2:32are some of my pics for dry skin
2:35when it comes to selecting the cushion compact for combination skin you have a
2:40wider range to choose from since you can tolerate compacts for dry and oily skin
2:44for application
2:45start by applying your cushion compact around your jawline and cheeks building
2:49coverage as you go from there
2:51damn around the t-zone area with the Beauty Blender in order to avoid build
2:55up and once you're done immediately set this area with powder for a flawless
2:59finish
3:00here are some bread that you can try out for combination skin
3:04if you have oily skin be aware that cushion compact are not the best choice
3:08because of their duty finishes
3:10no worries though there are cushion compact for you just try and find one
3:14that has a mattifying or satin finish
3:16stay away from the ones with hydrating benefits and look for one that has a
3:19lightweight formula when it comes to application
3:22start by using your favorite mattifying prime something like milk of magnesia
3:26that will soak up the oil on your t-zone and keep him at throughout the day after
3:30building your desired coverage finish off with a mattifying spray and apply
3:34translucent or mattifying powder to keep your skin looking fresh
3:38here are my recommendations for oily skin both acne in mature skin are
3:44grouped together here because both types require extra attention
3:47the trick is to keep your skin balance you want to look for cushion compacts
3:51with added skincare benefits and stay away from heavy formulas with harsher
3:55ingredients for application start with the primer to help smooth out fine lines
4:00or blemishes
4:01from here you can apply with a damp sponge to avoid excess product in fine
4:05lines be sure that you're applying in thin layers because most of the formulas
4:09are sheer you may have to touch up with a spot concealer unblemished areas
4:15yeah
4:15once you're done with the application finish off the hydrating setting missed
4:19and here are some brand recommendations
4:24oh and special thanks to everyone who was in this video we decided to show up

1:03I'm going to stain my lips with the deep berry color my lips tend to get dr very
1:08easily so this lip balm will also help moisturize my lips from the chili dry
1:13air a nice day like this is actually a great way to get acquainted with the
1:18dark lip color
1:19moving on to the brows i'm going to use here this brow gel from make up forever

1:30here that every stroke I make I'm spreading the product out what i'm doing
1:34here is reshaping my brows and you can reshape them into any brow shape you
1:38like for this look I decided to keep my brows straight and full with a very
1:43minimal arch this will give me a more sophisticated look
1:47if you look at actresses like natalie portman jennifer connelly Audrey Hepburn
1:51and even Lily Collins
1:53they tend to sport a strong set of fuller straighter browse and you can see

2:53pick up the same peachy pink color and apply this along the lower lash line

1:14let's do lose take your face primer and evenly apply this all over your face to
1:20smooth it out
1:22now it's time to conceal any blemishes and dark circles
1:27usually I like to use a fluffy contour brush to apply my concealer on this way
1:31it actually creates a beautiful airbrush finish
1:35so start around the eyes and move out to the rest of the face to even it out
1:39ok
1:42and don't forget to powder up to keep your makeup lasting all into the night
1:48time

2:54bullet use a lip brush the brush will help get the product on your lips really
2:59a brush kits you better precision

0:36k-pop stars are known for having their sexy cat eyes so it's really important
0:41that your eyeliner is very very black

0:48for the lashes you want to call them and apply generous coats of volumizing
0:53mascara and here i'm using the bomb
0:56what's your type bodybuilder mascara and i decided to add a straight line on my
1:00lower lash line to create an edgy look avoid wearing bold eye shadow colors
1:05kpopstarz usually prefer to sport eyeliner however if you need to add more

1:10glitter is your best friend if you want more drama to your eyes at fake lashes
1:15and now you're kpop is done and now that your eyes are dying
1:19it's time to show your face in love you want to start off by using BB cream

1:26combination of tinted moisturizer
1:28Sarah and primer k-pop stars are all about perfecting the skin so it's
1:33important to create a flawless face here i'm going to use Coastal Scents
1:37concealer palette
1:38I want to cover up my dark circles which I actually got from lack of sleep
1:43make sure you're getting sleep now i'm going to highlight the rest of my face
1:48then with a sponge blend everything away

2:03attention to my eyes
2:04now take your face powder and modify your face you'll notice that i'm
2:08skipping blush and bronzer because it's actually not really needed
2:11k-pop artists usually prefer bright looking skin
2:15now for the most important step creating the famous kpop eyebrows
2:20I really love this brow look because it really reminds me about your helper you
2:24want to create folder looking brows with minimal arch the straighter the better
2:29also you don't want your brow link to be too long
2:32keep it short the full your brows and more youthful you look almost done guys
2:36time for the lips here i have three different marinus lip balm glossy
2:40lacquer stains to choose from a red rose pink and white piece
2:44these are actually colors that k-pop stars would rock I decided to choose the
2:48rose pink color
2:50remember to avoid any dark lips takes like plums deep browns and dark berries
2:54also stick with the lip finish that doesn't have any glitter or pearl
2:59texture
3:00you're finished should either have a matte glossy or satin finish
3:04when it comes to kpop fashion it's all about the accessories
3:08I decided for a glitzy look for this one and of course you can wear black
3:12but I would look for tops with interesting cutouts remember try and
3:15keep it family friendly
3:16no low-cut tops you don't want to show an evil twins if you want rocker crazy
3:21jacket look for something metallic shiny the edge here the better when it comes
3:27to hair
3:27you can never go wrong with straight hair but you want to go all out
3:31rock the bang
3:34my dear friend theater here is clipping on fake fringes for me

4:11skin
4:12no bronzer no blush no crazy colored eye shadows in their fashion matches with
4:17the theme of their songs
4:22and now it's time for the guys let's turn them into kpop stars
4:27this look is actually inspired by the boy band TVXQ i would recommend going
4:31two to three shades lighter and just skip the bronzer and contouring it's not
4:35need to tear for the brows same thing straight in a little angled if his brows
4:40are super dark and jet-black try and lighten them just a bit for the eyes
4:45just apply eyeliner on the bottom part you basically just want to create a cat
4:49liner on the lower lash line when it comes to his hair keep it straight Matt
4:54if you really need to just use reference photos if your favorite k-pop stars
4:58if he doesn't have his ears pierced try clip on earrings and now your boy band k
5:03public is done to really complete this look
5:06try and learn the TVXQ catch me help you
5:38you wanna know
5:55yeah
6:02have fun and good luck
6:05and don't forget to check out if see com
0:00seductive look is inspired by the lax brought to life by the flamenco dancers
0:10of Spain fierce in passionate like a row center thorns
0:15this is the spanish
0:22we all know that every great masterpiece begins with a flawless canvas
0:26let's begin by applying a lightweight CC cream which will smooth and hydrate your
0:31skin if you're looking for a sheer natural coverage cc or BB cream is the
0:37way to go
0:38just blend everything away with your clean fingers and let's move on
0:43see this concealer i made this so that you can cover up anything
0:48hence the name because BB and CC creams are so sure it might not be able to
0:53cover up dark circles or smaller skin blemishes
0:56so that's why spot treating these little imperfections with your concealer is so
1:00crucial
1:01you can either use your clean fingers or a brush to blend the concealer
1:06notice how I'm making this dabbing motion instead of dragging the brush to
1:10blend dab instead you'll notice the concealer blames faster and it's more
1:15gentle on the skin
1:19unless your foundation and concealer has a powder finish set everything with a
1:24translucent loose powder the powder will keep the makeup lasting longer anything
1:30within a Molly and texture will move increase into your fine lines and that's
1:34why powder will prevent this from happening
1:37and before moving on to the eyes just apply a little bit of attempted red lip
1:43balm which will help moisturize your lips so they're primed and ready for
1:46lipstick
1:47cool time for the fun part the eyes start with the metallic purple color on
1:53the center of the lid if you look closely the shade has many dimensions to
1:58it which will complement the other purple and gold colors that we're going
2:02to be applying later
2:05we call this dual chrome next use a shadow brush and apply a light wash of
2:11this pale lavender shade across the lids blending as you go
2:15do you see the dabbing motion again you have more control if you doubt the
2:18eyeshadow on instead of brushing it on pick up this / lavender color and accent
2:25the inner corner of the eyes
2:26this will give your eyes at hint of pastel color it's time to shadow in the
2:31bottom lashline pick up this metallic berry shade and bring the color up along
2:36the lower lash line and into the eye socket to create definition and
2:40dimension
2:41if you want a romantic smokey look build up the color intensity don't just tackle
2:47it on
2:47it's all about layering and creating a very slow buildup
2:51you'll have more control this way and just blend the contour shade so that it
2:55doesn't have a hard edge
3:05to really make your eyes appear fiery and alive
3:09take a sparkling blue shadow and gold and line the bottom lash line from the
3:13inner corner to the middle of the eye
3:15doing this will give your eyes that multifaceted look so every time you move
3:19the shadow will change with the light
3:24lastly use the light purple shadow on the brow bone which will blend away any
3:28harsh lines and create that hazy school on to effect because this look is bold
3:36and adventurous your liner should mirror that so don't be shy
3:40before beginning make sure your liner is sharpened for more precision when lining
3:46you also want to make sure that your black liner has a more creamy texture
3:50not the hard pencil one because we are going to lunge this baby up
3:55start at the outer corner of your eyes and work your way in and don't forget to
4:02line the water line to help intensify the look with the smudger brush or if
4:06you have the water liner pencil flip it over and use the smudger tool smudge the
4:10eyeliner would do so gently
4:12don't drag it on your eyes try and use a gentle patting motion keep doing it
4:17until you get this smoky effect
4:20no black eyeshadow needed just a creamy black eyeliner
4:24cool all right onto the brows I like to use to brow pencils to create my natural
4:29brow look
4:30and the reason being is because your brow hairs are made up of so many
4:33different colors and I like to keep the lighter color along the head of my brows
4:38and a darker color along the tale of my brows so fill in your brows and cover up
4:43any sparse areas
4:47honestly the brows are the most important step to any of their makeup
4:52routine so don't skip this step
4:54unless you have perfectly shaped browse lucky you
5:02now grab your mascara and go to town the more coats the better
5:06and if you need to add fake lashes we want sky-high lashes so that every time
5:11you blink
5:11it's like a gust of wind blowing away
5:15yeah
5:26now your eyes are perfect
5:31yeah
5:36to create sensual looking skin
5:40try using a skin illuminator the one that i'm using here is called golden
5:44hour
5:44so look for where the natural light hits your cheekbones and apply the
5:47illuminator around this area when it comes to creating the illusion of good
5:52skin
5:52it's all about texture and light so the more light you bring onto your face the
5:57more your club but not too much
5:59you don't want to look like a light bulb
6:03you can see how do we and healthy my skin looks now all make it my dear
6:08he had a screw an Italian art term that means light and shade and that's what
6:14we're going to be doing here
6:16use the shadow to contour the areas on your face that you want to recede
6:20I like to contour the sides of my nose to elevate it
6:23if you want to contour properly you have to find the right color and texture
6:27it has to be a neutral medium brown shade and the texture has to be Matt
6:31this will give you the most natural look
6:34once you've mapped out your face just blend wait I wanted to make sure that
6:38this formula blends effortlessly
6:40no brush or sponge needed just your warm clean fingers see how you look with
6:46subtle and intense contouring
6:49you'll never know how you look until you try and unlike contouring highlighting
6:56is when you want to make features on your face stand out so I'm gonna do this
7:01on the bridge of my nose
7:11now it's time to create your kiss of fire a bold red lip is one of the most
7:16powerful iconic beauty look that anyone can rock
7:19you just have to find the right shape that fits your undertone best or you can
7:22customize and build your own color if you have a cooler undertone find a Red
7:27that has a blue tone in it
7:28if you have a yellow undertone find a way that has a warmer toning and if
7:33you're not really sure
7:34a neutral red color is usually the safest bet you want better precision use
7:39a brush when you're applying your red lipstick so that you can paint on your
7:43perfectly sculpted red lips

8:26don't forget to check out my makeup line and at em cosmetics calm and my blog
8:33updated daily at Michelle Phan com
0:00what's that majestic human
0:07I always believed how a new year is kind of like a blank canvas
0:13and I like to celebrate this idea by enhancing my favorite features the clean
0:17and fresh beauty look anyone of all ages can wear this look
0:22let's begin with a clean canvas before I attack my face of makeup
0:28I always like to start with a clean face to remove makeup residue use a makeup
0:34wipe to reveal is squeaky clean surface if you prefer using a non oil based
0:39makeup remover chlorine makes one that's enriched with corn flower extract i know
0:44not everyone has five minutes to spare
0:47but if you do show your face in love by nurturing it
0:50the deep hydrating mask stress can tire the body and it reflects on the face
0:56so finding any bit of relaxation helps and substituting a traditional
1:02moisturizer for dewy skin missed instead my favorite one by tata acts like a
1:07primer and illuminator it helps reduce any dry patches on my skin
1:11try not to neglect your lips especially if you're wearing a lot of liquid
1:16lipsticks many can be drawing so be sure to exfoliate your lips from time to time
1:21mmm this sugar lips crab tastes pretty good
1:25ok finally we can begin with makeup I like to use concealer first and spot
1:29treat any blemishes quality concealers are hard to come by when you do a little
1:34goes a long way
1:36spot treat and gently Pat like this to blend from there
1:40I like to even out the area around my nose and mouth because of excess redness
1:44moving onto the ice
1:47load up your brush with a light camel color and begin making a subtle pseudo
1:52cut crease
1:53try not to create a harsh line like a traditional countries make it feathery
1:59take a mat charcoal color loaded up with a tiny angled brush get close to your
2:05eyes
2:06notice how this gives an illusion of a thicker lash line when doing this
2:11just be sure to use a light hand with the same brush begin to feather out the
2:16darker color along your lash line sweep it out into a wing
2:20this will help elongate the shape of your eyes so from here
2:23just grab more color and begin to intensify the wing taking your time in
2:27starting lightly allows you to build up the intensity in layers now using a
2:32small eyeshadow brush loaded up with a warm earth tone shadow and begin to line
2:37the lower lash line like this
2:39I know this beauty style looks pretty simple but you'd be surprised the most
2:45simple and natural looks actually require the most time because of the
2:48blending layering and feathering and once you're done just blend it out with
2:52a fluffy brush
2:55yes there is such a thing as a sailor moon liquid eyeliner and I have to say
3:01it's one of my favorite liners
3:03i'm going to use this one over the previous eyeliner to sharpen line begin
3:08tapering out the line
3:09little by little to create a tapered . this will provide the most line control
3:14giving you the perfect wing
3:16ok let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the wraps
3:20first I'm going to use a powder to create the base for my brow shape if you
3:26wanted to look natural
3:27the powder finish should be mat from here
3:30I like to layer a pencil over creating hairlike strokes make feathery marks
3:35like so and blur the lines by combing is glee through your brows using your
3:40favorite lash curler my holy grail issues
3:43press firmly against the roots of your lashes and trying to pinch yourself
3:48keep pressing from root to tip to get the best holding curl
3:52all right now you can tight line your eyes using a warm brown eyeliner the
4:00definition it gives goes well with the color you already placed on your lower
4:04lash line
4:05now you can fuck up your lashes with generous coats of mascara
4:09I know for some people the idea of sweeping mascara through the lashes
4:13seems terrifying but honestly for me every time I swipe
4:18it's such a satisfying feeling i know im so weird
4:22so I found the best full lashes for Asian eyes they're called diamond lash
4:26and i discovered them in Tokyo
4:27first off the reason why they're so amazing is because they're super easy to
4:31peel off and I don't have to cut down the link
4:33the band is super thin and it fits perfectly for Asian eyelids
4:38BAM look how natural this looks okay once your lashes are set
4:42give them one more curl to get them all perky and excited and now you got some
4:46body lashes
4:47I like to powder when i'm almost done with the makeup because it helps
4:51maintain the freshman's look at how pretty this gradient blushes
4:59it's not your basic blush color but it's wearable watch use a brush or contour
5:04brush and sweep it back and forth to load it up with the color pop this on to
5:07your cheeks I softly blending out towards your temple
5:10all right you should be a magical now but if you're craving more dimension
5:14lightly contour use a matte neutral bronzer in the hollows of your cheeks
5:18and dust the rest around your upper hairline to balance out the face
5:22I was done finish off the look with the sultry path
5:28profit with lip liner if needed and top it off with a gradation liquid lipstick
5:36all right now you're done enjoy your body self love you
5:42good luck
5:55yeah
0:00hi need help on doing makeup for pictures
0:03no worries because i'm here to help
0:06before anything
0:10apply lip balm on your lips to get them nice and moisturized
0:18let's move on to sense came to avoid that white cast look you know when your
0:23face is white and the rest of your body is normal tone you want to use a
0:27chemical sunscreen instead of a physical sunscreen basically avoid using a
0:31sunscreen with titanium dioxide and or zinc oxide select a photo friendly
0:36foundation basically a foundation with low SPF anything below spf20 should be
0:42fine because again it won't leave your face with that white cast as you guys
0:47can see I have a little bit of redness going on my skin
0:50so I'm going to use this mint green cover stick from Maybelline what it's
0:54going to do is that it's going to neutralize the redness on my skin
0:57I know it's a little weird kind of like I'm turning myself into the Wicked Witch
1:00of the West but as you guys know green and red are complementary colors they
1:05neutralize each other out so that when you apply foundation concealer on top of
1:09the mint green color
1:10you won't see any redness
1:13yeah
1:21and as you guys can see my skin looks even to combat zombie eyes just add a
1:27little bit of concealer around your eye area with your ring finger
1:31maybe we shall try and sleep a little more if we don't want RBIs for the face
1:34i'm going to use a matte powder to set my makeup i'm going to start around my
1:38under eye area and then move towards the rest of my face
1:44kylie i know it's safe
1:48no we don't
1:49with using a white or nude matte eyeshadow loaded on your finger and make
1:54a stroke on the bridge of your nose then blend away sometimes
1:58shimmer can make your face look like it's a little oily we want to try and
2:01keep your entire makeup as mad as possible
2:04all right now it's time for eyeshadows I'm going to stick with the good old
2:07foolproof neutral eyeshadow palette you first want to use the new color as your
2:11base color apply it on your legs with a brush to clean finger
2:21next step use a matte taupe color as a contour shade and then blend away
2:27taupe is a wonderful color to use if you want to come to your eyes without making
2:31it look too happy
2:33never
2:37be
2:41now take a white eyeshadow or pencil and highlight the inner corners of your eyes
2:46this will open up your eyes more you know photograph beautifully
2:51yeah
2:53yeah
2:54take a black eye shadow and line your eyes keep the line as soft as possible
3:00who
3:08and if you want add lower lashes to create an illusion of bigger eyes
3:17so now we can layer a liquid liner on top of the soft I later that you just
3:21made
3:22keep the line as thin as possible
3:26what
3:29yeah
3:30with the eyeliner done you can now curl your lashes and get them nice and perky
3:34for mascara
3:36add as many coats of mascara as you need
3:40personally I need extra help so I'm going to use fake lashes to add more
3:44drama to my eyes find fake lashes that go with your eye shape
3:48thumbs up if you guys would like me to do a video on finding the right fake
3:51lashes for your eyes
3:52the thing about love isn't love side
3:55come
3:56we're almost done with the eyes all you have to do is just fill in your brows
4:00I decided for this look I wanted my brows to look fuller
4:03I find that when I have fuller browse I tend to look more youthful and sweet is
4:09this true human
4:12you want
4:13and don't forget to use brow gel this will keep the stray hairs in place
4:19yeah
4:19just let alone
4:21yeah
4:23I kind of like to do a little picture test around this time just to see how
4:27I'm doing and I decided to Instagram is too
4:29I noticed from the photo that my nose lacked a little bit of definition so i
4:34decided to contour it by shading the sides of my nose with a matte bronzer or
4:38taupe eyeshadow
4:43perfect and now it's time for blush and bronzer
4:49contour cheeks and add extra color to them because in flash photography
4:53it can sometimes remove twenty percent of color and intensity from your makeup
4:58usually when i'm doing makeup for flash photography I like to use a heavier hand
5:02for the lips
5:03I decided to line my lips for fuller looking smile yes we're almost done just
5:08finish off with the lip color of your choice
5:10I decided to mix up my own color a nude pink shade
5:15well
5:18and now that my face is done i'm going to finish off this look with the hair
5:22braid one side of your hair like this
5:25any braids will do for me is a little lazy i'm just going to stick with the
5:29traditional raid
5:31yeah
5:38and when you're done reading just tuck it in the back and take a bobby pin and
5:42pin it in place
5:46that's it I know it's super easy right
5:52here are some extra tips if your eyes get red before the photoshoot use eye
5:57drops
5:57this will make your eyes appear brighter refreshing oil blotting sheets are a
6:03must before you take that photo blog any excess oil instead of powdering your
6:08face
6:08you don't want to over mattify your face or else your face will lack definition
6:12for me I like to stay away from dangling earrings because it can shorten the
6:17length of my neck
6:18small earrings like these are cute and will always be in fashion
6:22mmm what to wear since most likely you'll be photographed from the waist up
6:27Lucas more around this area maybe you can try and find a pretty neckline or
6:31play around fun colors
6:39and if you're wearing glasses make sure they're non-reflective
6:46and there's nothing wrong with keeping it casual
6:55intricate necklines are great if you want to bold luck and if you want more
6:59focus on your lower neck area where a scoop neckline with fun patterns
7:03this will open up your neckline or maybe you can start for that
7:06scarves are so fun to wear perhaps you're feeling a little edgy
7:11don't be afraid of spikes hopefully you won't get in trouble for wearing this
7:14because it could actually hurt someone
7:16and I'll also be doing a DIY video and how to spike up your jacket
7:20the next video will be about posing for the camera and finding your best angle

0:59get it seemed to sample it in the glam bag
1:02all you have to do is apply this product on your face and you'll notice right
1:05away your dead skin peeling off the kind of look like a racer crumbs weird and
1:10kind of gross but it pays off from here just rinse your face and now touch your
1:15skin
1:16it should feel baby butt smooth this is my favorite hydrating skin missed
1:20no joke I wasn't paid to see any of this this dewy skin mist has saved my skin
1:25because it's so dry in LA after a few good sprays my skin instantly looks and
1:31feel supple
1:33for this look I decided to go for straight brows with no arch so that
1:39means i'm going to cover up the corners of my brows
1:42i'm just going to use concealer but i recommend using either non-toxic glue
1:45stick or spirit gum with wax for a more realistic look
1:50however for the sake of this tutorial and me not wanting to remove the glue
1:54from my brows
1:55I'm just going to opt for concealer you guys get the picture for my brows
1:59i'm applying a soft mix of hazel and dark brown matte shade with an angled
2:04small brush draw a straight edge using the inner corners as a guide
2:08I'm tapering line upwards this will create an illusion of the lifted face
2:13for your eyes warm up some concealer between your fingers and use it as an
2:20eyeshadow base use loose final powder on a fluffy brush to set the concealer on
2:30your lids
2:32this will reduce any creasing using the same brush apply a dark brown color to
2:39the outer corner
2:40increase using a window wiper motion you can create a lot of depth and dimension
2:45with just one that color
2:47it's all about layering and how hard or light or application pressure is now
2:52with a metallic burgundy eyeshadow and using a small shadow brush pack this
2:56color onto your outer eyelid you want to concentrate the color as close to your
3:01lash line as possible to create more depth using a tightly packed blending
3:05brush blend out with the darkest color extending it to the crease and right
3:10underneath the eye from there
3:12find a warm tan color and blend this color under your eyes to balance them
3:16out with the same burgundy color accentuate the corner of the under eye
3:21and from there to sweep the shadow into a tight wing using the fine details
3:28angle brush
3:33get your wing just the way you want it
3:36and once you've sculpted out the shape you like clean the edges with a makeup
3:40brush for that precise edge
3:42ok let's take a break from the eyes onto the face
3:46take a rose gold cream shimmer and lightly Pat onto the apples of your
3:52cheeks for that base glow and from there
3:55using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream spot rate your face to reduce
4:00redness or blemishes
4:02so that your skin tone is even and natural-looking if you're more into that
4:06poreless flawless face find a foundation that has a high coverage if you're like
4:10me and you prefer a natural skin finish use a BB or CC cream that has a light to
4:15medium coverage
4:16apply a light hydrating lip gloss and let it soak into prep your lips with the
4:21same loose powder from before using a smaller face brush loaded up and feather
4:26over any shiny area
4:28okay now back to the eyes using your favorite eyeliner pencil or any liner
4:32that has a small brush sharpen the wing and line the eyes
4:36one trick that I like to use is to start at the inner edge of the line and apply
4:40in small strokes keeping the liner angles and pressing it up against the
4:45side this will easily give you the thinnest line imaginable for the outer
4:49corner wing it out by outlining first and then fill it in
4:56with a gold cream pigment apply a tiny amount using the small detailed brush on
5:02the inner corners and bottom lower lash line from there
5:06just blended together by using the same color to illuminate your upper lid
5:10i'm going to use this nifty product from Korea it's a dual ended stick to give
5:14yourself puffy eyes or a go sell in Korean literally means charming skin
5:19first step
5:20a few millimeters under your natural lower lash line draw a line with the top
5:24grin from there
5:26flip the pen over and use the shimmering white side carefully . between the line
5:30and just true
5:31it's kind of crazy what a little bit of taupe and shimmer can do as if you need
5:35to make your eyes any bigger
5:37but if you want to give her lashes a good curl and apply generous coats of
5:41mascara i chose one that has long bristles so that I could literally comb
5:46through my lashes to separate them
5:48if your brows are needing to be tamed use a brow gel to sculpt them in shape
5:52this tiny one here is by benefit and it's perfect for travel and it has
5:56fibers in it to give the appearance of actual brow hairs
6:00moving on using a light pearlescent cream shadow added to the inner part of
6:05your upper cheek bones for that highlight action
6:07this will make your cheeks appear fuller and we'll give you a more youthful
6:11appearance
6:12now it's time for the lips to prep them and prevent any lipstick from leading
6:17outline them with a lip liner similar to your lip color and with your favorite
6:24peachy nude lipstick apply this on your lips
6:27patting it on with your finger to get rid of any excess residue
6:31if a peach nude is too basic for you go crazy with the new bold lip color this
6:36liquid lipstick from jeffree star is super fun and hydrating formula stays
6:41put
6:41all day just make sure to carefully apply in little strokes and don't forget
6:45the sides of your mouth and in between your lips
6:48it doesn't matter what lip or makeup you decide to go with
6:52just make sure to wear it confidently because makeup is an expression of one
6:56of your many side
6:58express confidently and of course good luck
7:02yeah
7:12yeah
7:24yeah
0:00you
0:14I always believed that we as people are multifaceted beings
0:20there's a part of me that loves darkness I feel like I can hide in the shadows
0:25and disappear like a mystery
0:28I know it's cheesy but this is my alter ego you want to start off by pulling
0:33your hair back and using a cleansing wipe to get rid of any excess makeup
0:37dirt and oil on your face
0:39we want to start with a clean canvas as the temperature gets colder
0:46your skin's natural layer of moisture tends to dry out
0:49you can get rid of any flaky dry patches by using a microdermabrasion skin
0:54exfoliant warm it up in your hands and want the product onto your skin using a
0:59circular motion and once you're done just rinse it off your skin should look
1:03and feel polish after us Foley eight try to moisturize your skin or else it's
1:08gonna feel really dry and stiff you want to find a hydrating moisture mask to
1:13soothe your skin and now that your face is hydrated do the same on your lips
1:19coconut is a natural humectant which means it will help draw moisture in and
1:24keep your lips a little longer
1:26coconut is life all right moving on
1:30start taking those brows using a quality slanted tweezer try not to go overboard
1:35because you want your brows to stay full and natural-looking allow for some time
1:40before going out because there might be redness from the plucking
1:46using a cream highlighter apply this to the tops of your cheekbones you want to
1:50do this under your base to give your skin a natural do we look if you want to
1:54look younger
1:55a dewy complexion will help get you there one of my top three favorite
1:59cushion compact is by I obey this compact is called the six-second compact
2:04as they say one is sold every six seconds
2:08I wasn't paid to say that true fact the cushion applicator provides a light
2:12feathery coverage that will cling to any imperfections
2:16you don't really need to cover your entire face just patri your face until
2:19redness and blemishes or less noticeable
2:22all right now it's time to break out your favorite concealer so i've been
2:25using this cushion concealer and at first I didn't think i would like it but
2:29now I kind of use it for everything
2:32concealing and highlighting for this one you can use it under your eyes as well
2:36as other dark spots on your face such as blemishes and the areas around your nose
2:41and mouth
2:42so just blend out your concealer until it looks natural
2:47now it's time to set your face by stippling once and press powder
2:50I have right here this doll 10cc powder it's pretty unique because it has green
2:55and pink be even any imperfections and discolorations on the skin
3:00what's nice about it is that it doesn't have a Kiki finish before you buy any
3:04powder read reviews or test it out to make sure it's not chalky the powder
3:08should look and feel silky and refined
3:13find a dark cream eye color like a deep tongue or burgundy and warming up
3:18between your fingers when I only have five minutes to do a smokey eye
3:22this is my go-to method apply a dark cream eyeshadow or eyeliner directly on
3:27your eyelid lightly with your ring finger
3:30if you want more precision use your pinky finger keep dabbing to blend the
3:33shadow the murray blend the smokier and softer it look so now with your favorite
3:39pencil liner and using the back of a tweezer to hold the island in place
3:43create small strokes like this along your waterline
3:47personally I think this is the easiest way to apply eyeliner
3:50it's pretty much full proof and provides a nice smoky effect for more precision
3:55you can take a stiff angled brush to create that wing see you'll be a master
4:01at the smoky eye in no time
4:02tight lining is when you apply liner into the rim of your upper and lower
4:06lash line
4:07it feels kind of weird at first and your eyes might water but you kind of get
4:11used to it
4:12oh the things we do for beauty use a black felt-tip eyeliner to punctuate the
4:17shape and intensity of the wing
4:20perfect on my lazy days which I have a lot of i skip eyelash curling
4:27however it's useful for opening up your eyes unless you have naturally curly
4:31eyelashes and lucky
4:35when applying mascara to your upper lashes look down when applying it to the
4:40bottom
4:41look up or straight that way your body's natural reflex doesn't freak out when it
4:45sees this stick poking near your eye
4:48moving on to the brows using the taupe eyebrow pencil create feathery strokes
4:53to imitate little brow hairs using an angled eyeliner brush add fullness to
4:59the browse by flipping them out when your boo is complaining that you're
5:03taking way too long to do your makeup
5:05tell him next time browse over those when both eyes have the perfect lines
5:11use the wings as a guide to add more dimension to your crease with a small
5:15eyeshadow brush and using the same cream eyeliner intensify the depth of your
5:19eyes
5:20ok let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the cheeks find a dark brown
5:27hair that's three to four shades darker than your skin color to carve out your
5:31cheekbones with a fluffy angled brush to keep your contour as natural looking as
5:35possible use a light hand and try not to get too close to your mouth
5:40add bronzer along your temples to accentuate your face
5:43all right back to the eyes find a glittery eyeshadow in with your pinky
5:49because it's super tiny pop this shimmery eyeshadow along the inner third
5:53of your eyelid blending with your ring finger
5:56this will help bring more magic to your eyes
6:02by now my lips are nice and soft
6:05thanks to the coconut bomb and it's ready to be painted black
6:09before I apply any color make sure there's not a product left on the lips
6:13you want to remove any lingering concealer or foundation with a wipe
6:17giving yourself a clean canvas to work with ok now the moment of truth
6:23break out the darkest lip color you have start with the biggest areas on your
6:27lips around the center of the bottom and top lip
6:30it's kind of like painting within the lines so start with the largest areas
6:33first from there
6:35carefully apply the lipstick to the outline of your lips and it's totally
6:39fine if it's not perfect because we're going to clean it up later if you want
6:45more precision use a smaller brush to adjust the lines for a cleaner shape
6:52very nice
6:56all right moving on to hear if you're not using argan oil in your hair
7:00you're missing out all the nutrients lost during coloring treatments and heat
7:05styling can be restored if you use oils like argan oil the Royal Egyptians were
7:10young to have beautiful silky hair
7:12thanks to oil what you want to do is warm up the oil between your hands and
7:16finger comb through your hair for that silky finish
7:20and now it's time to transform into my alter ego
7:25there's a lot of beautiful temporary tattoos that you can find online or on
7:29etsy find your favorite design that speaks to you if you don't know exactly
7:34where an important part of the design is going to be placed
7:37what I like to do is cut a notch in the paper before I apply here I cut out a
7:43little notch in the middle of the neck application so I know exactly where to
7:47Center it and once you have it on and it's nice and centered had lightly with
7:51a water-soaked paper towel or sponge try to make sure that it thoroughly wet
7:56if you want to check to see if it transferred peel back one side slightly
8:00and if the tattoo is revealed
8:02you can safely peel the whole thing off from here
8:06just add more tattoos where you see fit
8:10tell your own story through these tattoos
8:14the art and design should inspire you don't worry they're only temporary
8:19so you can experiment as many times as you want with zero commitment
8:24now my alter ego look is complete if you're going to recreate your alter ego
8:28look
8:29make sure to tag me in all your pictures so that I can see now and like them
8:33mmm i love you dreamers good luck
8:40yeah
8:54yeah
8:59yeah
0:00yeah
0:00so i'm really loving taylor swift's me look and in this video i'm gonna show
0:05you how to recreate it
0:06majority of the products that i'm using in this video are from december's ipsy
0:10glam bag but if you don't have one no worries because i'm going to describe
0:14the colors as best as i can and you guys can use any products that you have that
0:17are similar at your disposal
0:19first thing first primary eyes primer is not only great to help saturate color
0:23but it also helps prevent smudging
0:26all right let's recreate Taylor's famous eyeliner look using Urban Decay's 24-7
0:31black liner
0:32I'm going to load it on my brush first the reason why I'm using a flat edge
0:36eyeliner brush is because sometimes the tip of the eyeliner pencil can be a
0:41little too blunt
0:42so what i'm doing here is i'm just flicking the brush ever so slightly to
0:46create an illusion of twinkling looking eyes like Taylor's notice how the cotton
0:51swab has a point your end
0:53cosmetic grey cotton swabs are seriously a must have for all you make up levers
0:58ok so finish line in your eyes and let's move on to making your eyes sparkle try
1:04and find a champagne loose eyeshadow color of your trace the 1 i'm using here
1:08is mixed ultra pearl mania eyeshadow pigments tend to have a stronger payout
1:13than regular eye shadows because the intensity is stronger uses as
1:18highlighter for your eyes to help brighten them up
1:20ok so depending on how much I laid space you have
1:24I prefer calling it eyelid real estate what i'm doing here is bringing my
1:28eyeliner up a few millimeters below my crease line
1:32so here's the thing this smaller and thinner your eyeliner is the bigger your
1:36eyes will look because you're showing your lips space
1:39be careful not to make your eyeliner shape too big or else you can look like
1:43an anime character
1:48now it's time to curl your lashes to get them nice and perky
1:55what you're going to do is apply mascara on your upper and lower lash line
2:02we move the eyes are done moving on to foundation before you do anything prime
2:08your face
2:08i'm using the same Mirabella one that I used on my eyes
2:13yeah
2:17take your foundation and if you want to match Taylor skin color
2:21she has a very fair complexion so I'm just going to go a few shades lighter
2:24than my own skin color blend away
2:30with a cosmetic sponge dipped in white cream add this to your cheeks nose
2:35bridge and chin to highlight this area
2:41and it's time to bleach my hair so i can turn it blonde
2:44this is honestly the worst week I've ever use
2:47sadly i ordered it online and I didn't try it out before the tutorials so i had
2:52to make do because all the workshops were closed as long as you guys get the
2:55picture
2:56a fake lashes for that extra glam
3:01and if your eyes are blue like Taylor's use blue contacts to match your icon
3:06time to contour your nose and cheekbones
3:08i'm using a matte taupe color you want to make sure that it's matt and don't
3:13use any shimmery bronzer or won't look as natural time to highlight the face
3:21i'm using my Couture is highlighting the sheets I'm just gonna tear one sheet out
3:25and highlight my cheekbones to recreate Taylor's glowing skin and of course you
3:30have to finish off with her signature red lip color I'm going to line my lips
3:36like so and sculpt them in to match her lip shape you want to use concealer
3:46around the lips to create a very precise lip shape
3:52time for the last step just finish off with the red lip gloss of your trace the
3:55red lip gloss that i'm using here is by be a bombshell
3:58it is impossible to go around with red during this holiday season
4:03actually you really don't have to look like taylor to rock this classic look
4:08finished
4:10I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
4:22good luck everyone and don't forget to check out XKCD com the beauty community
4:27i created for you guys
4:28happy holidays
0:00summer is finally here
0:10my favorite part about summer is hanging out with my friends and finding ways to
0:14capture more memories which means i gotta make sure your look at gunpoint
0:20so i'm going to show you how to achieve that glow doing skin that will last
0:24sweats & Son start off with the cleansing wipe and clear off every trace
0:30of leftover makeup dirt and oil
0:33prep the skin with a cooling cucumber facial mask the cucumber works to combat
0:39readiness by soothing this area
0:41just wait 10 minutes and then clean up your face
0:45so i've been using here this nifty new skincare product from Korea
0:49it's called a cool poor stick that provides a thin layer of moisture that
0:53combats dry spots and the best part
0:55it doesn't leave behind a sticky texture now that your skin is prepped
0:59you're ready to move on to make up begin with an oil-free primer and apply this
1:03along any area of the face that tends to get shiny
1:06if you have large pores or fine lines this will soften and reduce the
1:10appearance
1:11i love using a brush whenever i'm applying primer because it really gets
1:15into all the nooks and crannies
1:17moving on to foundation I like to cocktail a few products so I'm mixing in
1:21a dewy formula with my favorite long-wear BB cream that has a built-in
1:26sunscreen
1:27this gives me buildable coverage with a subtle globe
1:30i'm all about that glow
1:31for your under-eye gently . a light concealer and softly to fuse with your
1:41ring finger
1:42now that you've perfected your skin beat your face with a soft translucent powder
1:47to keep everything in place
1:52next add some dimension to your face while warming up your skin with a matte
1:56bronzer bronzer outline of her face like around the temples cheekbones and under
2:01the jaw line
2:02try and keep your application light and let your radiant skin shine through you
2:07should look sunkissed not Burt
2:09cool so moving on to rise prep your lids with a flesh tone base because the skin
2:14around the eye area is so thin blood vessels might show through but a flesh
2:19tone base or concealer will help reduce the appearance and now that your eyes
2:23are primed get a neutral palette that you're crushing on this one's pretty
2:27legit
2:28all right go in with a tan colored shadow and use this as a wash on your
2:33lids to warm up your eyes
2:36yeah
2:38next color up should be am at smoky color add this deep shade all along your
2:43upper and lower lash line and blend it out
2:46we want a nice hazy smoldering look to make sure to blend blend blend it should
2:51be a subtle gradient
2:53here's a fun tip try and use another clean fluffy brush to haze out the color
2:57to maintain dimensionalize take a light nude eyeshadow and pop this color under
3:03your brows along the brow bone and continue blending
3:11time for some shimmer and sparkles find a sparkling peach tone color and paint
3:16this along the inner corner of your eyes to highlight this area using a metallic
3:21copper color add this along the top of your eyelids and softly blend out
3:26highlighting key areas on the eyes will help make them stand out more
3:30if your brows are sparse like mine here find a tough shadow for your brows and
3:34color them in with a brush for a more natural look
3:38I like to top it off with a brow pencil by feathering in the illusion of brow
3:44hairs so try and find a double-ended brow pencil that has both the pencil and
3:49the spoolie I know once my browser set
3:52I feel so much more confident in my face feels complete
3:56oh my dear brow pencil you complete me why use a black eyeliner when there are
4:01so many colors to choose from
4:03summertime should inspire you to try a new eyeliner color just be bold
4:07try a deep teal eye liner and line your eyes as close to the lash line as
4:13possible and pops them along the waterline to intensify the eyes
4:17you don't have to draw a perfect line in one take especially if you have shaky
4:21hands instead you can actually build up the line until you have a flawless shape
4:26i know i said to experiment with more color for your eyeliner but if you
4:31prefer to stick with your trusty old black liner try a gel baseliner instead
4:37this works better during the summertime because one its water resistant into
4:41it's easier to apply try to experiment with different eyeliner brushes until
4:46you find the right one
4:47you feel confident with all you have to do now is curl the lashes as used and
4:52apply several coats of mascara and through your lashes feel fat and juicy
4:57yeah bring in the light with a highlighter makes your highlighter with
5:01a bit of bronzer for that summer glow and touch this across your cheek bones
5:05use a warm highlighter and with a smaller brush dab the highlighter along
5:09the high points on your face for that dewy finish if you want a more natural
5:13look
5:14use the fan brush and sweep the highlighter across your cheeks for
5:18subtle highlight if you happen to be taking photos with flash the light is
5:22going to reflect off the highlighter
5:24so your cheekbones look . for lips there are so many fun colors to choose from a
5:29red a blood orange coral pink or you can try out the new metallic lip trend
5:36yep it's all about the late nineties and early two thousands
5:40you're going to be seeing a lot of metallic textures on the phase fashion
5:44and everywhere
5:45once you're done applying your lip color if you want a full lip allusion to have
5:49a bit of highlighter along your Cupid's bow
5:52I used to color my hair every six months and it became so dry and brittle that
5:57I'm actually taking a break from harsh coloring and instead I'm nourishing the
6:02ends of my hair with hair oil find one that's infused with vitamin E

0:00hey gorgeous i'm going to show you how to recreate this spring beauty look
0:04using some of my favorite cruelty products and also i'm going to show you
0:11how to recreate this cute DIY succulent as always start with a clean face d puff
0:17and awaken your eyes using under eye patches or chamomile tea bags
0:21leave them on for a few minutes and remove say bye to your puffiness your
0:25skin is going to feel super refreshed time to prep your makeup so just stipple
0:29on a primer to help smooth out your skin
0:31try to focus around the t-zone area because this is where you're going to
0:35see a lot of shine
0:36keep puffing in whatever is left on the brush and let's move on to brightening
0:39up that I area using a small brush apply concealer gently around your eye area
0:45try to be gentle around this area because the skin around the eyes is very
0:48delicate use any excess product even out dark spots in any blemishes on the skin
0:54I tend to have a lot of redness around my nose engine area so I like to pack on
0:58a little more concealer around here majority of your skin problem is not
1:02what you put on your skin
1:04but what you put in your body and how stressed out you are so try your best
1:08eat healthy and relax the more you're stressed out
1:11the more your skin will show it try using blotting papers to control oil
1:15this is by far my favorite blotting paper brand apparently it's from japan
1:18in geishas use this to touch up your makeup
1:21press them on anywhere to minimize shine and lightly go over them with powder to
1:25enhance the effect
1:26doing this helps keep your powder from looking too cakey also if your boyfriend
1:30is not into makeup
1:32what you want to tone down that shyness and pictures try using this instead of
1:35powder
1:36trust me on this one depending on your skin type if you have oily skin use a
1:40powder highlighter
1:41if you have dry skin use a liquid or cream highlighter highlight your cheeks
1:47and take whatever is left on the brush down your neck and across your shoulders
1:52this will give you that beautiful shimmery glow keep your brows natural by
1:56lightly filling them in and defining their shape with a pencil eyebrows are
2:00very personal and will change as you grow so keep experimenting
2:04once you have a shape you like run the spoolie over your brows to blend the
2:07pencil out this will give it a more natural finish
2:10just keep the hairs in place by sweeping them up and out for the eyes
2:14we're giving them a sweet pastel pop of color take a nude pink and Pat this all
2:18over your lower lash line and lid
2:20this will bring a more romantic mood to your eyes now you can take a pastel blue
2:25color and pass this along your upper lash line bringing the color out blend
2:29out the eye area with a fluffy brush to give your eyes a subtle wash of color
2:34try and keep it light for the liner take an icy blue pencil and place it around
2:39the inner corners to open up your eyes keep lining up words along the inner
2:43half of your lid and into the crease like this to touch right under your brow
2:47bone and blend out to highlight this area and to finish off just set the
2:51cream pencil with an iridescent white eyeshadow
2:56now if you want to make your eyes stand out even more
3:00take a dark eyeliner pencil and tight line your upper and lower waterline
3:04everyone has their favorite way to line their eyes I prefer doing it with a
3:08brush
3:09so with an angled liner brush when it over the pencil and then stay as close
3:13to the lash line as possible
3:15sweep the brush out to create a double wing and don't forget to line along your
3:19lower lash line as well to help balance out your eyes from here just curl your
3:23lashes and apply a few coats of volumizing mascara for that finishing
3:27touch with neutral tone contrast stick to find the shape of your nose
3:34blending as you go with a small fluffy brush this will give you that cute
3:37button nose effect
3:38add dimension to your face by applying some bronzer to scope out your face and
3:44apply blush to add color to your cheeks or lips
3:47line them the nude pink color and fill them in taking a baby pink matte lip
3:53cream place it in the center of your lips and blend it out with a fluffy
3:57eyeshadow brush to keep the color from bleeding
4:00as you can see you have baby dollops clean up the edges of your lips with a
4:03little bit of concealer on a flat synthetic brush
4:06perfect ok so moving on to hear i'm using this rainbow barrel curling iron
4:11to create loose tousled waves
4:13seriously this is the prettiest curling are never right you want them to look
4:16natural and undone so wrap the hair around the barrel
4:20wait a few seconds and release
4:23ok
4:26for nails find a bright vibrant pink or baby blue nail polish to match the
4:33spring colors finish off with perfume that smells like a fresh spring day
4:38personally I love using rollerball perfume because they're super easy to
4:42travel with and you just need to have a little along the wrist like this and
4:46gently press your wrists together for that incident sent add a touch along
4:50your neck line as well

5:10d pot the plants one by one into the jar and carefully fill in the extra space
5:15with some dirt

5:20little bit of water to keep them happy and hydrated

0:07and every one of us has energy pulsing through our bodies and using
0:11state-of-the-art technology we can actually see the electromagnetic waves
0:15we radiate from within these waves are translated into colors so I invited a
0:21team of experienced or photographers to come into the studio for a reading this
0:25machine was able to capture my inner light
0:28each color corresponds with the mood in treat how you feel on the inside
0:32reflects on the outside you might not be able to see the light
0:36but those who are sensitive can sense it I guess you can say this is kind of like
0:40an inner selfie
0:41after seeing my own aura I was inspired to create this dreamy look that will
0:46make it look as if you're glowing from within
0:48all right let your inner beauty shine through by starting with a clean face
0:53i'm using here this soy milk cleanser to keep my skin supple and smooth
0:57put some on your hands and spread it all over your face massage your face as you
1:01go and rinse optically alright so moving on to a mat poor reducing primer evenly
1:07apply this product using a stippling brush
1:10onto the lips you can add a touch of a moisturizing lipstick with a hint of
1:16tint
1:16this will enhance your natural lip color giving your lips and nice flushed
1:21look there is definitely beauty in simplicity time for foundation take a
1:26few pumps on the back of her hand and load some onto your stippling brush
1:30the goal is to avoid covering your entire face
1:33you just want to even out your skin's natural texture and color focus on the
1:38areas around your nose lips and eyes for a bit of coverage around your eyes use a
1:44creamy concealer to conceal your dark circles
1:46try finding a hydrating concealer because you're under eyes tend to be a
1:50little bit more dry than the rest of your face
1:54take a little extra and tap it on as eyeshadow base
1:58remember to be gentle with the delicate skin around your eyes
2:01don't ugh it's totally normal if your lip shape is not even if you want to
2:05reshape them take a little more concealer on a small synthetic brush and
2:10line your lips to even out the shape
2:12afterwards just be sure to blend out with a sponge whatever you have left
2:16over
2:16just even out your eyes and blend that out as well
2:20ok now you can take a nude highlighter and accentuate areas of your face
2:25wherever the light naturally hits your face accentuate that area you can apply
2:30along your brow bones inner corners of your eyes a little on your nose cheeks
2:36and keep its bow
2:38here's a fun tip drawing small crosses on your cheeks will help highlight
2:42without looking too harsh and with a brush slightly blend out the highlighter
2:46light will reflect wherever you apply this highlighter
2:51this will give you that in chanting glow as for your eyes take a sheer creamy eye
2:55shadow and Pat it all over your lids for a wash of color
2:59try finding a beautiful lie light color and if you want to go for a more air
3:04deficit look on your eyes as if light is coming from within
3:08take a frosty white shadow to brighten your inner corners and bring this glow
3:12all the way up to your crease framing the inner half of your eye place any
3:16leftover product on your brow bone and tap it along the lower lash line
3:20this will give your eyes a halo effect on to eyeliner
3:24we don't want this look to appear too harsh so just tight line your eyes by
3:28lifting up your lashes quickly and gently gliding the pencil along the
3:32upper waterline
3:33if your eyes get watery it's totally normal once you tightly under eyes
3:37add some of this pencil eyeliner on an angled brush and wing it along the upper
3:41lashes
3:42let's give some love to your lashes find a mascara with a tiny one this one is
3:46perfect for getting extra close to the roots of your lashes
3:50creating a tight lining effect so come thru your favorite mascara that has a
3:55natural finish you want to make sure to keep your brows looking natural for this
3:58look so use a pencil or powder to fill them in enhance the shape but don't
4:03overdo it
4:04brush the hairs into place and blend out the color if your browser appear drawn
4:08on
4:08try using feathery strokes this will give them a more natural finish
4:12all right take your favorite highlighting powder and we're basically
4:15going to cheat that glow from within
4:17use a tapered brush highlight on the areas on your cheats where light is
4:20naturally hitting it and whatever is left over on your brush
4:24just tap a little on your forehead unless you already have a nice curved
4:28forehead
4:29I'd skip this step continue building up your highlights until you've reached the
4:33glow you're satisfied with using your index or ring finger . some product
4:37under your eyes to punctuate the halo effect and if you want you can even
4:41highlight your collar bones so that the light can reflect off of them and if
4:45you're looking to give your lips that aura like low use a lip liner that
4:49slightly deeper than your natural lip color line your lips and blend it out
4:53just keep repeating until you're happy with the shade and shape of your lips to
4:58soften the look of your lips take a soft pastel lipstick that compliments your
5:02skin tone and place it all over
5:05now with a frosty shadow from before Pat it on the center of your lips
5:10finish it off by adding a nice tinted oil that will add extra moisture and
5:14shine
5:15don't look like the hair it needs to be shiny - I'm a huge believer in using
5:20hair oil take a dime sized amount of argan oil in the palm of her hands and
5:24rub them together to warm up the product and from there just run your fingers
5:28through your hair
5:29focusing on your ends keep finger coming until your hair feel soft and you see
5:33that shine
5:34all right and now you can style your hair I'm going to keep it simple and use
5:38my trusty old hair clip that super 90 is looking
5:42click the sides of your hair back and take a few front pieces to frame your
5:46face and now my dear you're done go out there and let your beautiful or shine

0:00hi beautiful a lot of you have been asking me to create more hair fashion
0:04nail and makeup tutorials so an idea popped in my head
0:07inspired by sailing captain planet these gorgeous ladies here including myself
0:11are combining our forces to create this multifaceted tutorial cosmic candy
0:18ok let's start with Jesse if you're getting bored of your plain black
0:22t-shirt or short
0:23look no further than the stars for inspiration you'll need a few sponges
0:27brushes glitter spray pastel fabric paints and a spray bottle filled with
0:32water
0:33what your sponge and loaded up with the lavender shade start tapping the paint
0:37onto the shorts when you're painting anything Galaxy inspired
0:41it's all about creating depth with these colors make sure to blend out any harsh
0:45edges
0:48now that you have the base done it's time to layer more colors to give your
0:52shorts more dimension take a light neutral shade like a white or silver and
0:56use this as a highlighter wherever it feels two dimensional highlight continue
1:01adding depth using mid tone colors like magenta and teal and you can add that
1:05cosmic touch
1:06I carefully flicking white paint from a small brush
1:09look you just created stars pretty be one with the galaxy shorts blend out the
1:15edges as needed and repeat these steps to continue layering for your desired
1:19look
1:20and if you feel like you're at a good place use your small brush again for the
1:23finishing touches
1:24it's all about the details here you can create starburst planets
1:28whatever for that extra effect spray a little bit of that silver or white color
1:34thus creating a sprinkle of star clusters
1:39yeah
1:41yeah
1:42moving onto Kristin if you want to recreate her out of this world now look
1:46you need to make up brushes
1:48these are denser than regular arts punches and will ensure even application
1:52to start take a protective base coat and layer this on your nails
2:01now you can coat and iridescent white polish on top of the base coat
2:06depending on your polish formula you only need one to two coats
2:12now just top it off with a light pastel pink color because you have several
2:17layers of paint on your nails
2:19you're in this awkward stage where you can't really do anything that requires
2:23serious hand movements so i can watch your favorite show
2:27read a book or go online basically kill time at least 10 minutes for your nails
2:31to dry completely
2:33no one is perfect that's why nail polish remover was invented
2:36so load up an old eyeliner brush with nail polish remover and clean up any
2:41smudges perfect colors you will need are a magenta purple shade a vibrant pink
2:47and a powder blue and if you want a more subtle look focus on creating a
2:51statement nail instead of painting all of them
2:54you can paint directly on the sponge combining all the colors and press this
2:57onto your nail you want to use this time to experiment so
3:01unleash your inner Monet using the pointed edge of a cuticle stick a
3:05toothpick paper clip
3:07basically anything pointing make little crosses and dots to recreate the stars
3:11all right from here just top off your nails with glitter
3:16now it's time to dry that means time to veg out and be a princess because you
3:21can't do anything with wet nails
3:23once you're in the clear add a clear glossy top coat and you're done
3:28so pretty sailor moon would dig this krispies hair color will change
3:32depending on the mood now she's going to show you how to give your hair that
3:36galactic edge using hair chalk
3:39first thing first make sure you're wearing a shirt that you're not going to
3:42miss because talking is messy
3:44the night before prep your hair with a leave-in conditioner because chalk is
3:48drying to begin
3:50take a small section of hair focusing on the ends
3:53place it between the makeup sponge and blue hair truck press lightly and pull
3:57through to get the best color payoff
3:59repeat this step using a green color applying it above the blue for a
4:03gradient effect and after you've done a third of your hair spray it with
4:07hairspray to set it before the color can transfer or shake off
4:11repeat these steps until all your ends have been chopped and set
4:15once you're done show and tell take a selfie aunt Agatha's moving on to Katie

7:17yeah
0:00Union koala hi gorgeous I have here a beautiful look for you to try out to
0:05ring in the lunar new year
0:07it's the year of the goat or sheep a year of promise and prosperity
0:11before we begin we need to have a fresh clean face
0:15so take a cleansing wipe and gently prep the delicate area under your eyes making
0:20sure that your face is completely clean
0:23we need our skin to be free of any oil and dirt and if my under eyes are
0:27feeling puffy
0:28I'll use the treatment like this to help perk them up it's kind of like a cup of
0:31coffee for the eyes
0:33yep thank the internet for my late nights
0:37let it sit for a few minutes and then just wipe it off with a white clean
0:43tissue
0:45ok now that my eyes are awake one last step before moving on to makeup is
0:50priming the skin find one with a built-in moisturizer a primer helps
0:55create a smoother skin surface minimizing pores and fine lines
1:00however if you're a teenager you can skip primer you don't need this stuff
1:04so to supply this baby all over your face or just spot treat on any problem
1:09areas like an oily t-zone
1:12now you can take a nap of concealer and gently apply under your eyes
1:16you want to be extra gentle because this area is very delicate
1:20all right if you're looking more alive than you are good
1:24so we can now move on to our favorite foundation or BB cream for a while I've
1:29been substituting my foundation with a cushion compact like this one
1:33this was a gift from korea from something that instead of using your
1:37hands or brush cushion compact has a very specific application with the
1:42cushion sponge provided dab it on the sponge soaked in BB or CC cream and very
1:48lightly dab on your face like foundation BB or CC cream from Korea is very
1:54different than BB and CC cream from the West
1:57the coverage is light to medium in the finish is Dewey so i recommend trying
2:01different formulations before settling with your Holy Grail
2:05so continue dabbing the cushion sponge all over your face until you even out
2:09your complexion
2:10when I know how to cheat a flawless complexion use a lightweight highlighter
2:14there are two parts to healthy looking skin complexion and luminosity a
2:19highlighter can help punctuated this by giving you that boost the key
2:23less is more you need just a little small dabs here and there on the high
2:27points of your cheeks and forehead and tip of the nose and Cupid's bow ready to
2:32blush with a shimmering peach blush
2:35loaded up with your brush and locating your cheekbones lightly dust the brush
2:40all over this area
2:41building up the color for this look you don't want to look as if you're wearing
2:46blush it should look as if you're really blushing
2:49all right it's time to move on to the eyebrows if you have sparse brows like
2:53myself here
2:54use a matte powder that's a few shades darker than your own hair color and
2:58lightly fill in your brows
3:02if you need more definition use a brow pencil and sketch little hair marks with
3:08your spoolie brush blend and soften any harsh marks
3:14on to the eyes take a matte taupe eyeshadow color and contour your lids
3:21sweeping the brush back and forth
3:23make sure it's blended we're going for a soft look
3:27yeah
3:30now take a deeper terracotta color and deep in the outer corner blending and
3:35diffusing the color into the creases with a fluffy shadow brush with a
3:43smaller brush use a shimmering sunset peach and build the color up starting
3:49around the inner corner of your eyes and blend out this is going to help warm up
3:53your eyes
3:54tap a small brush into a vanilla highlighter and very carefully blend
3:59into the inner corner of your eyes and along the lower lash line
4:03this will help bring more light to your eyes and dab whatever is left along your
4:07brow bone for extra definition going back with the fluffy brush soften and
4:12blend the colors together using an eyeliner in a plum color carefully
4:17line your upper lashes making sure to stay as close to the lash line as
4:22possible
4:22mmm everyone looks good with the winged eyeliner so go ahead and sketch that
4:27line out make sure it tapers up because this will help lift up your eyes and if
4:33you want a fuller lash line tight line your upper waterline
4:37this might feel uncomfortable at first but believe me it will look good
4:42no pain no game if you want to brighten your eyes take a white eyeliner and
4:47gently line along their lower waterline
4:50and add a touch along the inner corners of your eyes and if you want a more
4:54subtle option
4:55try a peach a rose gold eyeliner you know what time it is time to perk them
5:00lashes
5:01hold your lash curler for a few seconds on each I veteran as so if you're
5:06lacking in the lash Department like myself here
5:09use a lash primer to give your lashes that boost
5:13it's like stilettos for your lashes coat your lashes from root to tip making sure
5:18to flick the wand out at the ends now you can take your favorite jet black
5:23mascara and place it over your lash primer to complete the lashes apply
5:27generous coats
5:30just give the lower lashes and instead mixer taupe and terracotta colors
5:34together and staying as close to the lash line as possible
5:39shadow in this area now it's time for some glam
5:42yes honey but real talk here at the start of the new year fireworks
5:48banging pots and pans basically making real loud noises right after midnight
5:52was said to help ward off any evil spirit and bad luck
5:56instead of fireworks and banging pots and pans i'm going to use this glitter
5:59liner as a symbolic gesture
6:02just place a little around your inner corners to add a fun accent lighting up
6:07your eyes now for those lips in Chinese culture
6:10red is a symbol of happiness and good fortune
6:14so for this look I'm gonna rock a matte red lip
6:17ok so this lip liner has an ankle tip actually pretty useful because I can
6:22create any shape and line with ease
6:25if you want a bold look over draw a little over your Cupid's bow and make
6:29the lines tangled very carefully fill your lips in focusing around the edges
6:36and now it's time to top it off with a red matte lipstick so filling your lips
6:42and get it if you have a dark plum lipstick or eyeshadow softly built
6:51around the corners of your mouth
6:53notice how this creates depth giving it a darker touch
7:00yeah
7:02blend the color with a brush and then reapply the dark plum if you want to
7:06increase the intensity and once you are happy with the depth reapply the red lip
7:16color to top off the look for extra credit
7:20use a flesh tone pencil and sharpen the edges for a flawless look we're not done
7:27yet
7:28you want to smell as good as you look so damn a bit of your favorite fragrance or
7:33essential oil on your wrist and gently press them together for a lasting effect
7:38when I know a trick that will drive that someone special crazy
7:42apply a little behind your ears and along the sides of her neck mmm for your
7:48hair
7:48try a volumizing oil sprain working towards the end and just finger comb
7:53through your hair to distribute the product evenly finished yay
7:57the year of the goat or sheep is all about being thankful for the things in
8:01your life and staying positive about where you go in the future

1:00finals work for the holidays
1:03first take a deep breath huh because we all have concealer here to the rescue
1:09if you have any blemishes or even like myself an awesome mustache shadow

1:16mmm gotta have them eyebrows on fleek you want to find a color that's two to
1:20three shades darker than your natural hair color or two to three shades
1:24lighter if you want a softer look I'm going to keep my brow shape straighter
1:28than normal for a sophisticated look with a taupe or neutral color loaded up
1:33and dab along the outer corner of your eyes to contour your lids
1:37from there and just bring this color down towards the lower lash line to help
1:41balance out the look and blend with the fluffy end for soft finish next step
1:47eyeliner i'm using one here by hikari and it has a metallic finish for an
1:52added dimensional look

2:58lashes by Fanning up and out for that ethereal finish
3:04I'm going to recreate a frosted lip all you have to do is reapply your lip
3:09butter and add a touch of the rose gold pigment on your lips focusing on the
3:14center of your lips and Cupid's bow and if you want to glam it up add a touch of
3:18gloss on your lips
3:20Yas honey this is a personal last step because I'm obsessed with highlighters

5:09because people
5:26yeah
5:28yeah
0:00hey guys so this look right here i'm going to show you how to get it
0:04all right let's bring back the nineties with this crunch BTW look
0:10you want to start off with a naked face by wiping it clean with a cotton pad
0:16you should look as if you're not wearing any foundation so try using a BB or CC
0:21cream
0:22that's going to help give you that no makeup look
0:25apply a thin layer on your face and Pat to blend find a concealer that can cover
0:31and lasts a few swipes under your panda eyes is all you really need
0:36and with your ring fingers Pat gently to blend and whatever is left over
0:40just use it around the nose and on your eyelids to reduce redness know you can
0:45use a powder that you're loving and dusted under the eyes
0:48Pat's him on the lids and oily areas on the face to reduce showing if you prefer
0:53having glowing skin just use blotting papers instead of powder
0:56peace out Greece and if you're lacking in the brow department
1:01no worries just use a grayish brown powder to fill in your mouse
1:05this will create the illusion of fuller looking brows use a pencil to draw and
1:11redefine the brow shape sketch little dashes to mimic brow hairs and
1:15use the spoolie brush to soften the marks so that they don't look so drawn
1:19on let's break out your eyeshadows find am a camel color in with your brush all
1:25you really need is an applicator and blender and use this color along the
1:30outer third of your eyes to create the illusion of depth and shadow load a
1:36little bit of the camel color on your blender brush and buff the color along
1:40the outer third again to create a hazy look
1:44follow the natural contours on your eyes you'll notice right away how big they're
1:48gonna look find a mas color with a pearl finish and add this color along the
1:53outer lash line
1:55this is going to help wide in the shape of your eyes giving them a sexy look
2:03and just top off your eye makeup with a metallic gray denim color and you can
2:07use your clean ring finger for this part
2:09just Pat it on the center of the lids and use your brush to feather it out for
2:13smoldering finish if you have a dark brown eyeliner colored use this under
2:18the lower lash line and outer upper lash line
2:21this will help accentuate the shape of your beautiful eyes
2:25if you already have curly lashes just skip this step but if you don't use a
2:31lash curler to perk up the lashes
2:33this opens up the eyes right away find a mascara that can give you sky-high
2:38lashes sweep generous codes through the lashes and watch them grow and just keep
2:44applying generous coats until you've reached the length you're happy with
2:47because we're going to use a lip liner prep your lips first with a lip balm and
2:52i'm just going to use a very light layer of my pillow plush and berries for the
2:56cheeks you can either contour for that supermodel circulated cheekbones or use
3:02a multi blush for a light touch of color on the cheeks trying to avoid pink and
3:07peach
3:07it's not going to work with this color palette add this on the cheekbones and
3:11blend with your fingers
3:13another way to apply is too low the color directly on your fingers first
3:17quickly padding the cheek area for that blushing finish with the dark red or
3:22plan what color outline your lips first
3:25this will prevent your lip color from feather and then just fill in your lips
3:29to help boost the longevity of your lip color
3:33very nice onto the lip color find a dark plum or oxblood lip color and paint this
3:42rich color on the lips
3:44try and use a brush especially when you're working with a dark color so that
3:48you can have an even application
4:01and for my nails I decided to wear a dark red wine color
4:06who would have guessed they now make hair CC cream crazy
4:10so use your favorite styling cream and warm it up between your fingers breasts
4:14before running them through the hair for that texture bedhead finish
4:24looking good and if you want that finishing touch
4:28just enhance your scent with a light fragrance and this is why i love
4:32rollerball fragrances because a light touch on my wrist is all I really need
4:37and if you want to grab that special someone's attention just add a little
4:41bit behind your ears
4:42normal soon you should smell as good as you look
4:46all right beautiful just share your brunch beauty look to me by hashtagging
4:50mish look and if you happen to get lipstick on your teeth
4:57just use the thumb sucking technique and you'll be good to go
5:01all right everyone i hope you had fun with this tutorial and good luck
5:18yeah
0:00yeah
0:02yeah
0:04hey gorges I have an enchanting beauty look for you to try out
0:09it's perfect for a music festival or any summer parties start with a cc or BB
0:16cream and lightly Pat this over your entire face with your clean hands
0:25the stream you can also use a foundation or stippling brush or sponge
0:33concealer should be used sparingly remember a little goes a long way
0:38all you really need is one swipe under the eyes down the bridge of your nose
0:42for highlighter around the sides of the nose and mouth to cover up any redness
0:46and all blemishes
0:47try using your fingers to apply this warms up the product and makes the
0:52application smoother and easier blend away for a flawless finish
0:57as of lately I've been using to brow pencils to fill in my brows
1:03if you ever look closely at your brows you might notice that towards the inner
1:06corners they're more sparse and towards the end there more full your brows don't
1:11have to match your hair color
1:13you should either be darker or lighter depending on the look you're going for
1:20on the ice start with a matte cream base to even out the color of your lids
1:29next apply a shimmering lavender color along the crease of your eye and blend
1:34away
1:35this will give your eyes a tin chanting mood through the canyon
1:42the next step take a light pink eyeshadow and apply this all over the
1:47lids and blend up into the crease you wanted to look as light and airy as
1:51possible
1:53add more dimension to your eyes with highlighter lift up the eyes with a hint
1:58of shimmer along the inner corner of your eyes and brow bone
2:08to open up your eyes for that summary look use a sunshine yellow eyeliner on
2:13the bottom waterline
2:16notice how much brighter the eyes look your eyes will definitely stand out in
2:20pictures to really give this look a bowl pop use a vibrant blue or teal color to
2:26line the top and bottom lash line
2:28i'm going to start with the lower lash line first keeping the line thin now
2:33just lie in the upper lashline staying as close to the lash line as possible to
2:37intensify the eye makeup
2:43and extend out to form a cat eye
2:50gently soften the edges with a clean brush
2:53this will give your eye makeup that theory look and if you're looking for a
2:58more subtle look just switch out the blue liner for something more delicate
3:01and natural like a navy or dark brown almost done with the eye makeup
3:06we just need a few swipes of your trusty little mascara for perky lashes finish
3:10off your summer look with a beautiful baby pink lipstick
3:13keep your lip color natural because this look is all about your eyes as much
3:19there's no ax to bold or too simple that's not worth your self expression i
3:24challenge you to explore and test your boundaries play with color patterns and
3:28styles and looks

3:55the I should be in the ears should line up to the eyes the nose will sit around

0:21ok
0:25before applying makeup
0:29make sure your face is polished and moisturised i recommend exfoliating your
0:33skin twice a week
0:34if you have normal to dry skin three times a week if you have oily skin and
0:40if exfoliating is too harsh on your sensitive skin
0:43try using a gentle makeup cleanser instead try and avoid any products with
0:48harsh chemicals so that it doesn't irritate your skin find one that has
0:52natural ingredients and once you're all skincare it up and you want to boost
0:56your makeups longevity use a mattifying face primer apply this product on any
1:01oily spots on your face like your nose and forehead
1:04really work the product onto your skin because you're creating a barrier
1:08between your skincare and makeup and once you're all primed up
1:11let's get started with face makeup using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream
1:16and with your clean fingers brush or my current fav Christian cream sponge apply
1:21your product evenly on your face and back to blend out to create a smooth
1:25even finish
1:29perhaps in the future dark circles will be a thing in the past but for now
1:34concealer will do the trick find a neutralizing concealer that can cover up
1:38those dark circles
1:39especially for any of you who aren't getting enough sleep you want to find a
1:42product that will offer high coverage you'll find that you're going to use
1:46less product and it will look much more natural and less Kiki
1:50ok so powder way to steal your face makeup in
1:58undo the browse some people don't need to touch them but for the rest of us
2:03filling and reshaping them can make a world of a difference
2:07don't believe me watch a little flake here and there and watch your brows come
2:11to life with the black trim the eyeliner take the time to run the pencil along
2:22your lash line and feather it out and if you're going for a nonchalant look stop
2:30here
2:30but if you want to clean it up and give your line and nice edge use an angled
2:34liner brush and start smudging a line to sculpt your perfect liner shape
2:39try and find a creamy eye liner for this technique or else it might get a little
2:44draggy and we don't want that
2:46not for your delicate eyes find the natural contours of your eyes but
2:52instead of marking it here
2:54go a tiny bit higher to elevate your eyelid shape
2:58I know this sounds weird but trust me take your blending brush and blend out
3:01the upper line for a softer look
3:06Carol it up and sweet generous coats of your favorite lash lengthening mascara
3:18lashes are a nice I accessory to play around with
3:22but some parts of the world people wear fake lashes every day
3:25it's part of their daily routine and that's why it's important for them to
3:29find fake lashes that feels like you're wearing nothing at all
3:32remember when I elevated my crease line higher
3:36well it's because i'm going to use my favorite eyelet 8 by dup it's a Japanese

4:38the lip color focus on the middle section of your upper and bottom lip

1:46pigmented shadows to prime the lids as well as the top and bottom lash line
1:50I primary will help boost the color intensity of your shadows

2:02and line the eyes with a bold color of your choice

0:16hey everyone i have here an edgy look for you to try out
0:32have your face foundation ready and let's go
0:35because this look is so I heavy fill in and shape your brows first your brows
0:40are the frames to your eyes for this look I recommend keeping your brows skin
0:45here with a higher arch you want to find a brow pencil that has a whack space so
0:50that when you fill them in the wax will lay the hairs down so that they don't
0:54stick up just create little strokes and watch your brows magically come to life
1:01try and use a fully to blend out the marks to help soften the look so that
1:05your brows don't look as if they're drawn on
1:08but for some of you who don't need to fill in your brows well aren't you lucky
1:13using hear my new york city smokies palette or just find any silver smoky
1:18eyeshadow palette apply a shimmering pale peach color on your legs
1:22the trick to using silver eyeshadow is to make sure your base is warm
1:26silver can make your eyes look a little bit too cold
1:30like steel so warm it up with a soft color
1:33now select the metallic medium gray color and using a small brush create an
1:40edge by following the natural line of your I dabbing the brush along the way
1:44and once you have the cat eye shape fill in only the outer corner of your eyes
1:50leaving the rest of your I clean
1:54ok so now that you have your vixen cat eyes in place
1:57let's break out your liquid liner i'm using here my new scribble liquid liner
2:01that just launched in tattoo black
2:03I decided to name its Gribble because you can create thin and thick lines with
2:07the flick of the brush if you want to find the perfect liquid liner
2:11look for a brush that's flexible and can give you the greatest control the
2:15formula has to be smooth
2:17you should be able to create the perfect line with ease
2:20no skipping or dragoness so draw your lines so that it contours with the cat
2:25eye and if you want to go a little more Egyptian on this look because it's so
2:29popular draw another thin line under the first one for that exotic look
2:36take your time when you're creating your new lines we all know that liquid liner
2:40is not the most forgiving beauty product but once you've mastered the line you
2:44can create endless looks alright just curl your lashes and give them a few
2:49good squeezes your lashes are supposed to look curled not cramped and from here
2:56just apply a clean lash lengthening mascara
2:59I would avoid dramatic lashes since this look is all about the eyeliner and if
3:04you want to balance out your eyes
3:06just apply mascara on your lower lashes
3:19of course i'm using here my favorite water liner in rose gold
3:24i'm going to apply this along the inner corners of my eyes and water line to
3:27help brighten them up
3:36and because i'm feeling a little fancy i'm going to add silver lining inside
3:40the empty eyeliner space and if you're feeling ambitious create a very very
3:46thin outline along the cat eye shape
3:57this is going to give you a fun graphic look
4:00yeah
4:01from here just contour into your thing because this look is so sharp and edgy
4:07I want my nice to look a little more defined

4:18of your ice
4:22and just blend that bottom lash line out for a smoke your look
4:32we're almost done sculpting your cheeks with a bronzer load of your brush and
4:40locate the natural shadows for your cheekbones are and accentuate the shadow
4:44by shading the bronzer around here

0:05about you
0:06all right start out with a bare face and let's get to work
0:11the dab of foundation can go a long way
0:15look for a product that has a matte or shine free finish with the foundation
0:20brush or a sponge create and natural skin texture on your face
0:24this will help create an airbrush finish
0:28make sure everything is blended away and let's move on to the next step
0:33powdering your face if you want to maintain the longevity of your face
0:39makeup use a matte powder
0:41try not to use powder all over your face just along the areas under the eyes
0:45around the nose chin forehead to reduce shininess dab away and set the powder
0:51concentrating under the eyes and on the t-zone
0:54once you're done with foundation and powder let's move on to your brows
0:58perfectly arched dark brow helps to find this look
1:06if you really want to perfect the arch of your brows try drawing
1:09indistinct line through the brow to give you direction and shape and afterwards
1:15just fill it in and blend away try experimenting with different color
1:18shades for your brows
1:20you might be surprised by how much it can change up your look
1:23and now that you have the perfect base in canvas
1:27it's time for the fun part adding color and definition
1:30i'm using here this nice matte multiple it's perfect for a matte look you want
1:35to use a product that has a strong color payoff
1:37so that you just need a little bit less is more
1:41another way to use matte multiple is too wet your hands first and then touch the
1:45multiple and start applying the product on your face and just passed this on
1:50your cheeks for that second skin finish your contour shade should always be Matt
1:54shininess draws more attention to features and makes them more prominent
1:59while darker matte shades creates more depth and once you've laid out your
2:03color blend away to shear perfection
2:20I'm all about multifunctional tools so the more ways you can use a product
2:24better if you want a more bronze kiss look use this along your forehead for
2:29that summer look
2:38just keep lending away and let's move on
2:45on the eyes Matt of shadow is all you need
2:48this is an essential must have color for your eyes especially if you need to
2:53contour your eyes
2:54add this along the hollows of your eyes to create more depth
2:57my sig and using a dark brown color line your eyes
3:01upper and lower to create the illusion of bigger looking eyes
3:14pop of color like pink is perfect for the cheeks
3:18even though the product is matt still brings life in dimension back to your
3:22face
3:23rosy pink cheeks are perfect for spring look to add this on the high points on
3:27your face
3:33all right you know this step curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for
3:37mascara
3:38once your lashes are curled apply a volumizing mascara that you can build up
3:43with several codes from there
3:49finish up your lips with a rosy pink matte color to soften your look if you
3:53want balance you need to have the opposite
3:56so i'm using here a metallic rose gold eyeliner on my waterline to help right
4:01in my eyes
4:02just because we're creating a matte look doesn't mean everything has to have a
4:05matte finish
4:06I'm all for shiny hair once it starts looking Gracie
4:11we should fix this that's why a dry shampoo is a must have for me if you
4:17want to stay on trend find a bright pastel nail color shiny or not using a
4:22mattifying top coat will instantly modify your nails or you can you Steve
4:30- have fun trying this new spring trends that make up that hair and nails
4:35don't be scared to experiment you never know what you'll discover
4:44have fun and good luck
5:00yeah
0:00a selfie is like a self-portrait you want to capture the best version of
0:05yourself right
0:06and after that there are so many filters you can choose to help enhance your
0:10picture
0:11well in this video I'm going to show you how to enhance your skin without the
0:15need of a filter
0:16let's start with basic skin care step one cleanser use a cleanser that works
0:22for your skin type is it tries boilie normal or a combination like myself real
0:28of them
0:29if you have a dry skin type use the cream cleanser and if it's oily use a
0:33gel cleanser and if you're looking to exfoliate your skin wash your face with
0:37a washcloth to gently scrub away to reveal perfectly polished skin feels
0:46gonna step number two you
0:49I cream
0:51and you really just need a pea sized amount
0:54use your ring fingers and start patting it on like this
0:59your ring finger is the most delicate finger try not to stretch or tug this
1:03area around just softly have the product around your eye area
1:07step number three skin serum a sara is very concentrated
1:12two pumps is all you need to do and apply this all over your face and neck
1:19think of a ceremony like a supercharged booster for your skin care routine
1:23some are made to help reduce aging and at me others can brighten and repair the
1:28skin
1:28step number four moisturizer or lotion a dime sized amount is all you need and
1:36apply this all over your face and neck after washing your face that healthy
1:40sebum layer is gone
1:41so by using moisturizer you're recreating that barrier to keep
1:45hydration locked in a lot of moisturizers can prevent water loss next
1:50step lip balm
1:51i'm assuming most of you are already using a lip balm
1:55if not find a lip balm that works well for you no different from using a
1:59moisturizer on your skin
2:00lip balm will help keep your lips from drying out locking moisture in
2:04no makeup all skincare
2:06get your foundation and blush ready i'm using here my love me for me foundation
2:11in shell number nine and then with my rounded foundation brush start applying
2:16the foundation around the center of your face and forehead first cover up any
2:20redness and even out your skin
2:23after foundation if you need to cover up any spots or dark areas use concealer
2:29most people have dark circles so it's not a big deal with people see you with
2:33them but then again i know people who look better with their dark circles
2:37kind of like a vampire but if you look more like a zombie
2:41try to reduce them by lightly concealing them it's not about erasing them
2:45it's about lightening up the dark area will make a huge difference
2:49see before we finish the face makeup
2:52you have to seal everything in with powder you can either use translucent
2:56powder or a powder that has coverage like the one I'm using here like
3:00foundation start around the center of your face and move out so that in photos
3:05of filter won't be needed to perfect my skin
3:10and right now if you purchase ends love me for me powder compact you get a
3:14matching foundation for free
3:16all right let's get back to this tutorial for my brows if i'm looking for
3:19a softer look I prefer using a brow powder or an eyeshadow that matches your
3:24brow color you want to make sure you're using an angled eyeliner brush to give
3:29you better precision when you're creating your brow shape I like to draw
3:32a line on the bottom of my brows first so that I can see what my brows will
3:37look like before filling them in and from there
3:40just make little strokes to create the illusion of brow hairs and lightly brush
3:45with a spoolie to soften your browse
3:46ok we all know this step curling the lashes my lashes are not curly and they
3:52grow straight down so i personally have to curl my lashes to lift them up
3:56however if you have naturally curly lashes well aren't you lucky ducky use
4:01the lash lengthening mascara because we want long clean looking lashes
4:05alright final step taking care of your hair I color my hair a lot lately i've
4:11been using leaving conditioner and hair oils to replenish my her
4:16yeah
4:17so we're done no filter needed good skin care and foundation
4:22never hurts but a smile is all you need
4:26good luck
4:44we like
4:46hey
4:49the script
4:57yeah
4:59yeah
0:00you know there are days when you just can't get her hair to look right
0:04but then we have those days when we look and feel like the Queen because I want
0:13my skin to look flawless
0:15i'm going to be using face primer first I actually recommend this product for
0:19guys who want to reduce shiny face without the makeup look smooth this all
0:24over your face and let's move on to concealing take your favorite concealer
0:29i'm using here my trusty old great cover up concealer and with my Beauty Blender
0:33sponge I have right here i'm going to show you my current face makeup routine
0:37with a little bit of concealer on the sponge
0:40I'm dabbing a Touch under my eyes to brighten and conceal any of the dark
0:44areas and sometimes what I'll do is add a lighter concealer shade around my
0:49cheek area to create the illusion of fuller looking cheeks so just smooth
0:54everything out and powder up
0:56you can either use a sponge a powder brush or a powder puff to gently apply
1:01the powder on the area where you used concealer or foundation if your
1:05foundation or concealer has a matte finish
1:08you can skip this step all right time for the brows
1:11i'm going to be using two pencils and a brow filler to create my brow look for
1:16today
1:17I'm taking my brow pencils here called arch and using a color that matches my
1:21draw hair
1:22I'm going to fill in my brows if you naturally have full brows
1:25you might not need much work however for me I have to literally draw my brows on
1:31by creating feathery strokes
1:33once you're done creating your brow shape an extra step I like to do is add
1:37a brow filler brush this over your brows and you'll notice right away how natural
1:41they look find an eyeliner or eyeshadow in an amethyst color and outline the
1:46outer third of your eyes
1:48what you want to do is create a wing shape just by following your natural
1:52contour and from here
1:54just fill in the line is if you're coloring in a leaf you want to make sure
1:58to leave the center of your lids empty and from here with the brush quickly
2:02smudge the color to create a soft gradation you can use a blending brush
2:06if you need it
2:07using here a teal or turquoise color outline the outside of the amethyst
2:12color
2:12don't cover up the purple take the color down along the outer lower lash line and
2:17stop at the halfway point just blend in the deal so that it has a nice smooth
2:22transition into the purple patil and amethyst combination will create this
2:26multifaceted effect

3:41because of the liquid liner
3:44we don't want the eyeshadow to have a hard edge keep it soft and help balance

5:48a little skipping

0:03Ben and I were fighting this shark and science cat and I lost track of time
0:07anyway I'm here now milady and I have brought to you half an orange LOL nice
0:16now make that green there dude yeah that's good
0:21oh and young ja okay yep
0:24again can be actually dad and that's better
0:29hi had to make sure my translator was on so what do you get when you combine a
0:34unicorn with a rainbow a Rainicorn inspired by one of my favorite
0:39enchanting characters in Adventure Time Lady has perfectly pink skin
0:44so begin by lightly stippling on a base of BB cream or liquid foundation
0:49I prefer using a BB or CC cream because it feels lighter than foundation
0:54plus it has a moisturizing base will also help moisturize your skin - BAM
1:00the power of good concealer is pretty much as good as magic
1:03you can use your ring finger to blend or do what I'm doing taking the back of the
1:08brush and having to blend
1:10all right now we take a cherry red lip balm and dab it on the lips to prep and
1:15soften them for later
1:16I'm gonna throw on some blue contacts circle lens better yet if you want to
1:21give your eyes a more magical lip and now that your eyes are magical next step
1:26will require crime in your eyes I'm using here a champagne shadow primer
1:30gently dabbing it on my lids
1:38with the ring finger apply a bright yellow on the center of the lid
1:43this will be the base color for the rainbow with another clean finger or a
1:55brush apply a sky-blue along the outside corner of the eye pad on and blend
2:01around the corners to soften the edge node of your brush with the shimmery
2:10lighter blue and blend into the crease adding as you move along the eye for
2:15more control
2:23take a blending brush and blend to soften the edge
2:28let's try to keep this looks soft like a cotton Kenny and now take a hopping
2:34shadow and to create that beautiful rainbow effect take a flat side shadow
2:38brush and dab this color into the crease you want to try and keep the line subtle
2:42pink is a very strong color if you used too much it might over on the ice
2:48a rainbow is created when light is reflected through droplets of water in
2:52the sky to give that shimmery effect of water droplets apply a sparkly shadow on
2:57the brow bone the next color will be purple with a smaller brush at this
3:02along the lower lash line to balance out the eyes
3:04you want to make sure to add a cooler color on the bottom since we have pink
3:08on top on the inner corner of the eye by the tear duct apply a shimmering white
3:13shadow to brighten up this look
3:17all right take out your black liquid liner gently feather out a black liquid
3:24liner on the top corner of the eye
3:26keep the line thin we want to make sure that your eyes are as open and as round
3:30as possible
3:31just like ladies so that means curling your lashes and applying generous coats
3:35of mascara
3:43Lady Rainicorn doesn't have very defined eyebrows
3:50so this brow look is really up to you I want to try and keep this natural
3:54looking so gently
3:56fill in your brows with the neutral tone color close to your natural hair color
3:59because I'm wearing a blond way to match ladies here
4:05brush a little bit of a blonde brow gel over your brows to lightly 10 them to
4:14really make the eyes pop line the bottom waterline with a rose gold liner
4:18this will really open up your eyes more for the lashes
4:25I need a little more help in this department so i'm going to apply
4:28individual lashes the trick for this step is to use a clear glue and to apply
4:34with the term user so that you have better precision
4:36ok so now you're ready to move on to the rest of the face for your cheeks are
4:42rosy pink cream blush will do the trick
4:45apply this on the upper cheek bones and blend it out with a fluffy kabuki brush
4:50because you might need a little more definition around the cheekbones take a
4:54bronzing blush powder and apply this on the apples of the cheeks
4:58blending to the outer corner of the face as you go
5:03Lady Rainicorn has a delicate small mouth
5:06so if you have bullets take your concealer that matches with your skin
5:10tone and erase the sides of your lips
5:12this is going to create the illusion of a smaller mouth
5:16you want to make sure to blend so it doesn't get cakey and after this just
5:21powder to make sure the concealer doesn't slip inside
5:25all right time for some color use a pink or a rose lip color and apply this along
5:31the opening of your mouth to create a sweet delicate look this look is very
5:37innocent looking perfect for a lady
5:41all right now your magical look is complete
5:45magical colorful and completely adorable
5:48this is Lady Rainicorn
6:00now all you have to do is learn Korean and find your boyfriend Jake
6:13oh okay Cisco
6:16Oh responded to our calls out about vision to study English gonna buy this
6:22one device against me on a penguin or media and that means good luck
6:30ingredients
6:43yeah
0:00giving it again again again and that's winning game that swing game and that
0:03swing and again again again again
0:06a few minutes me and the roaring twenties i think i was born in the wrong
0:15era but with a little help from my friend called makeup
0:19I can transform myself into the ultimate flapper girl
0:22let's start off with foundation to help even out your skin with the stippling
0:25brush sponge or your clean fingers
0:28apply your foundation on your face I prefer to apply my foundation first
0:33around the center of my face because I need a little more coverage here then
0:38the rest of my face
0:39like forehead engine just make sure to blend so you don't have any Street marks
0:43especially down towards your neck
0:46all right let's move on to the heavy duty stuff
0:50concealing i'm curious to know what kind of makeup they use during the twenties
0:55to achieve perfect looking skin
0:57today we use stuff like a peachy salmon concealer color because it works wonders
1:02on covering up dark circles
1:04I prefer to use my gentle ring finger to apply concealer along the delicate area
1:09under my eyes
1:10all right this step is important applying finishing powder on your face
1:14to set the liquid and cream base makeup
1:17this will stop it from creasing and will also keep your makeup looking fresh all
1:21night long to make sure your skin has a matte finish
1:24let's move on to the fun part making up the eyes I'm using here my new brow
1:29pencils that just came in called arch by em cosmetics
1:33i'm using here the color medium brown and very carefully
1:36create your arch skinny over-exaggerated browse was the look
1:41unlike today where full brows are in back then
1:45every girl was drawing on her brows super thin just like Clara Bow 1920
1:50silent film star
1:51let's hurry up with eyeshadow with the medium brush loaded up with the matte
1:56taupe color and follow the natural contours of your eyes
2:04and once you're happy with how it looks
2:08the next color you should use is a matte black shadow and with the same brush use
2:13this to contour your crease again only this time it's going to look more
2:17intense in the taupe color
2:19what you're doing here is creating a strong contour shape to your eyes
2:23this will give your eyes more depth when I was coming up at this look I was
2:27really inspired by silent film movies
2:30be sure to keep the middle area on your legs clean will fill them in later
2:34so keep blending and bring the color down along the lower lash line
2:40this will help make your eyes appear more round use a shimmery my shadow
2:46add this on the area that you kept clean to fill it in with your brush again
2:51blend the shadow so that you don't have any harsh edge and using your black
2:59eyeliner here i'm using my water liner in black knight line the waterline
3:04gliding the pencil back and forth until you're happy with the intensity then
3:08bring the pencil up keeping the pencil as close to the lash line as possible
3:12and line your eyes
3:14we want to make sure that the line is as thin as possible so just keep darkening
3:18your eye makeup and with this measure tool smudge the creamy eye liner formula
3:22so that it gives your eyes a hazy look
3:31using another brush that has the same taupe color on it start where your brows
3:37begin and follow the line down the sides of your nose contouring your nose will
3:41help bring more definition to your face and after you curl your lashes apply
3:46generous coats of waterproof mascara
3:48why waterproof because it contains wax which will help hold a curl longer and
3:56when you're done with your eyes
3:57let's move on to the lips but first we have to reshape them
4:01this is a modern take on the Clara Bow lips with the concealer that matches
4:06your skin color start erasing the sides of your lips
4:09he want them to look smaller than normal we're creating very delicate shaped lips
4:14imagine if your lips were shaped like a heart that's kind of what we're going
4:18for
4:18so conceal a small portion of your upper lip and blend the concealer so that it
4:23looks as natural as possible using your powder again set the makeup
4:28you can't skip this step or else your lipstick and concealer will slip and
4:32slide find a rich red lipstick with the matte finish here i'm using my new matte
4:37lipstick in wine stain using a brush line your lips first then fill in the
4:42color you want your Cupid's bow to look extra point II think of it like two
4:46little mountain peaks
4:50haha you're not done yet
4:53you got a layer a darker plum color over the red to create a gorgeous rich
4:57vintage-inspired color so keep lending way did you know that back then it was
5:03extremely fashionable to be seen applying lipstick in public
5:07ladies would apply their lipstick and powder their faces right at the
5:11restaurant table
5:12there is no need to run to the bathroom for touch-ups and voila you're finished
5:16and now it's time to play dress-up

0:13already have puffy eyes
0:15this will be a no-brainer but if you don't i'll show you how to recreate them
0:19all right let's start with the brows first i'm using here a dual brow powder
0:23set
0:24that's going to help me create natural looking brows
0:27I like to start at the bottom part of my brows and work my way up to reshape your
0:33brows until you're happy with the look
0:35remember they don't have to look identical identical looking brows can
0:38sometimes appear to artificial looking so if they're slightly off
0:43that's totally fine moving on to the eye makeup
0:46i'm going to use this L'Oreal eyeshadow quad that I've had for ages use a
0:50combination of the white and shimmering peachy pink and add this along the lower
0:55lash line highlight under your eyes to create an illusion of happiness
1:02now with this matte taupe or brown color
1:08softly create a line underneath the highlighting color this will give an
1:11illusion of a shadow use a combination of a darker Matt Brown along the outer
1:16part to create an illusion of depth and with your blending brush gently soften
1:21the make up to the point where it looks like a natural shadow
1:28now bring the highlighting color up and blend out this will help open up your
1:32eyes

1:41conceal any dark circles if you don't this will make your eyes appear more
1:45tired and instead of the cute puppy eyes you end up with baggy zombie is so

1:03more definition and shape

1:18to brighten up my eyes i'm highlighting the inner corners with the white
1:22shimmery eyeshadow
1:28to help bring in more definition to the eyes line the lower lash line and then
1:32connect it to the upper lash line
1:40and of course curl your lashes and apply mascara with this look
1:45I definitely want to add more volume with my lashes so it's time to add some
1:48false lashes
1:50you want to try and cut the lashes first and with the glue still a little bit
1:54tacky place the lashes on your upper lashline building the lashes as you go

2:20afterwards I'm going to contour my nose and highlight the bridge of my nose and
2:24right above the cheekbone
2:25this will help bring in more definition to my face
2:28taking a red lip liner line the lips and fill it in with the color
2:38and then just finish it off with a lip brush as red tends to move easily over
2:42the lip line
2:43i also like to punch up the lip color with a little bit of gloss on the center
2:46of my lips to create an illusion of fuller looking lips and now you're ready
2:51to walk down the aisle looking glamorous but you can easily change up this look
2:55and make it more sultry with a few minor changes you'll be keeping the same eyes

3:08help brighten up the eyes
3:12apply a brown shadow to the outer corners of the eyes in a v-shape and
3:16work it into the crease to create more depth and definition to the ice

0:00becoming a bride is one of the most special days in a woman's life
0:04it's a day where your life is forever joined with another and it's a magical
0:08moment that you will always remember
0:13wedding season is upon us so it's a perfect time to show how to get a
0:17natural makeup look for your wedding day
0:19first find a foundation or BB cream that is as close to your natural skin tone as
0:24possible and then use your fingers to apply the product all of your face and
0:28with my new favorite rolling sponge
0:30I'm going to blend out this product I know it looks like I'm paint rolling on
0:34my face but it really works
0:36the next step is perhaps the most important step concealer when choosing a
0:41concealer try and find a shape that's two shades lighter than your foundation
0:44many brides don't get a lot of sleep leading up to the wedding so concealer
0:48is key
0:49unless you have a zombie themed wedding try and find a concealer that has a good
0:53coverage and now just finish off the face with loose translucent powder to
0:57modify the skin
1:00you
1:00because this is a very natural look i'm filling in my brows with the matching
1:04color to give my browser more polished and clean look
1:10and from my eyeliner i'm just going to use a dark brown eyeshadow color and
1:14lightly
1:15I'm going to line my upper lid next step illuminate the eyes
1:19what I'm going to do here is I'm going to highlight the inner corners of my
1:21eyes first and then the center of my lids and of course my brow bone to
1:26brighten up the ice
1:30to give my eyes a bit more definition I'm going to align it with the dark
1:34brown pencil I would try to avoid a black eyeliner because it can look a bit
1:38too harsh and now just curl your lashes and apply generous coats of mascara
1:50every bride has a glow on her wedding day whether its natural or makeup
1:54i'm going to show you how to get that beautiful bridal glow take a rose
1:58colored blush and added to the apples of your cheeks and then sweep it up the
2:02cheekbones for soft rosy glow
2:04then just take a light pink cheek stain to highlight your cheekbones for a
2:07luminous effect
2:11for a hint of color of my lips I'm taking a lip pencil and lining and
2:15filling in my licks
2:23as little girls we dream of what our wedding they will look like and then
2:27suddenly that magical day actually happens for all of the upcoming
2:31brides-to-be I wish you the utmost join your wedding day

4:08Day
0:00this tutorial today is inspired by the movie broken city where Catherine
0:08zeta-jones stars as the elegant wife of the New York Mayor start out their faces
0:18as usual and move right into priming the face i have here printing with the stars
0:23from benefit
0:24it's a kit filled with some benefits top picks
0:31using their eye shadow primer i'm going to . my entire eyes like this so that
0:35the primer is evenly distributed
0:42and with the delicate ring finger blend away
0:49timer not only helps with eyeshadow but it also helps with concealer
0:53so take your concealer the 1 i'm using here is from the benefit hit conceal
0:57your dark circles and eyelids and blend away with your ring finger
1:06and now the concealer is not going to smudge or settle into fine lines and
1:11once you're done just dab your eyes with loose powder
1:13this will actually help your makeup last longer and then let's move on to eye
1:17makeup for the I make apart i'm going to be using Lorax eyeshadow palette and for
1:23this tutorial I'm only going to be using my clean fingers to apply my eye shadow
1:28if you don't have any brushes or you forgot them on your trip
1:31no worries just make sure your fingers are clean and starting with your ring
1:34finger tap the base color on your lids gently dab it on like this
1:39pretty easy
1:42usually you want to use a smaller brush for the darkest color in this case we
1:46have our pinky finger the pinky finger will give you better control unlike the
1:51rest of the fingers with your pinky finger apply the darkest color along the
1:55outer corners of your eyes like this with the middle finger this should act
1:59like the fluffy brush blend everything together
2:01try not to mix up the fingers or else your eye makeup might end up looking
2:05muddy
2:10yeah
2:14whatever is left on your pinky finger apply this along the lower lash line to
2:18balance out your eyes
2:25for the highlighter let's use the index finger and apply this color along the
2:29brow bone and center of the lid to add more dimension to your eyes
2:36now let's take a bronze eyeliner or eyeshadow and add this along the inner
2:40corners
2:41usually if you want your eyes to have more of a doll like look use highlighter
2:45but if you want a more mature look a darker color along the inner corners
2:49like this using your black eyeliner line your eyes
2:52what i'm doing here is building up my line by making tiny little strokes
2:56filling in any empty spaces until I have one solid line
3:15time to curl the lashes and get them ready for mascara
3:22i'm going to be using to face better than false lashes mascara here at the
3:26lash extension system where you prime the iceberg build up the lashes and then
3:30seal everything in
3:34first step I'm going to wet my lashes with mascara
3:40and while the mascara is still wet and using their lash fiber one here i'm
3:45going to add a generous amount of their fiber onto my lashes
3:49this is going to help build up my lashes so that they're longer with more volume
3:52and now just steal everything in with the same mascara from step one
4:02not bad right it actually looks like i'm wearing fake lashes
4:06all right on to the next step browse her brows have a higher arch than my natural
4:10brows so I'm going to have to arched eyebrows a little higher than usual to
4:14recreate her brows
4:16finally we can move on to the face i am using here of foundation
4:20faker from the benefit apparently it's an oil-free cream to powder formula that
4:24perfects your complexion but it's not a foundation
4:27this is a really nice product but i only recommend it for those who have a good
4:31complexion because the coverage is pretty light
4:34if you need more coverage is better to use a foundation steal everything in
4:39with your powder
4:42and let's move on to the cheeks using tarts flesh
4:49I'm going to contour my face with this color applying it on the apples of my
4:52cheeks and brushing it out again
5:00intensify the contour by applying bronzer bronzer will give your face more
5:05dimension by creating shadow and whatever is left on your brush just add
5:08this along the sides of your forehead to create an illusion of a smaller forehead
5:17with an illuminator or highlighter at this on the tip of your eyeshadow brush
5:22and then start dabbing it along the highest points on your face your brow
5:26bone your cheekbones
5:28your skin will instantly look as if it's glowing giving you a healthy looking
5:32complexion
5:33since I'm kind of in a fancy mood i am going to use is Dolce & Gabbana bronzer
5:38scourges this is what the bronzer looks like honestly I didn't want to use it
5:42and I saved it just for this video so here goes
5:46as you can see the first application will be intense because of the black
5:50pigment from the leopard spots so make sure to really really blend
5:54after all the leopard spots are gone it's just going to be a normal bronzer
5:58for the lips i'm going to give them a mini spa by exfoliating all the flaky
6:02skin off
6:03this is the victoria's secret lip scrub scrub it's are made out of sugar so if
6:07you really want to make your own sugar lip scrub just add sugar to Vaseline and
6:11use that as a scrub instead
6:13wipe everything off with the tissue and your lips should be baby butt smooth
6:16apply lip balm as usual and get ready for lipstick finish off your lips with a
6:21beautiful warm nude lip color
6:35and now you're finished I love wearing bright colorful makeup looks but
6:39honestly I prefer simple natural looking makeup
6:43this is a very simple classy look that can be worn to work dinner in school so
6:48i hope you guys enjoyed this video

0:22you want your skin to look at it has to feel good
0:25hydration is key and josie maran argan oil is currently my must-have for supple
0:30smooth skin
0:31Arjun oil provides incredible moisture retention because the oil contains
0:35eighty percent unsaturated fatty acid and is more stable in sunlight than any
0:40other antioxidants
0:41so it's perfect to wear during the daytime it has natural healing benefits
0:45for scars and can reduce skin inflammation
0:49because it has high levels of vitamin E it's an effective anti-aging oil next
0:55step skip foundation and try either a tinted moisturizer or BB cream
1:00contrary to popular belief BB cream was invented back in the nineteen fifties by
1:04German dermatologist
1:06it was made for patients who had recently undergone surgery
1:09the purpose of BB cream was to protect the skin all while providing a light
1:13coverage for the wear today BB cream is also known as blemish balm or beauty
1:18balm and is an all-in-one face product that contains added benefits like
1:22sunscreen
1:23Sarah moisturizer primer and foundation think of it as your one stop shop for
1:28the face if you're not a fan of foundation or if you're not allowed to
1:31wear foundation try BB cream instead let your parents know that it's a sunscreen
1:36and skin care product that slightly tinted after BB cream powder the face as
1:40usual or modify the face by using oil blotting sheets when it comes to makeup
1:45i recommend all teenagers to redefine the brows try not to over pluck your
1:49brows the fuller the better but try to reshape them nicely when it comes to the
1:53brows it's all about finding the right shape for your look and if i get a lot
1:57of thumbs up I'll create a video on how to reshape your brows four different
2:01looks
2:02for my everyday eyeliner look I like to keep it really simple
2:05I'm going to load up my soho angled brush with my black eyeliner and of
2:09course line my eyes
2:10the trick to keeping it as natural as possible is to stay within the lash line
2:14area gently feather the liner out so it fades away softly and let's move on to
2:19curling the lashes hear what I'm doing is conditioning my lashes using the our
2:29general for all your mascara lovers you know how brittle your lashes can feel
2:33just like the hair on your head it's kind of nice to give your lashes and
2:36deep conditioning love
2:38if you're consistently conditioning your lashes every day you'll notice that
2:41they'll grow longer and feel stronger after conditioning your lashes apply
2:46mascara as usual to make your eyes pop
2:49I'm going to keep my makeup really simple by just adding highlighter on my
2:55eyes and face using my blush paper here by my couture
2:59I'm just gonna fold it up so I can easily use it on my eyes
3:02dab it on like so and blend out with your fingers
3:06I'm gonna like a hundred you can add highlighter along the inner corners of
3:14your eyes to give them a radiant look
3:17in 10 chance
3:20I gotta take a break
3:22and just finish it all off on your cheek bones to give your skin that luminous
3:25glow
3:28you wanna know
3:30I admit I am the worst when it comes to moisturizing my body but this year I'm
3:34going to make it a habit to moisturize every day using here my pacifica tuscan
3:39blood orange body butter
3:41i am going to moisturize all the dry areas on my skin like elbows knees feet
3:46hands and pretty much the rest of my body because it's really dry
3:50let's try our best to avoid chalkboard arms and legs and moisturize every night
3:54and my sister here Christine is going to show you how she did her braids
3:58she told me that she learned how to braid hair from soccer practice
4:01by learning how to braid her team members here so i guess everyone was
4:04sitting in a circle and braiding each other's hair doesn't matter what future
4:11crazy dream to avoid flyaways and hair sticking all over the place
4:18take them down by hair spraying them down using my big sexy hair hairspray
4:23i'm going to set our hair in place and pat down the flyways
4:30here
4:32maybe and for the nails i'm going to use here my nail teeny polish provided by
4:38fc's January glam bag and with a toothpick or a needle coat your nail
4:43with the Polish and make sure it's really nice and wet and while it's still
4:47wet
4:47add a few dabs of green and layer them on top of each other
4:50quickly add a few drops of red and do this as fast as possible
4:55we need the polishes to be wet because the next step requires you to take the
4:58toothpick or needle and marble eyes the colors together like this
5:02you're basically going to strike the colors together with your dotting tool
5:07make cute little white dots repeat the same steps to all your nails and that's
5:11pretty much it
5:13simple as that we're finished special thanks to my sister Christine for

0:19gonna warm it between my fingers and Pat the champagne colored primer on my eyes
0:24not only is this primary going to keep my eye shadow from creasing and
0:27transferring but the champagne color will create a beautiful base layer for
0:32any of the eyeshadow color you're going to apply over it

1:16the outer third of the eyes passed this along the area to create more depth
1:22hmm
1:24and bring the color along the lower lash line
1:27stay
1:30take this topic color and add this along the middle part of your eyes
1:34but remember to keep the center clean what this is going to do is add warmth
1:39to your eyes without making your eyes appear overly icy and cold looking be
1:43really careful and try not to apply too much or else the colors will look very
1:47very money using my learn mercy caviar stick in plum dab this along the outer
1:55edge to intensify to look
1:58yeah
2:00cool
2:03and with a little brush start blending everything out
2:07try and keep the gradation soft or else it might look overly dramatic
2:12take this I see shimmering eyeshadow color brighten up your eyes by rimming
2:16this along the inner lower lash line and apply it on the center related for that
2:20extra Sparkle
2:22mmm
2:27using a little bit of the caviar stick in the deep plum color line your eyes
2:31stay as close to the lash line as possible
2:34dad the brush along the lash line creating little - Marc's eventually
2:39what's going to start happening is that you're going to connect the dashes and
2:42it's going to help create a continuous line
2:47this is my
2:48what I have here is really nifty eyeliner by NYX called the curve
2:53apparently you hold it like this as if you're pointing and you're holding a
2:57liquid liner horizontally and what you're going to do is of course line
3:01your eyes and again notice how I'm making little - Marc's connecting the
3:07lines along the way i recommend it for any of you guys who are bored of doing
3:12the same old liquid liner
3:20yeah
3:23time for the brows using this honest - air kit
3:27i'm going to create fuller looking brows build up your browser by gradually
3:33adding more color to them
3:45fill in any sparse areas and use the spoolie at the end of the brush to blend
3:51everything away and now as you can see i have fuller looking brows
3:59it's time to curl your lashes and get them nice and perky
4:03can
4:07thank you
4:08i'm using this really interesting mascara by pop beauty
4:12it's called the peak performance mascara and it's basically a twist up come fan
4:16mascara
4:21mmm
4:21so what i'm doing here is i'm coming up through my lashes
4:25it's actually not that bad but you kind of have to get used to it
4:42using my trusty armani master corrector concealer
4:47this is one of my favorite concealers i really recommend it
4:50I'm going to erase my dark circles and any blemishes and redness on my face
4:54because I like using a formula that's really easily blendable and it's
4:58foolproof
4:59now that my concealer is set i'm going to powder my face using L'Oreal True
5:03Match powder
5:10yeah
5:13I
5:15on to the next step
5:20blush here I'm using benefits famous lip and cheek satin stain
5:24i'm going to use just a little bit to add a beautiful flesh to my skin
5:29using a cheek stain is a great way to create the most realistic looking blush
5:34because it won't look so powdery and it won't have any word texture it's going
5:38to blend into the skin and we'll give you a really nice beautiful satin finish
5:43ok here's another interesting one and again is my benefit
5:49it's called fine one one and it's basically a new all-in-one chic and
5:55lifted having the highlighter section on the highest point of my cheeks what I'm
5:59gonna do is I'm gonna make a swiping motion like this and basically it just
6:02takes two swipes blend away and you're pretty much done
6:06i'm using my current favorite lip cream by NYX in dali girl
6:14it has a silky glossy finish add just a little bit on your lips to create this
6:19beautiful velvety finish
6:21I'm wearing all ever eaten jewelry here which is actually my own jewelry line I
6:26designed and this is from the new chapter to collection inspired by juliet
6:31from the romantic story Romeo and Juliet
6:34I star-crossed lover earrings it comes in three parts as you can see a gold
6:39half star that can be worn in front or behind the ear lobe and the backing of
6:43course and you also get a black diamond pave stone stud that can be worn alone
6:48or with the gold star
6:50here i have the dagger nail ring you can wear this on your middle index or ring
6:56finger
6:57personally i like to wear it on the middle finger and here is the glove of
7:01love handpiece that's definitely a statement piece
7:05I got to finish off the look with the crown of love head piece you can wear
7:09this in so many different ways and you'll instantly feel like a princess
7:12with this on
7:13so here's the finished no princess look it's a very soft romantic winter look my
7:19favorite part about this look has to be the eyebrows and cheeks
7:22I find that most people look more youthful with fuller looking brows and
7:26highlighter on the cheeks
7:28so if you're looking for a sweet innocent look this is a look for you
7:32Merry Christmas and of course they're black
7:38music by Mindy Gledhill hell
0:00I've been waiting to see the image you made such a terrible vengeance until a
0:07little drama you know the complicated doesn't appreciate the occasional twist
0:14mr. lon this look is inspired by the bond girl from the new Skyfall movie
0:24she has this dark family look that's perfect if you need a sensual holiday
0:28party look I can open up with my faux fur jacket because it's freezing out
0:33here
0:34start off with naked eyes and I'd like for you to meet matt from the bomb using
0:39their matte dark grey eyeshadow
0:40I'm going to fill in my brows so they're similar to sufferings
0:44sometimes i like to use pencil other times i like to use powder but in this
0:49case I want my brows to look really soft
0:51which is why I'm using powder next step using brow gel to set everything into
0:55place here im using shallow brow gel brow shells are great if your brows need
0:59more teaming it sets the hair in place so it doesn't stick around in different
1:03directions
1:04just one sweep of the brush is all you need with the same eyeshadow that you
1:08used on your brows start applying this on your eyes
1:10Pat it on like so and build up the color until you're happy with the intensity
1:17now with your angled brush start sharpening out the outer edge
1:24and do the same for the inner corners of the ice this will instantly give you
1:28vixen looking eyes
1:30now run the color along the lower lash line
1:33so the eyes are not too top-heavy this will balance out the eye makeup
1:37now with your blending brush softly blend the edges so it's not so harsh
1:43looking
1:50and once you're done take a black eyeliner the one I'm using here is by
1:53starlet line your eyes as usual
1:59winger your eyes just a bit and line your waterline to intensify this look
2:03more
2:04and take your brush to soften the eyeliner
2:12now you're ready for mascara
2:17carlashes
2:22using a volumizing mascara of your choice i'm using their real benefit
2:25apply generous coats of mascara and tell you happy
2:32yeah
2:34yeah
2:35and i'm going to use the bigger version of Matt to contour my face
2:40using a matte taupe color contour your nose
2:43this will add definition to your face
2:51the nail polishes that I used here is by nail teeny i recommend using a sparkling
2:55gold red or oxblood nail polish finish off the lips with the dark vampy glass
2:59here i'm using the daredevil color my moxie
3:07if you really want to pull off this look you want to try and keep your hair up
3:10and where the right outfit
3:11makeup is half the battle look for a lace dress and faux fur coat and this is
3:16the type of makeup - we're on our first tape
3:18it's kind of more if you want to catch someone's attention because it's
3:21beautifully bold good lack
0:00yeah
0:06yeah
0:35to get this beautiful hypnotic look have your face foundation ready and let's
0:43move straight into the eyes
0:44select a lilac eyeshadow color and apply this color on the outer corners of your
0:49eyes
0:49blend around this area and try to keep the rest of the eye area clean next step
0:55take a black sparkling color and sculpt this color on your crease and lower lash
0:59line
1:05with your blending brush blend everything out to create a subtle smokey
1:10effect
1:13load up your brush with the silver color and run this along the inner lower lash
1:18line
1:19this will help brighten up the eyes now take the silver glittering eye shadow
1:24color and with your finger
1:26just dab it on the center of your lids this will give your eyes a glamorous
1:30look
1:33and from here on up you can add more of the black eyeshadow to intensify your
1:38eyes
1:39just be sure to blend everything away you want this look to be extremely soft
1:43and hazy
1:44no hard edges with the smaller brush loaded up with a black eye shadow and
1:49line this on your waterline
1:50this will help give your eyes and edgy look
1:54and once you're done with the waterline just take your favorite black eyeliner
1:58here i'm using our liner and line your eyes
2:01I like to start with a thinner line and then taper out to exaggerate the shape
2:05of my eyes
2:06also don't forget to line your lower lash line halfway to balance out the
2:10shape of your eyes if you line it all the way it can sometimes make your eyes
2:14appear smaller
2:30yeah
3:11and now it's time for the lashes my lashes are not only thin but they grow
3:15straight down so i have to give him a lift
3:21when it comes to building up my lashes I prefer to use a two-step process where I
3:27use a mascara base to thicken and lengthen my lashes
3:31now that my lashes are nicely marinated with the CIL's booster
3:36I can now use my Hypnose star mascara this brush is really nice because one
3:41side is flat helping deposit a generous amount of product on my lashes
3:45while the other side is round which helps separate and lengthen my lashes
3:49this is going to give me a glossy finish so it's perfect for this look
3:59and now that my eyes are finished we can move on to the face
4:04since i'll be wearing a mask I'm going to contour my face first
4:09and then apply blush on my cheeks
4:12try not to add too much because it might overwhelm the face
4:18because we want more focus on the eyes just finish off with a light lip color
4:24tell me and now for the finishing touch
4:30yeah
4:36yeah
4:52yeah
4:54yeah
5:02yeah
5:12yeah
5:13yeah
5:24see

0:03the right makeup look
0:05nails what you're packing your bag and of course some fashion tips for your
0:08casual date night look at this thing and then was brewing
0:12let's start with a fresh face using the Marabella eyeshadow in semi formal
0:18it's a shimmery autumn brown color and using my soho smudger brush or use a
0:23dense dome shaped brush load up your brush with the brown color and apply
0:26this color on your legs and lower lash line then blend everything out
0:31applying a brown color all over your legs and lower lash line is a great way
0:35to help create a smoky look to your eyes
0:37taking a dark deep plum eye shadow line your lower and upper lash line with this
0:42color and then blend away
0:45remember try not to like the top part of your eyes
0:48we want the eyes to be a little bottom heavy for this casual look
0:53we don't want your eyes to look too bright we kind of want them to have
0:56almost like a sleepy look I know that sounds a little weird but honestly it's
1:00one of the few times and advocating a sleepy look next step
1:04carlashes some of you who don't need a corner lashes are so lucky my lashes
1:09grow straight down so i have two columns and then apply generous coats of mascara
1:15I like to do this trick where I take the mascara juan and hold it vertically and
1:20I give my lashes a few good swipes then afterwards I like to comb it through
1:24horizontally
1:26it really helps get more product on my lashes this trick is a great way to make
1:30it look like you're wearing eyeliner for the face
1:33finish it off with bronzer and blush personally i like to use bronzer first
1:38to sculpt and contour my face and then I like to use blush to add color
1:44and now we can finally move on to lips i'm going to use a bright pink lip gloss
1:48the one I'm using is by James cosmetic sparkle gloss and now that the makeup is
1:53done i'm finally going to show love to my hair my hair has been so dry so I'm
1:58going to use a split and repairing product called Carol's Daughter monoi
2:01repairing split end sealer
2:03it seals 93.3 percent of split ends by binding the separated ends of the hair
2:09keep in mind that trimming a hair is very crucial if you want it to be
2:12healthy
2:13however if you don't have time or you need that extra length for a special
2:17occasion
2:17this is a great product to use you can apply this product on wet or dry hair it
2:23will instantly feel nourished and now that my makeup is done
2:26it's finally time to dress up because my clothes are so simple just likings and a
2:32black oversized to it
2:33I decided to dress up my look by wearing this knee high boots
2:36it also helps toughen up the look my boots and bag are from justfab.com if
2:41you really like the boots and bag that I'm wearing here
2:44they're both for thirty nine dollars and ninety-five cents each on justfab.com
2:47when it comes to my bag
2:49it's important to pack my essentials I never leave the house without a
2:52concealer palette just case for touch-ups and of course a powder brush
2:56and press powder to keep my face shine free eyeliner both pencil and liquid for
3:01touch ups or if I want to intensify my eyes later on during the night
3:05lash curler to perk up my lashes during the night a smudger brush lip balm and
3:10of course my lip gloss
3:12I always make sure to carry water or drink in my bag
3:15it's really important to stay hydrated last but not least some restaurants will
3:20only accept cash
3:21so it's better to play it safe than sorry oh wait I forgot to show you my
3:24nail tutorial I'm keeping this look really simple and pretty
3:28using three of my favorite colors I'm going to make a few dots and with a
3:32brush soaked in nail polish remover dab it on the dot
3:35you'll notice right away that the nail polish remover is dissolving the drops
3:39of color
3:40keep having it around this will create a beautiful watercolor effect
3:45it's really important to apply top coat on top of your base color before adding
3:49the color drops or else the nail polish remover will dissolve your base color
3:53repeat the same steps to all your nails just have fun with it and when you're
3:57done just apply top coat and now your watercolor nails are finished and
4:02finally i'm ready to head out
4:04here's my outfit knee high boots are very in for autumn since the boots are
4:08so edgy with all the buckles
4:10I decided to pair it with my casual 10 bag to balance out the edginess of the
4:14boots
4:14ok now it's time to eat I give huge props to any restaurant with purse hooks
4:19I don't like having my back on the floor i recommend finding a sushi restaurant
4:22near university because they tend to be a little cheaper sushi restaurants are
4:27so fun because it requires you to share a menu with your date
4:31so you can talk and be really interactive with your date instead of
4:34just sitting there twiddling with your thumbs
4:36sushi is also very healthy you can eat a lot and not feel so bad
4:41and if you don't eat fish sushi restaurants usually carries chicken and
4:44vegetable tempura dishes
4:46this is actually how I break apart my chopsticks always breaks evenly and this
4:52is how I hold my chopsticks
4:54how do you guys hold your chopsticks do you hold it my way or his way
5:00salmon is my favorite fish and I love getting a spicy tuna handle
5:04what's your favorite thing to order the sushi restaurant to all the ladies out
5:07there if you can handle the bill
5:09do your thing but if you can
5:11trying to attempt to offering to help pay such a friendly gesture
5:15other than that just be yourself he should like you for you good luck and
5:19have fun on your date

0:49thinner
0:50you just need a few drops of nail polish and makes a tiny amount of nail polish
0:54remover in your mixing palette find a toothbrush with a hard bristle that

1:23then working with you one that a gril know
1:28I was cold and you knew
1:32I'm basically doing layers and layers until well it looks like this mess
1:38yeah i know but if this is a little too much for you
1:43I have another nail trick that you can mess around with that's a little more
1:46subdued i like to call it drip nails so get your colors ready and with a regular
1:51pencil just make random slowly marks like this
1:54you want to keep making these worlds with different colors
2:01basically just keep the drip pattern keeps swirling everything around
2:05think like a marble does that even make sense
2:09it may appear really thick looking on your nails but don't worry because it's
2:13going to dry them who is me
2:15you have to
2:17that's my
2:18kiss
2:20you're hot despite
2:27dip the pencil into the white nail polish and give it one last swirl and
2:32that's it
2:33once it's completely dry just top code it and you're pretty much ready to go
2:38alright so now for the makeup start out with your naked face
2:42yes I said naked I'm starting off with skincare first now with skincare i'm
2:47using equal 0 cellular activator facial serum first
2:50you know what the same it's a long name is going to work so what I'm using here
2:53is a serum basically a sara is like a liquid specialist they basically address
2:58specific needs some can be for wrinkles firming age spots whitening
3:03hyperpigmentation scars
3:05whatever it is there's a serum for it the molecule in serums are much smaller
3:09than the moisturizers molecule which means you want to use it right away
3:13because it will penetrate deeper and deliver all the goodness into your skin
3:17and don't forget to apply your moisturizer after sarren because you
3:20want to hydrate your skin even if you have oily skin
3:23you still have to use a moisturizer try using an oil free formula instead
3:28fun fact about this Brandi close it's actually a plant-based skincare line and
3:32their ceremony boys riser here has stem cells
3:35plant stem cells to be exact I wouldn't put human stem cells on my face
3:41all right moving on to sunscreen
3:44you're going to need at least SPF 15 so show your skin some love and protect it
3:50next step a little bit of foundation use it to even out your skin tone
3:56I know you guys keep hearing these sailors but I'm a huge believer that
4:00less is more
4:01far beyond the mismatch of person
4:05ah and using a sponge will help blend your foundation giving you that flawless
4:10airbrushed look please any next step using mineral powder again
4:18so when I was in Australia a really sweet subscriber name in gave me this
4:23amazing miracle in a red tube called luca's papa
4:27did I say that right guys anyways I love this stuff
4:30it's amazing you know what time it is everyone its brow time
4:35get in there and groom your brows nicely shaped browse will give your face more
4:39balanced
4:40this is bound to get messy but I don't care
4:45all right ladies you want to invest in a good neutral eyeshadow palette because
4:49the color taupe will go a long way using a brush or a sponge applicator apply
4:55this foolproof color as close to the lash line as possible and then the lower
4:59lash line
5:00taupe is a great contour shade it helps bring more dimension to your eyes and
5:05now it's time for the pretty eye shadow color using salty cosmetics loose
5:08eyeshadow powder in glamazon would focus around the inner corners of the eyes
5:13first
5:14it should be concentrated here and then blend out just a bit
5:19yeah
5:22the top was gonna need a little bit of that glamazon way to you see how subtle
5:26this makeup is it just comes to show you that you don't always need crazy colors
5:30to make a statement
5:33and whatever is left over on your brush or sponge brush it on your brow bone
5:38depending on your comfort level use a liquid liner to line your eyes
5:42the reason why I'm such a huge fan of liquid liners is because they tend to
5:46last longer
5:47that's what you're going to need for a long school day so line your eyes and
5:50draw another line to create fake lashes like this
5:53now it's time to curl your lashes and apply your favorite mascara you want to
5:58use waterproof mascara if your eyelids are oily or if you live in a really
6:02humid climate
6:06and cut the lower lash line ever using a waterproof formula
6:12me all right I sure does and now it's time for blush I'm using this creamy
6:18blush i bought at target
6:19apply a paint brush color around the apples of your cheeks
6:22usually when I wake up I look super pale so i need to add a little bit of life
6:27back into my face blush is the answer

6:43regular perfumes colognes soaps shampoos Kendall's their smell perfume oil has
6:48you know alcohol so won't irritate the skin it will last longer because the

0:30create a smooth canvas to work on with the liquid foundation that's a few

1:02tools that's great for blending and creating stuff looks
1:08with your favorite concealer to conceal any blemishes dark circles
1:14watching us anime girls have perfect skin and since no one really has perfect
1:19skin
1:19unless your baby you want to pack that concealer on your place with your powder
1:26set your makeup by powdering the foundation and concealer
1:33yeah
1:34powder helps set any texture that's moisture wet
1:38that's not dirty
1:48all right time for eyeshadow yes
1:51my favorite part using a luminous eyeshadow dab this all over your crease
1:56area aluminous eyeshadow adds color to your eyes without making it look like
2:01you're wearing eye shadow
2:05and with a copper color apply this shade on your crease and follow the natural
2:09contour on your eyes
2:11notice how this creates dimension to the eyes we all know your eyes already have
2:15dimension but with makeup or exaggerating it using a matte taupe
2:20color keep intensifying the contour of your eyes until you've reached that
2:24level of definition that you're satisfied with
2:27ok and now it's time to draw on your eyes if you're good at drawing anime or
2:34manga
2:35this will be easy peasy using a creamy black pencil eyeliner make sure it's
2:40creamy because we don't want the pencil to drag on your eyes right above your
2:44crease start drawing the outline of your anime I shape it should look like this
2:49a cat eye shape but way above the crease line
2:55take your matte black eyeshadow and start coloring in if you're good at
3:03coloring inside the lines as a child
3:05this should be no problem for you
3:10start sketching out anime lower lashes should be chunky and pointing
3:17and don't forget the upper lashes
3:20they should be skinny and pointing there are hundreds of different enemy I shapes
3:24that you can use if you need to use reference photos of anime or manga to
3:29help you find the one that fits your eye shape best
3:40hey don't play with the makeup take a bright color choice i decided to use a
3:44vivid purple color for this one
3:46apply the bright color along the upper and lower lash line of the eyes and
3:51softly blend it
3:52leave the middle part empty because if you fill it in it might look a little
3:56too dark and gothic
4:08with a champagne color dab a bit of this highlighter along the lower lash line to
4:15brighten up the eyes for this look it's all about making the eyes look bigger
4:20next step
4:23curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for mascara using your favorite
4:27mascara like my matches the color of my eyeshadow apply generous coats on your
4:32lashes keep building up your lashes you want sky-high lashes
4:37and if you still need help finish off the eyes with fake lashes break your
4:42lashes in so they're not too stiff
4:44kind of like breaking into your new jeans you know what to do apply glue and
4:47stick them on
4:53we're not done yet with your brow pencil failing your browser like you normally
4:59do
5:02but before you finish take an eyeliner pencil in the similar shape to your
5:09bright eyeshadow color my hair is purple and fill in your brows colored browse
5:14intensify the colors of your eye shadow
5:22with the matte bronzer or a matte taupe eyeshadow concert the sides of your nose
5:31this will make your nose look more skinny using a matte white eyeshadow

5:41illusion of a taller knows
5:44also apply this on the high point of your cheeks to bring out your cheekbones
6:01and with the bronzer you all know the deal
6:04contour your cheeks and add more definition to the face
6:09yeah
6:13and apply natural looking blush to add softness back into your face
6:27for the lips i'm going to use a nude lip liner because I'm going to make my lips
6:31look smaller by reducing the size of my lips
6:34I'm going to do this by erasing the edges of my lips the more you erase the
6:38outline of your lips
6:39the smaller your lips look your new lip pencil should be as close to your skin
6:43color as possible
6:46blend the pencil until you don't see any marks
6:51afterwards take a pink lips take and with a brush
6:55load it up and add the color on the center of your lips
6:58you want your lips to look softer and delicate because enemy lips are usually
7:02just a thin line
7:03you don't want the edges of your lips to appear too sharp keep in mind that the
7:07smaller and delicate your lips look the larger your eyes will look and if you
7:12really want your eyes look bigger
7:13pop on your enemy eyeballs also known as circle lens
