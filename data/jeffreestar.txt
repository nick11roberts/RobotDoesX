0:00what's up everyone welcome back to my
0:02
0:02channel now today I'm gonna be diving in
0:04
0:04and doing a first impressions on the new
0:06
0:06Kylie Cosmetics "the burgundy palette" now
0:10
0:10you guys know I loved the first one so
0:12
0:12when I saw these color hues and this
0:13
0:14color story I was like yassssss!
0:17
0:17because I love reds and I'll of
0:19
0:19Burgundy's and i just love bronze tone
0:21
0:21shadows
0:22
0:22this is what she looks like of course
0:24
0:24the same drips as before but this one
0:26
0:26has burgundy and pink and like topaz
0:29
0:29cheers and the other one of course match
0:31
0:31that palette so should we open her up my
0:34
0:34room it looks something like this
0:37
0:37now I think the color hues of this
0:39
0:39palette speak to me a little more than
0:41
0:41the first 1i can definitely play around
0:42
0:42with this more and i love rusty colors I
0:45
0:45love Burgundy's i love the transition
0:48
0:48colors in this palette now this palette
0:50
0:50is $42 and I know that Kylie said on
0:52
0:52snapchat that her next palette after
0:54
0:54this one would have a mirror so I know
0:56
0:56everyone's gonna be asking but this one
0:57
0:57does not have a mirror and which i don't
1:00
1:00care i get ready in my studio or on a
1:03
1:03vanity everyday with the mirror so i
1:05
1:05don't really ever use pallets and use
1:06
1:06the mirror maybe that's just me but I
1:08
1:08know a lot of people on the go and they
1:09
1:09do want a mirror so this one does not
1:11
1:11have it now of course these are just my
1:13
1:13thoughts and opinions remember i have
1:15
1:15been a makeup artist for 15 years I
1:17
1:17create my own formulas and i am very
1:20
1:20educated in the beauty world so of
1:22
1:22course people are going to run their
1:23
1:23mouth and say whatever they want about
1:24
1:24my thoughts but hey I always keep a hood
1:27
1:27bitch so let's get to some swatching and
1:29
1:29let's get to playing all right this is
1:31
1:31the first shade naked and of course
1:34
1:34excuse my broken nail i have a new dog
1:36
1:36and he loves to chew on things beyond so
1:39
1:39you see it has that really soft pretty
1:40
1:40shimmer to it
1:41
1:41poor sap tattoos so this is not going to
1:43
1:43show up like it went blank skin but here
1:46
1:46is the second shade beach it is a pretty
1:50
1:50around warm really nice transition shade
1:54
1:54here is the third shade is called
1:57
1:57pinning it is a really warm orange color
2:01
2:01BAM that is what penny looks like next
2:03
2:03shade is called la it is a really pretty
2:07
2:07frosty shade i think simply up the
2:09
2:09formula in her frost because this one is
2:12
2:12super pigmented and it is banging fifty
2:15
2:15shades called Burgundy
2:17
2:17it is a beautiful warm red color and I
2:22
2:22lived for this one and the sixth shade
2:25
2:25is called Dubai is a pretty frosty rusty
2:29
2:29red color and I lived for this one it is
2:34
2:34definitely way more pigmented and the
2:37
2:37last frost shades from the bronze
2:38
2:38palette and I live the seven shades
2:42
2:42called break it is a reddish tone brown
2:46
2:46really pretty
2:48
2:48BAM the next shade is called New York
2:51
2:51this is more deep bronzy color really
2:54
2:54gorgeous and of course it is a frost
2:56
2:56formula and the last shade is called
2:58
2:58almond it is a really pretty warm tone
3:02
3:02dark brown and it is Matt of course now
3:06
3:06i have a little bit of lotion on my
3:08
3:08finger so I'm just gonna add a little
3:09
3:09bit more
3:10
3:10alright so here are all the swatches now
3:13
3:13let's dive in and put some on my eyes
3:15
3:15now we're gonna be prying eyes with the
3:17
3:17Mac painterly Paint Pot of course if you
3:20
3:20have a favorite primer that you love now
3:21
3:21is the time to apply and get ready to
3:24
3:24blind so when I do these primers I like
3:27
3:27to take it from my lid all the way up
3:29
3:29almost to the lash line because I'm a
3:31
3:31sick bitch gonna pop a little transition
3:33
3:33color into my crease with this little
3:35
3:35Bobby Brown blending brush and I'm gonna
3:37
3:37be using shade beach which is the top
3:39
3:39middle shade so I'm just gonna pop this
3:42
3:42guy right in here
3:44
3:44of course this is going to help us blend
3:46
3:46out all of our darker shades later and
3:49
3:49just blend effort less Lee there we go
3:52
3:52girl gotta speak English for a minute
3:55

3:57
3:57it's good
3:58
3:58good and I'm just gonna take this and
4:00
4:00kind of go like this and kind of stop it
4:02
4:02here so normally all used to me going
4:04
4:04all the way down
4:05
4:05I'm just gonna keep this right here
4:07
4:07today and leave some room for some other
4:09
4:09shades and because i have no brows I'm
4:12
4:12gonna drag it a little out course if you
4:14
4:14are not me or jenna Marbles try shutting
4:18
4:18off your brows right now I know there's
4:20
4:20gonna be a lot of questions about the
4:21
4:21pigmentation how they blend now this
4:23
4:23first color blend it a really quick
4:25
4:25amazing so let's keep moving on now i'm
4:28
4:28going to be using shade penny which is
4:30
4:30the top right one and it is a warm
4:34
4:34orangie color which I you know I love a
4:36
4:36good little orange transition and I'm
4:38
4:38just going with a little mac 221 brush
4:40
4:40and we're just going to pop this into
4:42
4:42the crease and start adding some
4:44
4:44dimension and definition
4:46
4:46come on now now see how it's going to
4:48
4:48take this and stop it here again and
4:51
4:51we're just going to go slightly down now
4:54
4:54it's just add a little more warmth to
4:56
4:56the lid and the crease I'm gonna be
4:58
4:58going into the little stick my e57 brush
5:01
5:01now i don't know if i'm going to wet the
5:02
5:02brush with 6 plus yet it might not need
5:04
5:04it so I'm just going to go in here a few
5:07
5:07times
5:08
5:08oh ok ok might not need any fucking girl
5:11
5:11and I'm just going to do packing motions
5:14
5:14and go on my lashline blue right now I'm
5:18
5:18gonna merge Dubai with the other colors
5:21
5:21and we're just gonna pack this in and of
5:23
5:23course we're going to blend it it out
5:25
5:25better later but we're going to lay down
5:26
5:26the foundation of our left
5:28
5:28all right now a lot of the times with
5:30
5:30these colors there's a lot of fallout
5:32
5:32because of just a shade in the pigment
5:34
5:34but this is pretty good you guys my
5:36
5:36cheeks are not dusted and I'm just
5:38
5:38packing this in a really heavy and bam
5:41
5:41all right
5:41
5:41the lids are looking rusty and i love it
5:44
5:44now I'm gonna be going in with this deep
5:46
5:46topaz bronze color it's called la yes
5:50
5:50shut up to calabasas what's up Los
5:52
5:52Angeles i love the shade name ok so I'm
5:55
5:55going to be taking this guy and taking
5:57
5:57it all the way down to here and just
5:59
5:59kind of give
6:00
6:00get a little moment to just you know
6:02
6:02blind fucking my life so I'm gonna be
6:05
6:05using this little shader brush and
6:07
6:07sometimes i like to wet the brush to
6:09
6:09really intensify metallics but ok let's
6:14
6:14see what happens with this guy
6:19
6:19now this one feels really creamy already
6:21
6:21on the brush I haven't touched it with
6:23
6:23my finger but it feels really nice and
6:26
6:26it's blending into the other shadows um
6:28
6:28pretty great
6:30
6:30alright now we're going to go in with
6:31
6:31the bottom right shape this one is
6:32
6:32called almond it is a dark chocolate
6:34
6:34brown with a warm undertone and I'm
6:37
6:37gonna be going in with that same mac 221
6:39
6:39brush now I love these because the last
6:42
6:42one had a lot of kickback and was a
6:44
6:44little more powdery this one I think is
6:46
6:46a little more fine-tuned and the formula
6:47
6:48i think already just from playing with
6:50
6:50them is slightly better i think the last
6:52
6:52pilot was still fine and you know
6:54
6:54there's so many mixed reviews people are
6:55
6:55just crazy in general I think a lot of
6:57
6:57people seek out and want to hate
6:58
6:58something but so far so good and I'm
7:01
7:01loving how these are blending so I'm
7:03
7:03gonna take that shade almond and we're
7:05
7:05just going to lightly place it in the
7:08
7:08outer crease area just to darken my eye
7:11
7:11socket and give it some fall drop now
7:15
7:15I'm gonna be taking that same Bobby
7:16
7:16Brown blending brush and we're gonna go
7:18
7:18back into beach just ever so slightly
7:20
7:20and now we're just going to go over what
7:23
7:23we did earlier and just gonna drag it
7:25
7:25and blend it out just so it's a little
7:27
7:27more soft and dramatic soft dramatic
7:31
7:31work together is that that term I think
7:33
7:33so
7:33
7:33all right now I think I want to smoke up
7:34
7:34my entire bottom lashes with the middle
7:36
7:36shade and burgundy I think this is the
7:38
7:38start of the palette if you will
7:40
7:40I'm just going to be going in with the
7:42
7:42Tom Ford little pencil brush and I'm
7:44
7:44going to do liner in a second but I just
7:46
7:46kind of want to smoke this out and see
7:47
7:47how it looks
7:48
7:48I'm just gonna really gently drag it
7:51
7:51across my entire under I'm just trying
7:54
7:54to smoke this bitch out
7:56
7:56oh wow this is like really creamy like
7:59
7:59when I say smooth glide on
8:03
8:03I'm shockingly enough just because I've
8:05
8:05had bad experiences with other brands
8:06
8:06usually has a lot of red fallout but
8:08
8:08this one you know and I am clicking the
8:10
8:10brush but it's pretty good
8:12
8:12we're gonna go back with this guy and
8:14
8:14dip into that almond shade and was going
8:16
8:16to kind of blend them together and let
8:18
8:18them merge there now having a baby or
8:21
8:21they're dating
8:22
8:22alright guys this is coming together i'm
8:26
8:26really loving the smoky red eye look

8:31
8:31contact lenses today to give it a little
8:33
8:33extra ryan right there
8:35
8:35I think my brown eyes definitely could
8:38
8:38have worked but I just kind of wanted
8:39
8:39extra little you know this little
8:41
8:41pizzazz if you will right now for the
8:43
8:43last time we're gonna be dipping into

8:47

8:50
8:50my eyeshadows out i love a dramatic I i
8:53
8:53know a lot of people are like me i just
8:55
8:55love the effect of a really beautiful
8:58
8:58smoky eyes so I'm just gonna drag out
9:00
9:00the colors and bam all right now for the
9:04
9:04waterline i'm gonna be using this little
9:05
9:05Smith 202 brush look I'm tiny that is
9:08
9:08I'm like girl and I'm going to be using
9:10
9:10the tart black clay pot liner was going
9:14
9:14to be dipping into this ever so slightly
9:16
9:16it is a really creamy and really
9:17
9:17pigmented just how i like it and I'm
9:20
9:20gonna be taking a little beauty blender
9:21
9:21to hold down my eye and we're just going
9:24
9:24to tuck this in our water line
9:30
9:30alright BAM liner is done i usually i
9:33
9:33love to take a pencil liner and really
9:36
9:36make it so dramatic on the bottom but I
9:37
9:37want this red burgundy color to just a
9:40
9:40live and breathe and I because i love
9:43
9:43how it looks now I definitely think
9:44
9:44there needs to be some shimmer or
9:46
9:46something else below the brow so I'm
9:48
9:48gonna be trying this top sheet it's
9:51
9:51called naked
9:52
9:52it is a shimmery it looks almost like a
9:54
9:54beige type of color so hopefully it's
9:56
9:56not too dark for my skin tone but I just
9:58
9:58kind of wanted to add a little bit below
10:00
10:00the brow just for a little shimmer now
10:03
10:03i'm so used to putting like stark white
10:05
10:05colors below the brow that actually
10:07
10:07don't mind this it looks cool i'm only
10:10
10:10doing it from here i'm not gonna take it
10:11
10:11all the way in I just started from right
10:13
10:13here i'm just going to blend and merge
10:15
10:15those colors together all right now i
10:17
10:17think i'm gonna have to go in with this
10:18
10:18guy again and i'm just gonna buff and
10:21
10:21make those colors seamless this is
10:23
10:23coming together nicely you guys im
10:26
10:26feeling the fall fantasy
10:28
10:28alright i think the only thing missing
10:29
10:29is of course the lashes so I'm going to
10:31
10:31start by applying my benefit roller
10:33
10:33mascara roller lash if you will
10:37
10:37now this has been my tried-and-true for
10:38
10:38a long time and let's get to it
10:49
10:49all right now before I apply lashes yeah
10:52
10:52we gotta go old-school jeffree star and
10:54
10:54I think it's time to hit the roast court
10:56
10:56and just have a moment
11:01
11:01all right now for lashes i'm gonna be
11:04
11:04using in the what the fuck am I gonna be
11:06
11:06using to you guys think I'm going with
11:08
11:08the lower lashes the new style and I'm
11:11
11:11the damage that of course forgot the
11:13
11:13name of it so I know these just launched

11:45

11:48
11:48perfect but of course if you want to do
11:49
11:49green black blue or red please feel free

12:45
12:45final thoughts this palette is great i
12:48
12:48know so many people are gonna want to
12:50
12:50hate and be crazy and I know there's so
12:52
12:52many of you that love Kylie and you're
12:54
12:54like yes another amazing product from
12:56
12:56her so this video is of course just my
12:58
12:58experiences it blended amazing the
13:01
13:01formula was great i think the only
13:03
13:03shadow I wasn't obsessed with was the
13:06
13:06far top one it is a little more sheer
13:09
13:09than the rest but I remember Kylie
13:12
13:12saying that on snapchat she wanted to be
13:14
13:14a little more subdued so it's not a
13:15
13:15negative it's just personally I like
13:17
13:17really rich pigments think that she
13:19
13:19really improved the formula from the
13:20
13:20last palette even though i was a fan of
13:22
13:22that one I think that this one is better
13:24
13:24and that's just my opinion
13:26
13:26so I think it's awesome that she is
13:27
13:27improving the formulas and working on
13:29
13:29everything and definitely going to be
13:30
13:30using this and i love that it's you know
13:32
13:32perfect for travel it's a cute little
13:33
13:33light sighs so I think this is really
13:35
13:35good for going to kmart back-to-school
13:38
13:38being on your knees but no real i think
13:41
13:41this look is a really stunning and I
13:42
13:42want to see you guys created so find

5:33as usual and let's blow all the way on
5:44the brow bone even before this browser
5:46on there I'm like you know what I need a
5:48blind a Cupid's bow is getting a little
5:50lonely so let's give her a minute
5:53mmm
5:54hmm I really contour her a lot today so
5:57let's give the nose its little blinding
5:59moment I'm like alright make this makeup
6:01look is done i'm loving this by its oh
6:03whoa forreal highlighting is done now
6:07real quickly i'm gonna draw on browse
6:09off-camera and I'll be right back and
6:11now that the brows are on and they're a
6:13little more higher-than-normal Ohio
6:15consume a little beauty mark
6:16hi all right we're gonna prime in these
6:19lids with a little Mac painterly I'm
6:22just gonna go over my entire lid and up
6:25to my brow bone all right now I'm really
6:28excited for today's look because i'm
6:29going to be using the hood of beauty a
6:31rose gold eyeshadow palette now I know a
6:34lot of youtubers have used this and
6:36there has been as so many mixed reviews
6:39now I think from already using this
6:41off-camera for a few looks I understand
6:44some people's concerns about the top row
6:47now these are textured shadows on the
6:50box even says best applied with your
6:53fingers now when you have really long
6:55nails like me could be a little more
6:56tricky but that's what the pinkies for
6:58now I've noticed that if you really
6:59wanted the foil shadows to be a really
7:01highly pigmented on your lid it is easy
7:03to just go on with your finger and like
7:05Pat it on and it is a blinding with a
7:08brush it could be a little bit tricky so
7:10I'm just gonna do something a little
7:11cute and fun today and i'm going to
7:14start by going in with shade saddlewood
7:16which is this one all the way down here
7:18and we use a little shadow blending
7:22brush and we're just gonna pop this in
7:24our crease for our transition shade and
7:27lets blend
7:32now with another eyeshadow blending
7:35brush I'm going to take shade henna
7:37which is this one all right there and
7:39we're also going to put that in the
7:40crease and add a little bit more in
7:42jarama to the lid if you will
7:49all right now that is a blended and I'm
7:52gonna take one of those foiled shades
7:54this one is called a rose gold now it
7:57says to just use your fingers somebody's
8:00my pinky it is the skinniest nail home
8:03that I have now when you use this with
8:05your finger like that is full pigment
8:08someone's going to take this and oh ok
8:12ok now let me try to blend that with my
8:15finger it's really hard because my nails
8:17in the way so what I'm hoping is I can
8:21blend that in with a little synthetic
8:24bristle brush now here's the thing when
8:26you go in with a brush
8:28kinda shows but not as pigmented as the
8:31finger whatsoever so I'm just gonna try
8:33to go in and blend that up
8:36this is my favorite formula know if I
8:38had no nails would be a lot easier
8:40yes hundred percent now i am going to
8:43take a little detailing brush from Mac
8:46and we're going to dip into shade cocoa
8:48which is this beautiful chocolate-brown
8:51and I'm just gonna finesse a little bit
8:53into my crease and make it even deeper
8:55and our call and we're gonna go back in
9:00to saddlewood
9:04now i'm going to smoke out the last line
9:06with bossy and then a little bit of
9:08flamingos and let's try to mix and see
9:10what we can come up with a fine I'm just
9:19gonna try this pink shade called
9:22flamingo and let's see if she wants to
9:24work now I'm just going to put this in
9:26my chair duct and blend in I know it's a
9:28little weird placement but hey I'm a
9:30fucking weirdo
9:32alright guys i am now taking a bossy and
9:38flamingo and yet i'm mixing them
9:40together and I'm creating a little kind
9:42of like smoky grungy dirty like fucked
9:46up kinda I I mean you know only the best
9:49kind and I'm just blending these
9:51together and really bringing it down so
9:53the drama is a real to you all right i
9:56definitely think I need a little bit of
9:58black and my waterline so I'm gonna take
9:59my trusty max moulder eye pencil and
10:02let's get in there
10:11alright my eyes are there looking for
10:15mold
10:15oh alright i think the only thing that
10:18this I look needs now is on some lashes

10:23in with my benefit roller lash mascara

11:06my personal and go to nude from my own
11:08brand and oh i think i could just die
11:11this one I mean this let though i think

11:28added the loss i really don't think it
11:30needs this so i want to go in with this
11:33new girl on gold little like I mean

0:32you better do that so of course here we are now
0:35today I'm gonna be showing you how to get this kind of like Barbie doll asked
0:39little cut crease full glam a moment with bitchy winged liner and a really
0:45bright lip and of course highlight highlight highlighted everywhere
0:51so if you want to see how I did the full foundation and the doing is click the
0:55video before this one
0:57and if you want to see how I completed the look then keep on watching
1:01alright so before we get started on the full makeup
1:05Oh Betty the brows first
1:22browser on now let's get started with this look to get this smoky cut crease
1:27little type of Barbie moment that we are trying to achieve today i am going to be
1:32using my Kat Von D shade + light eye palette now we're basically going to use
1:36all shadows from his palate today
1:39I love this it's perfect as every new trade you could possibly want for a
1:42quick little easy look nothing is quick and easy about this look but you know
1:47the drill so we are going to take a little flat blending brush my trusty mac
1:52to 52 as usual and we're going to be dipping into this white color right here
1:57these are really pigmented so you don't need to use a lot and I am just going to
2:02Pat this under my in tire brow bone
2:08and we're going to let that sit for a minute we're almost going to be baking
2:12under the brows
2:13if you will now if you notice how i'm doing his little patting motions and
2:17basically pressing the powder into my skin that is going to be like the best
2:22way to get that brow highlight to never come off during the entire day we got
2:27that Urban Decay eyeshadow primer in shade and nygma
2:31and this is the quantity it's like a neutral nude Matt type of base
2:35so I'm just going to whip it out and apply now I like this because it's a
2:39really neutral look so my lids have any darkness or redness gets canceled that
2:45which is nice going to use the same brush and dab that primer all over the
2:51lid there we go
2:52cool so now the lids are primed and i'm going to go back in with that white
2:59shade again and put this on top of the primer so it's like really going to
3:03stand out
3:04oh yes now a key essential part of this look is giving your lids a lot of space
3:09so I'm going to take this and already I'm going to drag it all the way down
3:13let me turn my face a little and we're going to bring this all the way in there
3:17right there and that is going to be blank
3:21during this entire look and then we'll drag out the white and will bring it all
3:24the way out
3:25all right now it's time to start creating our wing
3:29all right now let's start carving out that socket now I'm going to mind a
3:32little higher than normal because i want to create a really big dramatic type of
3:37like smoky wing
3:38so I'm gonna be taking this morphy 514 brush
3:41I love this little detailer and we're going to be dipping into this like
3:45reddish just like a warm tone brown as like a red base to it I
3:50love this guy and we're just going to coat our entire bristles with this so
3:55I'm gonna go a little higher than normal and i'm going to sketch out my own lid
4:01which is going to be really delicate so you don't wanna go to heavy hand you
4:06want to be really light with this one and I'm going to bring that all the way
4:09and you want to create a really dramatic effect today so I'll start to soften it
4:15and you can see how I'm bringing it already down here
4:19so you're going to be really careful and then i'm going to start flicking my
4:22wrist and dragging this up a little bit so it gives it the evolution of it are
4:26being blended out
4:27I'm gonna follow and go down a little bit and out almost like a little i'm
4:32going to drag it all the way to my
4:34I brown and that's how we start and build out our socket
4:38now to get the upper part really airbrush I'm just gonna take a blending
4:42brush and I'm going to be using this transition color right here and I'm
4:45going to be mixing it back in with that Brown
4:48so we get a really nice airbrush effect for the Rockets I'm just going to go
4:54over what i did a little bit and just start dragging up so it's really nice
5:00and soft and then you can go on with your blending brush and I love to just
5:04dab right back in that really white one and we're just going to take it under
5:08the eye and we're just gonna drag it out like so so it's really carve and
5:14interaction going to go back and you guys and go
5:16just on the top again so we really soften those lines look has a lot of
5:22back and forth
5:23now it's time for a black winged liner
5:26you guys ready for that I don't even know if I'm ready for that so to get
5:30inspired for this crazy liner
5:33who if you only had like a bag of chips and a red bull today and you've just
5:36been filming and haven't had time to eat
5:37thank God for medical marijuana let's get started
5:43alright so for today's bitchy Conte winged liner i'm going to be using the
5:46YSL babydoll liner in black
5:49now I love the sky because the red sole on the end
5:52oh it is so thin you see that like tiny to accentuate the wing and fill in any
5:58missing little spots that the liquid is not do i'm going to be using the tart
6:02clay pot black liner
6:04this stuff is magic i love this i can wear makeup for 10 hours of my wing is
6:10still the leaky and now i'm going to shut my mouth
6:13hold my breath and get to winning
6:15yeah
6:22all right now that my liner is done I am ready to finish this look
6:27now if your liner does not look like it's ready to apply to be a guillotine
6:31you better go over it some more strange thing all right let's finish this we're
6:36going to go back to this little blending brush and we're just gonna jump right in
6:40there with a little bit of this one and we're just going to go right under the
6:44eyes and be really soft and we're just gonna go back and forth really lightly
6:50and start to create a little smokiness and you have got to take it all the way
6:54in because we are going to add some glitter in a second and then I'm going
6:58to bring it to where the wing starts now the bottom should be really smoked out
7:03now we're going to really accentuate the eyes and do some white doll like liner
7:09in the water line
7:10so if you really want to look plastic and artificial i mean hi that was my
7:14goal since birth
7:15you are just going to get some white liner of your choice and we're just
7:19gonna pop that into the water line and I'm going to really going on
7:23- and even put it right under there and then we're going to drag the liner all
7:28the way across and i'm going back and forth several times
7:32so the color is poppin and then we're going to take the liner and we're just
7:36gonna bring it down a little
7:38hello eyes now if you don't look like an alien sex doll
7:42you got you some more ok so now that the liner is dying
7:46I think I need a little bit of glitter you guys know you don't have to look for
7:50this part actually love how this looks but because it's jeffree star
7:54we're going to do some more glitter now this is a brand I love makes really
7:59don't political the lit cosmetics they specialize in just glitter and the shade
8:03is called champagne wishes
8:05it is so pretty it's like a champagne nude with rainbow glitter it's really do
8:11so i am going to try this glitter glue from to face today
8:17I always use my violet boss but I'm gonna cheat on them today and I'm gonna
8:21try this one
8:22i'm just going to use a phone do me one from morphe this is the g18 and I'm just
8:25going to go home and call it a day
8:28so this is just for the inner corners to give it that little pretty soft look at
8:33some glitter glue on the brush and I'm just going to brush it right where I
8:37want the glitter
8:38no before that dries you want to get your glider and you guys know I love to
8:41just wear this on the cap so I already have some ready to go easy access and
8:47then I'm just going to take the glitter on the brush and just am I put it right
8:52over there
8:53now you want to make sure they both match so I'm just gonna do a little bit
8:57of cleanup and if you get you fall out or sparkle on your face
9:00you can brush it off I would leave it in any extra shine I could ever get
9:04I'm so down for all right so the glitter is drying on there
9:09it will basically be on there until you charmer tomorrow
9:12so now that the glitter is done let's get some lashes on for mascara today

10:01cut and measuring you care so i will be right back
10:06alright guys i am really excited because today i am using a new lash glue
10:13I'm really excited
10:17why because y'all know my issue with lash glue so I am trying
10:22that s quito mosquito mosquito lash glue
10:26now I saw a lot of good reviews on this one
10:29it's latex-free it does not smell like let's give it a smell
10:35it's just very like really neutral like don't really think much about it it's
10:40not bad at all and high the packaging is a really cute way easier than that
10:44squeeze tube and
10:46let's get our lash and let's get to gluing now because my corners tend to
10:49come up i'm going to add a little bit extra over there
10:53now i'm going to give this a minute to get tacky like 30 seconds give a little
10:59wave speed up the process
11:01all right now what I'm going to see if his blue down
11:07just doing a little walk through double check lashes are fully on a skiddo lash
11:14glue

11:18I love these lashes they just make me feel so like a dainty and pretty makes
11:22you want to like look all your brother's friends in high school and just have a
11:25world
11:26all right now let's get down to the last final step
11:30the lips i'm going to be doing a little Barbie inspired hombre i'm going to be
11:34using the new on estas to have liquid lip and shade or Rio and my own of the
11:39lower liquid lipstick and shape Queen supreme
11:42so let's get to it it's gonna put the hotter pink shade on that outside of my
11:47lid and then we're going to put the baby pink in the center
11:56all right now we're just gonna put Queen supreme in the center
11:59i'm actually going to use a little I shadow brush to help ombre and blend
12:03that out and an easy little solution is to use your middle finger and just kind
12:11of blend in any harsh lines and then for a little more definition i like to go in
12:16with that hot pink color one more time on that brush just get a little bit of
12:20product and then you can kind of adding a little bit more darkness
12:24all right the lips are dry now i know i said lips was the last thing and if you

13:59thank you so much for watching I will see you on the next one
0:09hello everyone welcome back to my channel
0:15now when i asked you guys what kind of videos you want to see next
0:18I got an overwhelming amount of response to do a full drugstore makeup tutorial
0:24now I know you shady bitch is that I would never do it but come on if your
0:28makeup artist you can make anything work
0:30not that drugstore makeup is bad it's just have a lot of tendencies to be more
0:35misses than hit from my previous experiences um
0:39and now that I make makeup I know formula so this was a really interesting
0:43experiment and I just want to make a disclaimer that some of the makeup
0:47brushes are from my personal collection from other brands that are not drug
0:52store but every makeup products used in this video is drugstore pot so if you
0:57want to see how i created all this
0:59keep watching and see what happens alright so the first thing I'm going to
1:04do is take this lip smackers dr pepper flavor lip balm and I'm my lips
1:12now your face primer i was looking through all the aisles and I like el
1:16pibe you some of this stuff before i've never used this hydrating face primer
1:21before so we're going to try it out
1:23I'm not really sure how much you're supposed to use i'm just going to use a
1:26nice little bull is very bad fying i will let that dry down for a second it
1:32now you guys know the first thing I always do is put on a lot of foundation
1:37so I Instagram that i was going to be doing this video and you guys gave me so
1:42many options and advice on what to buy and the product that kept standing out
1:49was the lower yell and fallible Pro matte foundation
1:53everyone is like this is amazing everyone's raving about it so I'm going
1:58to go in with shade 102 shell page
2:02let's pray to Jesus and matches I'm just going to take this with a real
2:07techniques blush
2:08this is number three hundred you guys know I love to . it all around my face
2:13before I blend it out
2:15now I've never used any of these products
2:18for so let's see how they work
2:22ok I think that let me start bumping this in now using new foundations can
2:33break you out it doesn't matter if they are high end or not changing your
2:37routine just freaks your skin or in general
2:40so I need you guys to all pause this video and say a silent prayer for my
2:44face and as always we're going to blend to the neck avoiding all the tattoo
2:51foods and you guys know I have to dab that year think that's good enough
2:56coverage for me we'll see what happens
2:58before i do a lot of powder i'm definitely going to conceal
3:02now if you watched my previous videos you guys know I'm really not a fan of
3:05concealer but this foundation is just not as heavy as I normally would wear it
3:11I'm definitely going to conceal and I got this Maybelline better skin
3:17camouflage concealer
3:19let's try this out this is shade ivory
3:24alright this bunch is damp let's start blending out this sponge is really hard
3:34like it's actually taking off my foundation
3:41so you see that my foundation is like missing right there
3:46ok we're not going to use that let's go back to the brush i'm just going to use
3:52the same foundation brush and try to pump out some of this concealer before
3:57it's too late
3:59ok much better I'm like Jesus
4:02now the cool thing about this concealer is it's not making any fine lines like
4:08more noticeable it's actually concealing and doing an amazing job
4:13come thru concealer now sometimes i do cream contour sometimes they don't we're
4:19going we're going to just do patters today
4:21now I want a full mass of coverage so I thought
4:25loreal infallible Pro matte powder foundation and i'm going to dust this
4:30over my entire face
4:33come through Matt I'm Matt powder
4:41now that doesn't have much color to it which is what I wanted but it does leave
4:45a really nice matte finish and this shade was 104 Celyn you know I have a
4:51fair pitch now the really wasn't a lot of highlight and contour kit at the
4:58drugstore
4:59I did find this really joke when from Maybelline it's called the master
5:02contour palette just three shades it's contour blush highlight I think that
5:06contour color is perfect for my skin tone so we're going to try that today
5:10and I also found this big bronzing powder it's from prestige cosmetics
5:15so i am going to onto our first i'm going to be using this miss cosmetics
5:19brush my fav you contour brush I'm going to dip into the contour and was painted
5:25ok ok let's try it out
5:30now we're gonna go down here and we're going to carve our face out of stone
5:36now for the forehead i'm going to be going in with this estee lauder bronzing
5:39brush and we're going to dip into that prestige cosmetics
5:43let's see how going to do
5:46oh my god this has shimmer to it mother fucker
5:51ok so my dumbass didn't realize that that goal being up there as a shimmer
5:56let's wipe off the gold bronzing Stardust powder off my forehead
6:01ok I think we're getting there i might have a small halo but uh it's ok it's
6:07preparing me to go to have it now to soften that we're just going to use the
6:11same brush and get back into that powder
6:15ok we're we're pretty going toward I'm feeling it
6:18all right now contouring the nose a little scary so I'm gonna be using the
6:22Oval three brush from artiste how I dip in this once
6:25you don't need a ton of product unless you want that
6:29all right and i'm going to cap the end of it now for a highlight
6:34there is a highlight in here which I'm going to watch it with my finger
6:38they had no idea if it's gonna work or not pretty now i'm just going to grab a
6:42more p310 fan brush
6:46I love this thing have someone there and let's see if I'm going to be going
6:52it's subtle it's cute
6:56I'm noticing that this actually has a little bit of color with it to add some
7:01little shimmer about the Browns i'm about to draw on
7:04ok actually pretty cute more layering the more shine i'm seeing on my
7:09cheekbones
7:10all right for brows today I tried to find something comparable to the honest
7:14Ostia shade toe and i found two things this Maybelline brow defined and Phil
7:20duo
7:21I think will match of course it's hard to tell when you look at a unit carton
7:25and you can't swatch it so i got this and then also l'oreal has a ground
7:29stylist which had a brow powder in it
7:32how powder was hard to find at the drugstore so maybe using this guy
7:35obviously I don't need this wax because i have no grau hairs so we're just gonna
7:39dip it is powder and try to draw on with this
7:47ok now that I got the shape down i'm going to go in with this mac eyebrow
7:53angled brush and dip into this lowering l
8:01all right I decided on a topi gold glitter soft neutral eye and i am going
8:10to be using the lower la palette nude one of the lightest shade is probably my
8:16color right there so I'm gonna be using this and I'm gonna use my go-to Mac 252
8:23brush and just apply this over the entire eye area definitely messy a lot
8:30of fallout
8:31you guys know I did you fall out now this position formula
8:36these are all like shimmer shades and this top one is like it's really pretty
8:40as like a glitter to it
8:42so I'm going to dip into this guy right here and I'm just going to put this
8:47right under the brow bone
8:51oh let's go in with this L contour brush now I'm assuming this is for the eyes
9:00not the cheeks and i'm going to go to this wet and wild palette this is that
9:04I'm getting sunburned eyeshadow palette and I'm gonna hit this crease color
9:11ok I'm just going to put this in my crease it was dark and i'm going to
9:18leave some space below and put gold where there is no color yet so bear with
9:23me
9:26ok now i'm gonna pop this out and i'm actually gonna do this
9:33taupe shade right here and go over that and stop in the line with my Makka 224
9:39brush and drag the shadow down a little bit
9:49take this brush again and go back in with the light color and right below the
9:54shimmers going to blend this out a little bit
9:56there we go now i'm going to go in with this one second Toby shimmery color and
10:05add in a little bit more dimension to my lid
10:09before i do anything with the under i'm going to add some shimmer and i found
10:13this press glitter pigment from wet n wild gonna use my finger I know that
10:19sounds very strange coming from me but sometimes the fingers are the best
10:27good morning goal thank you for joining my lid really pretty
10:31now that sounds like a sticky consistency to it which is making it
10:34stick to my lid really good
10:37all right now I'm going to take a more p 5 11 brush and really get in the inner
10:43corner which I could not do with my fingers and then i'm going to go back
10:47over with this and really press it
10:51yes now i'm going to take some of this and just put it in my inner corner below
10:56now for under the eye
10:59I'm going to take this myth cosmetics - 20 brush and I'm just gonna take this
11:06color here just love it on dirt now I wanted to try some sort of eyeliner so I
11:20got this
11:21revlon eye pencil and i'm going to put it in my waterline and see what happens
11:27all right now with the morphe 514 brush I'm going to go back in with that same
11:36brown shade that we just did under the eye and I'm just going to bump it out
11:40starting the center of my eye and go outwards and smoke it out a little bit
11:45more
11:48all right now i'm going to go back in with this shade a little bit on the
11:54outside and blend it with my Mac blending brush and kind of merge these
12:00two together now to me these eyeshadows blend a little patchy
12:06it's old it's kind of frustrating having to go back and forth so many times which
12:11is not normal for me but i think i got the eyes where I want them
12:16I was talking to my grandma about doing this video and she goes if you don't use
12:19the famous pink Maybelline mascara I'm going to slap you upside your head
12:24if you've never heard of this mascara you must be under an igloo in Antarctica
12:29because this has been around before any of us were born right for lashes i know
12:37this is a drugstore makeup tutorial but i got these at the costume store and
12:42they were 89 cents so I definitely think this will qualify
12:46now these are really big and dramatic not that you're shocked at all
12:49it's gonna float away too quick of Jesus
12:56now i'm going with the tweezers and I'm trusting my real lashes with the false
13:00ones
13:01all right second latches on last but not least is the lips
13:05now that was a hard one for me I just want something really bright
13:09coralie and fun so I found
13:11this Revlon brand it is a liquid to matte but it's not long-lasting like
13:17mine
13:18so this shade is called temptation forces
13:23Wow look like a cake candle
13:27now it's still wet looking looks like a lip gloss but it says it is ultra HD
13:37matte lip color
13:39so let's give this a second and see if it is going to dry down
13:44all right so it's been about five minutes off camera and this still hasn't
13:48dried down
13:49I don't know if it's supposed to drive all the way matt it says Matt and Matt
13:53Matt as you can see it looks like a lip gloss to me it's like slowly getting
13:57there but it's still really shiny
13:59I love the lip color I don't mind a gloss it's just not doing what it says
14:03so now last but not least I was like oh my God if I can't use my Urban Decay all
14:09nighter what the fuck am I gonna do
14:12and i found this Maybelline it's basically like a fixed plus but it's
14:16called master fix
14:18so let's see what happened ok let that settle
14:25alright guys that was that full drug store
14:28look as you can see some of the products were really amazing i kind of want to
14:32scrape office gold glitter and register as the video progressed the foundation
14:38did not sit on my skin
14:40how I wanted to I maybe it was the primer maybe I don't know no one knows
14:44but um I love the look I think it's really fun it was a little challenging
14:48for me in the sense that i have never used these products before not that I
14:52was afraid she's drugstore makeup but I just prefer higher-end products because
14:57the formulas tend to be top notch where some of the stuff i was really hard to
15:02do so i hope you enjoy watching this and i'll see you next time bye guys
0:00what's up guys welcome to my Channel today we're going to be doing a really
0:11dark dramatic sultry look with metallic glow and sneak peek at a new product so
0:17have fun watching this and get ready for something special
0:23all right for brows today we're going to go back to the old-skool jeffree star
0:26pink brown and i'm going to use a few products that have never used for the
0:30crowd before now i love on estancia's dipbrow so when I saw this green color
0:35in barbie pink I was like who's gonna be a good brown color
0:38now I love to draw them on the pencil first to try to get the shape down so
0:42i'm going to be using this

1:26pellet and the Kat Von D shade + light eye palette
1:30now these are very versatile and I mean we're going to be using this guy today
1:35this like burnt orange sienna color the black one and then this one we're going
1:40to be using the lightest shade on here and will dip into some of the Browns to
1:47get a really nice chocolate I going here
1:49so first step that I always always do is I take my mac 242 brush and I'm going to
1:56take the lightest shade here and I'm just gonna start
2:00non under the brow I'm gonna take this shade and pull it all grow into my
2:09tattoo

2:37mac 217 brush now I love the black shadows there so pigment said I'm just
2:43going to take this and start but bring it on

3:12time to do the under eyes are under my eyes we're going to darken them really
3:21black

3:26and we're just going to lightly pull this down and put some liner in the
3:31water line i'm going to drag this liner a little below the lash line so i can
3:37smoke it out and use it as my second blending tool
3:42now this is not have to be perfect because we're gonna probably put more
3:47liner later after we put the shadow down there and blend it out

0:42watch because we're on YouTube where there is a billion makeup artist so I
0:47will keep smoking dope
0:48I'm gonna keep using gucci makeup and I know people be myself
0:52all right now back to make up today I'm doing a little fun
0:55warm tone sunset it's not smoky it's not a wing it's like an in-between smoky
1:00wing so saddle up
1:02get your brush is ready and enjoy this look today I did my normal face routine
1:07if you want to see how I did the base of the brows you can look through my
1:10channel and find that gym but today we're going to do a cat eye
1:15I'm gonna start by priming my lids oh my god Geoffrey finding the lid I know it
1:20happens once in a while especially for these extreme glamour looks and I'm
1:24gonna go in with the YSL couture
1:27I primer i love this one if you want to use the Mac painterly that everyone else
1:31uses please use that i personally can't buy mine
1:36so we will be using this today and i'm just applying this with a little mac 217
1:40brush and I'm just going to coat my entire lids and I'm gonna bring it up
1:46almost to the brow bone drive and have a brow bone if you don't have a brownie i
1:50guess if you my whole forehead is the brow bone
1:53it's almost like matched my skin tone that's crazy and then I'm going to put
1:56some under my eyes
1:57- just a little bit just a little hair all right now today we're going to do
2:02something that I normally don't do
2:05we're going to use the scotch tape for that wing
2:08when you do a lot of eyeshadows anyone to get that extreme cut look
2:12scotch tape is the easiest way to go now a lot of you're going to like what i
2:17mean about that over your foundation
2:19I definitely a.m. I'm just going to put on a really light and soft so it doesn't
2:24really disrupt it and if it rips it off will just apply more later
2:27so what you want to do is just for your tear ducts are you want to follow your
2:30natural eye line and just go up so I'm just gonna follow that natural line and
2:38being on
2:40she scotch probably the most common question is well how do you get this
2:44side to match its honestly like drawing on the Browse you just got to eyeball it
2:48all right now that the eyes are taped it's time to do the eye shadow
2:52now i'm going to use a new palette today that I've never tried this is the new
2:55violet
2:56Baz Holy Grail I shadow palette
2:59now when I saw these colors i was like who
3:03bitch this paula is sickening I am loving these read that goal off
3:11I think right away i am going to dip into this color called hashed ad and i'm
3:17going to be using my Mac 224 brush is going to be like my transition color and
3:22let's see how well the shadows blend
3:25I'm just gonna go right in my crease I'm actually not going to go all the way you
3:30guys know I love to go all the way to my brow bone into the nose
3:34today we're going to stop that because I we're doing something do for it
3:40sorry dick in my throat and i'm just going to follow my natural brow bone
3:45all right now I'm going to take the brush and go all the way to where that
3:50tape is and then brush out now
3:53course foremost to be they do not have a face tattoo you you can drag it out even
3:57more if you want
3:58I'm just going to go past the brow for like a really dramatic effect
4:04all right now normally i do a really light eyeshadow at the top which i'm
4:11going to just do now and i'm going to take the shade called thanks a latte
4:16which is a really nice cream nude color without shimmer
4:21and i'm just going to take my mac to buy to brush and just take it from the start
4:26of the brow and buff it all the way across this is really going to help me
4:31get that amazing soft finish and make sure it's all blended and then I'm just
4:36going back with that brush with no extra product from the softening that
4:41transition color even more now let's add in some darkness
4:47all right i'm gonna take this mac 217 brush and I'm going to dip into that
4:50wine color
4:52oh so pretty high i'm going to create some really dramatic depth so let me
4:58just take this brush and I'm going to actually put it on my lid but not all
5:04the way just a little bit
5:06well halfway there notice how I'm not going all the way in
5:10I'm just keeping it what what is this like a sixty percent and then we're
5:14going to drag this as well and the throw that tape really comes in handy because
5:18it's going to stop all that crazy fall out and it's going to create a beautiful
5:22line now how we're going to make this color blend amazing we're going to go
5:26back in with that same blending brush from earlier
5:30I like to go back and forth and back and forth a lot so we're going to get tipped
5:34back into hash tag and then we're just going to blend and blend before I add in
5:38any more darkness
5:40I want to do a pop of color in here and I keep staring at this color called
5:45toffee it's like this gold color I'm like mesmerized by it so let me dip in
5:50with my little mac - 13 brush
5:52let's see here who what she's a she's pigmented all right so let me just do a
5:57little bit in case it's really intense and we'll just pop this right in here
6:02come thru gold and i'm going to just take this down right in the corner
6:10ok this gold I'm like I can't stop staring at it
6:15so ready we got the gold going to the cranberry into the transition
6:19I definitely want to do a little bit
6:22of a kind of Darkness not necessarily liner but I want that crazy liner fact
6:27so I'm gonna be dipping into teddy bear yes and we're using the more feet
6:33I 14 crash i'm just going to take this and go really low
6:38almost yeah well my lash line is and kind of go a little tiny bit in the
6:43crease with that dark color just so i have some like real depth to this look
6:48so I'm not taking it in there it's just really subtle settle settle settle
6:53there's nothing subtle about this look but I this is a subtle part
6:57let me feel this tape off and see what's under this mess my whole skin like pills
7:03off who lowered guide me through this misery Bay on
7:08mmm now is the side going to be even though oh my god of here
7:13BAM she is kunchi ok now that the tape is off
7:18I see everybody always taking black liquid or a black liner and doing it
7:22across the lid and up I want to be different and not do that because this
7:27the shadows are so pretty it's like a beautiful like sunset I'm like zoo on
7:32the shadows together are perfect so let's just focus on the bottom
7:37now i'm just going to take my black mac smolder eye pencil and we're just going
7:42to tightline that water line really thinly
7:46all right now for under the eyes i'm going to take this color called so jelly
7:53it's like how do you explain this color it's so pretty like a peachy soft
7:58coralie I don't know what it's like I don't have to explain it it's just first
8:02so I'm taking my Tom Ford 14 pencil brush and I'm just gonna pop some of
8:08this down below that liner
8:11oh yes when your upper shadow is so intense you don't really need to like do
8:18crazy crazy under here
8:19we're just going to have the lens
8:21this into the gold ok now I brought this almost like the middle of my iris
8:27so now i'm going to be taking this color called cranberry splash right here with
8:32the same brush and I'm just going to dip into their really lightly now I'm going
8:36to take that and drag it under and normally you guys know I love to drag my
8:41liner on the bottom out we're actually going to keep it tight today
8:45and notice how that black liner on top I've sort of mixed it now that we've
8:49gotten towards the end of the eyeball and I'm taking the black and I'm just
8:53kind of dragging it down almost like little downward motions so it creates a
8:58really nice smoky effect
9:00I want to keep that darkness towards the end of my eye and now i'm just going
9:04back and forth and back and forth
9:06if an eyeshadow is extreme with the pigment and you want to just test it out
9:10I'll dab it into the pan and then I'll really lightly go over until I really
9:15know densified it can get
9:17then I'll go over it more harder meaning my pressure
9:21so the first time I was barely dragging it across now I'm like really pushing it
9:26into my eyes so I can get that cranberry effect
9:28this is Jorge's now usually smoke it out really happy and bring it down i'm going
9:33to keep it a little more light today and i'm going to be dipping and to that so
9:38jelly color one more time with a little small morphe brush and I'm just going to
9:43go over it one more time
9:46there we go we're just going to merge these two together so they're like
9:49becoming best friends again and then I'm gonna dip in a cranberry splash one more
9:53time with the same brush and then just kind of blend them together
9:58all right i am obsessed with this I look but it wouldn't be complete without some
10:03amazing lashes so let's put them on and I'm going to curl my lashes with the Too
10:08Faced better than sex mascara before I put on them lashes bottom master is so
10:18essential for this look like bring it all together
10:22for lashes today i'm gonna be using the violet boss faux mink style lashes these
10:27are brand new and the style is called justice land i love these because they
10:31don't like
10:32however your eyeshadow and go like all the way up to your brow which I like
10:35doing that every day but I want my eyeshadow to have the center stage so
10:39let's put these muthafuckas on
10:46you know what's cool about these lashes is that when I put the band on my eyelid

4:13right after that little darker
4:15we're just gonna tuck that in our crease I'm not gonna drag my black all the way
4:21down like I normally do you want to stop it and just kind of drag it away and

5:03morphe there's no number I've had this for like a really long time so surrender
5:08the number but I know they must still have this and why pigment I'm just going
5:13to highlight under my brow a little bit
5:17hello my browser like
5:21thank you Jesus you always forget us it's a different look and there you guys
5:25are probably what you're like really going on with the highlight and there's
5:28something really soft and delicate because they have to draw my eyebrows

5:37so you regular folks have it easy now I'm going to take the same brush same
5:43luscious color and i'm just going to pop it in my inner corner right now
5:47well because i just want to see how it's going to look shimmery and i'm also
5:52going to put it a little under my eye here
5:56all right now before we do the under eye and let's put on 15 layers of glitter
6:01i'm gonna be using this violence boss amazing as it is just amazing this is
6:06called copper Ella
6:08it is perfect for this look and they actually have glitter like adhesive
6:13already it's called their secret weapon glitter adhesive so let's use that I am
6:18too faced has glitter glue as well but this one is like quick and easy like my
6:25all Max's fuck boys and we're just going to coach this whole made and we're going
6:32to go under that darkness that I created earlier and everything that i'm coding
6:36will have glitter on it now if you don't want glitter just skip this part
6:41if you're watching my channel and you don't want glitter and no one's okay so
6:49oh my glitter is poured it all over my crotch so I just like to take them out
6:53and put it on the cap and i think i'm going to take a little brush
6:56this is like an old Mac brush i have and we're just gonna
6:59ah we're going to come because gosh
7:03jarred that she was good
7:04let it and we're just going to coat everywhere that glue was and i'm going
7:08to be really delicate i hate when glitter gets everywhere so you just
7:11gotta pass this on
7:13now there's going to be a little fall out some sparkles on my face we'll deal
7:17with that later for now I just want to make sure my eyelids look like copper
7:21the last oh this letter is the glitter is basically done for now if you want
7:30you can put glitter and down here i'm going to leave it kind of like more
7:34fresh uplifting i noticed a lot of the times that always do dark under my eyes
7:38look at me glitter everywhere
7:39hi middle of rubbing all over me sometimes it's just like one of those
7:43things I'm like huh
7:45don't go to waste hike later oh my god it's all over my labia minora
7:50alright so for under the eyes what are we gonna do
7:54i think i'm gonna do there's so many options
7:57I'm going to do black liner not that any of your shock but i'm not going to
8:01smudge it out
8:01really crazy this is smouldered from Mac you know that's my favorite
8:06and we're just going to do it really tight on the water lines so we're not
8:09going to drag it down and do a really dramatic like I normally do
8:12it's just literally going to be that that's it all right so we got the liner
8:16on in there
8:16now we are going to smoke it out a little bit i'm going to keep with that
8:20round family at the bottom and just use these two again and then we're going to
8:24go in with Just Peachy it's like this amazing
8:26peachy coral i mean it's it's a peach coral color and I'm going to blend that
8:30in my inner corners and then we're going to smoke it out a little more
8:34so let's use this more fee for 33 brush and dip into that peach color
8:40I'm just going to put it over luscious so it's almost like I'm layering
8:44oh wow pretty I was going to layer this a few times now being really delicate
8:49and I'm just kind of pressing it into my skin I'm not going back and forth all
8:53crazy now i'm going to go in with this top four pencil brush and I'm just going
8:57to play around with that puree and so yummy
9:00one more time and then there's one of the top here called charmed I'm sure
9:04I'm going to dip into that one as well I'm going to pray and summer yum and the
9:08same time so many different here and then different here so it kind of makes
9:11its own color and then I'm just going to go under that I and just kind of stuff
9:17out
9:18I'm only doing you know half my lids like from the iris out blend
9:24then I'm going to take this morphy 514 brush and I'm just going to dip into
9:29that
9:30charmed I'm sure it's like a topi darker brown and we're just going to lightly
9:35buff that under bring it out just create a little more depth to that under I then
9:42that blending brush we used earlier same thing i'm going to go in with that same
9:46charm color and we're just gonna pop it and blend it out
9:49out all right now before we do lashes and mascara i'm going to take this color
9:54called nectar it's like a gold in let her know it's golden yumminess
9:58and I'm going to dip into that with that same morphe brush and I'm gonna do it at
10:02the inner inner corner
10:04so it's like that extra little pop if I turn to the side you can definitely see
10:09that this is a two-faced palette tutorial it only makes sense that I used
10:14that better than sex to face mascara i love this one I know they have a new
10:18waterproof one that I have not tried yet it comes in the mail in a few days so if
10:23you've tried the waterproof one
10:24tell me maybe in the comments what you guys think of it because i cannot wait
10:28to try it this is like one of my favorite mascara is not the only issue I
10:32have with it is what I do my bottom lashes if i look down for a period of
10:36time
10:37it kind of creates those black dots so when I heard that the waterproof version
10:41was coming I likes grange so hopefully that will alleviate that issue because
10:47who was that
10:49alright so after I do this bottom mascara i'm going to show you guys a
10:52little trick that I like to do first we're gonna hold our breath because this
10:55brush is so big sometimes if i'm not paying attention i hit the bristles on
11:00my eye
11:00and then you guys know it's all downhill from there so take a deep breath make
11:04the weirdest face that you can and go for it
11:09alright so if you ever look down and get those black mascara . that i was talking
11:13about earlier
11:14a lot of the times i find it really easy to take a like dr beauty blender and any
11:20like setting powder that's translucent so like this cat cosmetics one is great
11:24I just dab a little bit of it on the end and then i'll take it and all go where
11:29the lashes are and I'll just kind of dust translucent powder on the ends so I
11:34do not get those mascara marks and for the most part it usually works unless
11:39you live in like Florida or Africa or the humidity is really insane
11:44this should definitely work for you now for lashes going to go and JD's are
11:48really pretty these are the faux mink ones from sephora you guys have seen us
11:52do this a million times think these are cute they're subtle ish settle for me
11:56but I think they're gonna still let that glitter show and have at the moment so
12:00let me
12:01precut these and measure my eye off camera and i will be right back
12:05all right so I just trim these i'm going to put my glue on high glue if you guys
12:11know any lash glue that is non latex and doesn't smell like old people to China
12:20of bingo game
12:21please leave some comments below I need an amazing latch company that the google
12:27actually like hold my inner corners because they always have the issue where
12:3010 minutes later the corners up and I'm like I'm gonna kill / so please help

12:40little of my lid and then I'll take tweezers and just kind of mold them

3:13I will be right back today I'm going to be using the morphe 35o palette if
3:19you've never heard of this
3:20you must have been sleeping under a rock if you have never used more feet shadows
3:24they are really pigmented at a really amazing price
3:28I also sell my liquid lips on working brushes com not just sound like an
3:33advertisement but they are branded actually believe in love the brushes and
3:37I now self to their website so check it out
3:40first of all I'm going to be dipping into these light colors so I'm gonna be
3:43taking my mac 25 to brush my go-to and we're just gonna you know take this
3:48color and put it right below the brow
3:51i am going to add some shimmer in a little bit
3:55this is going to act as like my primer I don't really use eyeshadow primer is a
3:59lot so I love to put down a shadow and I like to drag this past the prowl for the
4:07transition color I'm going to be dipping into this orange one
4:10I love the shade and it is really pigmented this is that Gucci blending
4:16brush number 20 and I'm just gonna place that bright in my crease and blend out
4:24and I'm going to take that and bring it into the brow bone and we're just going
4:28to take the brush and start popping up to give it that really nice blended
4:32outlook
4:33I want this to look seamless and airbrush like my vagina
4:39getting there I do like to bring it into my contour on the nose
4:43it has that dramatic look all right now I'm going to take this amazing copper
4:47shade right here and I'm going to be chipping in with the little bobby brown
4:52eyeshadow brush just start placing this on the lid
4:56now what I love to do is take the mac fix+ this is the coconut flavor and
5:01spray the brush a little bit for that full metallic moment and then once you
5:07go on the lid
5:09haha hi there we go so I'm just going to take this and start buffing it on the
5:13entire lid
5:15all right now I definitely need to add some depth and dimension into my crease
5:19so I'm just going to be going in with this guy and see how that looks at first
5:24now the shadows are very pigmented so you definitely want to knock out your
5:28fall out
5:29BAM this is a matte shadow so I'm just gonna tuck this in my crease right above
5:34that copper shimmer just my lids really dark and dramatic
5:39all right now we're basically merging the two shadows with this together and
5:44we're just going to take it down here here
5:47I don't really want it on my lid so I'm just gonna be really gentle and then you
5:51can take your blending brush and go back in with that orange color and just kind
5:57of go over that darkness again so it blends out nicely
6:01now i'm going to start on my under eyes now for the inner rim month i'm going to
6:06be using the anastacio pro pencil
6:09I love this it's not start white like I normally do it's more than nude color
6:13and i'm just going to take my Beauty Blender as always to get into that water
6:17line
6:18so my elasticity of my eyes does not fall apart it settle it's not too crazy
6:23but it definitely opens and lifts the eye
6:26ok now that the water line is done i'm going to softly add some shading under
6:31it going to take this mac 239 brush and I'm going to dip lightly into that
6:38transition color that we used earlier which is this guy and I want to actually
6:42mix it with this other bronzy color so it's creating its own color on a lightly
6:48just go under where it just to the liner
6:52now you can actually skip this part and just do mascara if you're not feeling as
6:56dramatic but if you don't like drama
6:58why the fuck are we even watching this together it's going to take it and go
7:02all the way always going to go all the way we're going to basically connect
7:07this inner part with the below
7:10there we go and I'm just laughing about being really soft motions
7:15now with the same brush I'm going to take a darker color dip into this guy
7:19right here and I'm just going to lightly buff it under my eyes in between that
7:26light and what I just laid down so it's almost like a second liner
7:31I'm just going to do it really like the middle now i'm going to take my blending
7:34brush from earlier and without any new product on it i'm just going to blend it
7:39out a little softer now i'm going to highlight the eyes and i'm going to take
7:45the same back to buy to brush and I'm actually going to dip into this metallic
7:49shimmer up here
7:51hello metallic now I'm just going to take it under my brow bone and just
7:56about fit on a little bit just have a little bit more depth and shine and glow
8:01now because the lids are really dark
8:07I want to brighten them up a little bit add some more dimension you guys know
8:11I'm obsessed with shimmer and glitter
8:14so I'm going to add this Sheila magnificent metals these are really
8:18metallic and you can use it with your finger
8:21this one is called metallic peach and
8:23I'm just going to apply this on the lid and i just love that soft metallic love
8:29em
8:30how can we make such weird faces over to heating near the I like what I'm doing
8:33mascara I'm like before I apply my false lashes
8:38y'all know I can't do it without mascara so today I'm going to be using the ultra
8:44nor black black mascara from chanel i love chanel makeup
8:50they are amazing that and i'm just going to coat my entire top and bottom lashes
8:57with this
8:59I love this mascara separates the bottom lash and very
9:08all right now I'm going to take my trusty duo lash glue as the glue is
9:15getting tachy I like to really thank the band so it will form to your eyelid
9:20better
9:21you never wanted to just be straight out comes out of that box you want that
9:26slight curve
9:27now I always apply these with tweezers it's a lot easier for me of course if
9:32you don't like tweezers you do you and I like to just place them in the center of
9:37my lid and while the glue is still tacky and drawing down you want to move them
9:44around to the desire to the location and if the corners are ever giving you
9:48trouble
9:49this hold them down and press in all right now that the latches are on
9:54i am looking at my I look and I think I want a little bit more shimmer in my
9:59inner corner
10:00I'm just going to take the same stealing stuff with a brush already use for under
10:03my eye and I'm just going to lightly padded and tiny little inner corner
10:09moment yeah nothing too crazy

0:26thought
0:27listen um it's time today's like i'm going to give you some dramatic winged
0:32liner I was looking through my videos and I'm like damn I haven't done a link
0:35in a minute so here's a way i will be doing plenty of them for you guys so if
0:39you want to know how to create this look keep on watching
0:42all right let's get started today i'm going to be using a new kat von d beauty
0:46product this is the locket color correcting eyeshadow primer
0:51I got the lightest shade for me now these are supposed to primary lid and
0:56also color correct in case you have any dark circles
1:00so I'm just gonna take a little bit of this and it's now I'm just going to take
1:07a little brush with no product and just drag that around so we make sure it's
1:12evenly all right now the star of today's look is Pam the many mua makeup geek
1:22collaboration palette
1:24I am obsessive about hi when I first saw it
1:28the red one Mars immediately was like oh my god
1:32red eyeshadow i'm going to start off this look by using some of the light
1:37shades for blending purposes for my transition color to start
1:42i'm gonna be using the soul Mac 224 brush is my favorite you guys know and
1:47i'm going to be dipping into rat pee and Sora and we're just going to mix these
1:51two together and I'm just going to put this right in my socket and blend blend
1:58blend
1:59now we are going to do a really dramatic wing today so i'm going to do really
2:04dramatic eye shadow I mean it goes hand in hand right before i get ready for
2:09these lashes
2:10I've been in Hawaii for a week I were fake lashes every day so my real lashes
2:14are pretty janky right now I think I totally need to take a break on wearing
2:19makeup
2:19but that's like removing my arms and legs so hopefully my lashes will get
2:24over it and not hate me too much
2:26now the cool thing about these shadows as they are really pigmented and they
2:29blend quick so you don't have to spend a lot of time blending it kind of does the
2:33job for you
2:34all right now I'm going to take this mac 217 brush and I'm going to dip right
2:38into Mars now I pigment
2:41this is like a deep red i love Reds every time I see a red I'm just like a
2:46home
2:48I'm gonna take this and remember we are going to do a really drastic Blackwing
2:52so I'm going to take this red I'm just gonna start putting it in the crease and
2:56a little lower on my lid
2:58well so we can really smoke it out and get that rusty dramatic effect
3:04and I'm going to take it and go all the way to the lash line just not all over
3:08here we're just going to stick it to most you know the corners and i'm going
3:11to go back in with that same brush and dip interviewees
3:15just like and soften the line and blend up now
3:22oh my god I felt like Jesus just part of the Red Sea because I'm obsessed with
3:28this look already
3:29ok so now when I saw Luna this metallic foil one right here I was like oh so i
3:35am going to wet brush you can use any synthetic little brush you want and i am
3:41going to dip into that one
3:43oh my god listen here it's not even out my skin yeah and i'm like oh and i'm
3:50going to take this and drag it all the way to the inner corner and half white
3:56hand so it's like really blended now you guys know I like to pack on those
4:00metallic so I could have stopped but you know I have an issue with that
4:04so I'm just going to keep on packing it and I'm gonna also drag it a little bit
4:09down here because you know we are going to do that bottom shadow eventually
4:13someone's going to start now and then of course to blend you want to take Mars
4:17one more time and just kind of Pat and blend in that shimmer
4:20so I just flows nicely together and notice how I'm just connecting and
4:25popping that color right there
4:29course if you want your red back one more time we're going to go in there and
4:32just kind of Pat it in
4:33it should create a little blend in fact what i like to call it
4:37ok now you can save the bottom shadow or later
4:41I like to just do it now before the wing okay before we add any more shadow
4:46let's get to cutting that fear swing all right to get that crazy bitch I'm gonna
4:50kill you winged liner i like to use two products swarms over
4:55I like to use two products and that is the YSL babydoll liner and then to fill
5:01in i'm going to be using my chart black clay liner
5:05I love this stuff this is like water proof that does not move but to begin
5:09let's get the blackout now I love this because you that see that bristle
5:14so then and it just really helps you create your shape so let's start now I
5:20like to start from the middle and just create a shape of what i want and i just
5:28kinda start carving it out
5:31now i do want to follow my lash line and create a natural you know going to get
5:36up angle and that's where my wings going to start
5:38does that look beautiful right now he'll know it looks like shit but it got it
5:42has to start somewhere so as the liner is drying i'm going to take some in just
5:48your drag it up
5:51oh now you definitely have a steady hand so if you drink into new york red bulls
5:55or you're at all hasn't kicked in yet
5:58just you know wait it out we're all because you really got to focus on this
6:02part a lot of back and forth
6:04I get asked all the time what's a quick trip no trick for a wing and I'm like
6:08there really isn't one
6:09I like to really get up close to let me just use this palette has helped some
6:14golden wings take time so do not rush this debt or you're gonna regret it
6:21ok so let's
6:23put that back for a second and now we're going to go in with our liner and you
6:26can use any little liner brush you have this is sonia one from target i love
6:32sharp that is
6:33mmm and I just like to dip in the pot hi I've missed a million times and then
6:38product dries fairly quickly so you just wanna get it on that damn and blend
6:45now why didn't I just use the liquid because this will really make sure it
6:49stays all day I'm days
6:51there we go gradually adding and plotted from dragging up
6:54all right now I'm just gonna clean up the edges
6:57bring it out even more mmm
7:01there we go are right now that the wing is done before we do lashes i am going
7:06to do a little bit of light smoky on the bottom so that all right now for a liner
7:14I wanted to do like a weird
7:17burgundy purpley kinda look now I know some people don't like that they think
7:21it makes them look - like drugged out but the first shadow ever wore was a
7:27rusty red and put it in my waterline and I think everyone thought I was on heroin
7:31or something but i'm having a little flashback friday so i'm going to be
7:34using the rihanna Mac Talk That Talk lip pencil for my eye
7:39hopefully I'll go blind and if i do is the last time you'll ever see
7:44all right so you know what you know what it is we're gonna use a Beauty Blender
7:48and pull the i get in the way this looks cool actually i like I'm feeling this
7:54and beyond easy of course I'm gonna bust out some of that with eyeshadow so we
8:00are definitely not done
8:02all right now I'm going to take a little Tom Ford pencil brush and I'm going to
8:08dip into Mars
8:10BAM and then I want to do a little bit of insomnia
8:16it's like such a pretty like duochrome metal I gotta try it so first we're
8:20going to take a little pencil brush and we're gonna lightly just dragged under
8:25the liner
8:27oh now you can obviously skip doing liner you can do black liner you can do
8:33brown you can do anything you want
8:35so don't feel like you have to do a red with this look I'm just being a little
8:38you know have a little artsy bulb it here but i always do black and my
8:44waterline so I definitely want to change it up today and I'm just gonna budge and
8:48drag and i'm actually going to take that and put it under the wing just the hair

0:20Jeffrey I'm just a sweet country christian gal with the dream and here we
0:25are and i just can't believe that gets a good makeup everyday
0:28ok but for real hi guys i missed you so I've had a really crazy month there has
0:33been so much going on besides traveling a lot
0:37i recently got in that crazy car accident thank God for geico full
0:41coverage because i was able to get the full entire cost of my car
0:45it was a total loss and it was all paid for thank you Jesus so you know i'm not
0:50i just can't believe that I'm even here and I'm even able to you know have a
0:55brand and have a successful business so I'm like you know what I literally you
0:59know not to be morbid but I could have died a few weeks ago so I was like
1:02having a realization like you know what if I can you know by things that I've
1:08always dreamed of buying why am I being apprehensive about it i literally have
1:12one life and it's so short on this earth I was like you know what I'm buying
1:16something I've wanted since I was 12 so after I got my settlement check
1:20I walked into that Lamborghini dealership and i said hi my name is Miss
1:24Starr and I was like one so I can't believe that you guys but I bought a
1:29Lamborghini her con
1:31it is the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen though my hobbies and things that I
1:35love your makeup cars and talk so I just want to say one thing you know it's not
1:39about materialistic items
1:41it's about your goals that you set for yourself and one of my goals was to have
1:45a lambo and have a business
1:47no it's not about the cars and jewelry and all that bullshit because when
1:50you're on your deathbed that shit is not going to matter but it was a moment for
1:54me because I never would have dreamed of having that ever in my driveway
1:59so you know it's crazy but i just want to say that anyone can do it look at me
2:04i am just one guy and makeup that started out with just hopes and dreams
2:09and i did not fit in high school
2:11no one really believed in me and if I can do it
2:14you definitely can so not to sound like a motivational speaker but honestly go
2:18after your dreams
2:19stop living for everyone else i see so many people that just stop what they're
2:23doing because other people are judging them or they think that they're not
2:26going to fit in
2:27stop it do you so besides that I had a little like moment like i got home

2:37that night some crazy bitches decided to all gang up and flag my Instagram brand
2:44account not my personal but they flagged my cosmetics instagram i'm like who has
2:49time for that so basically algorithm if you don't know what that means it's like
2:53the system of Instagram so if a bunch of people are attacking you and saying
2:57you're doing something or flagging you Instagram will deactivate you to review

5:38and highlight I'm using this makeup
5:40forever brush because it just get a big
5:42area really quickly and it just blends
5:45nicely so I'm gonna go a little darker
5:46than usual on the forehead if you're
5:49afraid of that you do not have to do
5:50with this dark but I could play around
5:52sometimes you don't always have to do
5:53your same routine switch it up feeling
5:56wrongs now i'm definitely going to do
6:01the nose quickly now when I mean by that
6:02is I like to take this and I like to
6:04press my hands like this so we make it
6:06even more and then I'm gonna barely
6:08touch the pan
6:11ok now we're just going to go right down
6:14so if you want to contour your nose in a
6:16flash and really quickly just go down
6:19and go to town girl right now we're
6:24going to take a little more fiji three
6:25again and go into that lightest shade i
6:28was going to kind of go over the jaw and
6:30soften her a little bit so it's not so
6:32harsh
6:33I'm just trying to have a moment today
6:34so where is also going to take that
6:36powder again and we're just going to go
6:39over the contour on the forehead with it
6:43just kind of soften it so it's not too
6:44severe gonna go over that knows a bit so
6:47we're not like too crazy because it's
6:48hard to breathe right now we are
6:51contoured now i'm going to quickly do
6:53some eyebrows off camera if you want to
6:54see how i draw them on i will put a link
6:56in the description box down below so
6:59back all right now this I like is
7:01probably one of the most easiest i have
7:03ever done on my channel so we're going
7:04to take a little Mac painterly Paint Pot
7:07and we're just going to coat our entire
7:09lid with that really quickly and just
7:11kinda give our eyes second primer and
7:14now the foundation and concealer that is
7:16on my lids definitely enough but is it
7:18now for eyeshadow get ready for this one
7:21does it is a really simple
7:23I'm gonna pull out my little busy our
7:25palate
7:25I love with this guy it is it's been
7:28through a lot in through some lot of
7:29traveling definitely broke this months
7:32ago thats hanging on a thread right now
7:34people but it's okay because guess what
7:36it still works I'm sure you can see
7:37right here this is one of my favorite
7:39shade it just hit pan the other day and
7:41it is the perfect like ivory bone white
7:44color to put all over your legs and I
7:46like to take this and put it from my
7:47brow bone all the way down and it just
7:50gives you a really lifted look and this
7:52is also going to help that crease color
7:54blend effortlessly alright
7:56the base is laid down alright so this
7:58look is almost done actually no that's
8:00kind of shocking so I'm gonna take a
8:02little blending brush any blending brush
8:04that you want will suffice and I'm gonna
8:06pull out the beauty killer palette now
8:08the shade Courtney girl this is the tea
8:11and the truth so we're just gonna go
8:13into her for a second
8:15now this is where it gets really easy so
8:17the other day when I posted that look I
8:19literally just took this brush and I had
8:20like 20 minutes to get ready before i
8:22went somewhere and I think you know what
8:24I'm just gonna be really really soft and
8:25pretty today and see what happens which
8:27is scary because meet me toning it down
8:29takes a lot of me so I took it and I
8:32literally went all the way and we're
8:35talking just right there so even though
8:38like make sure knows thinner by the way
8:39it's a little trick I've been doing
8:41forever
8:42you just gotta flick up and blend this
8:44crease color into the white shadow that
8:46you just laid down now this is where you
8:48can stop it here you can go out more i
8:51like to take it and even put it on my
8:53lashline and lit a little bit so almost
8:56like hugs it i mean if this is not the
8:58most simple I've ever done girl
9:00get ready and then you're gonna go back
9:02in with that shade of one more time and
9:04you're just gonna put in a little bit
9:06more in to the crease and y la we are
9:11like there you could stop here now I
9:14always say this if you want to add more
9:15you definitely can but if you really
9:18want to stop here
9:20it's ok but i am going to add in just a
9:22little bit of dimension to my lids so
9:24I'm gonna go in with shade vanity
9:26it is a dark like black and plum color
9:30and I'm just going to go into the little
9:32detail brush and I'm just going to
9:34lightly barely put some into my crease
9:37just so my lids have like some extra
9:40drama i'm going to go back in with the
9:41blending brush and just take it and
9:43soften it so there's no extra powder
9:45again on any of the brushes we're just
9:47gonna really just make the lid have a
9:49little oh hi
9:51so it's not so flat all right now to
9:54make your eyes pop a little bit we're
9:55gonna take a little fascinating white
9:57liner from Mac where it's going to take
9:58that beauty blender have it lightly pull
10:00down our water line and then we're gonna
10:02pack in that white liner and turn into

12:08really similar

15:16i'll see on the next one
0:00what's up everyone welcome back to the pink fabulous channel
0:13mrs. jeffree star for today's look I wanted to recreate a look I saw a Jaclyn
0:18hill film recently she did this beautiful halo smokey eye and when I saw
0:23it I was like mesmerized and glued to the screen like it looked perfect on her
0:28and I i was inspired i wanted to do my version of course my face shape is a
0:33little different than hers so I tailored look to fit my bone structure but trying
0:39to stay true to what she did and i love it i think it's really gorgeous
0:42it's an everyday look at anyone could wear it's very dramatic but also settle
0:48at the same time so it's not too
0:50you know it's not - punchy I love watching other youtubers and I love
0:53watching what other people are doing because it's so fun to be inspired I
0:57normally wouldn't do this look at myself but after watching her as I was like man
1:00you know I got to give this a try
1:02so i hope i did her look justice if you want to see how i created this and keep
1:06watching
1:07let's get started now I haven't used my Bobby Brown vitamin face base in a
1:13minute this is what i normally use on the daily if you've never tried this
1:17get the fuck out of your seat and get in the car and go to support at now
1:23Beauty Blender actually just put out a new color this is the nude ache I love
1:28this color
1:29I love to just take this put it in and you're just going to coat your entire
1:34face with this and this is really good for people with normal to dry skin oily
1:39I would stay away from this and get something a little more mattifying for
1:42foundation I'm going to be using my trusty do your air flash you guys know I
1:46can't live without this and i also tried a new cocktail normal and mixes with the
1:52Armani but today i'm going to be using that lower mercier silk creme
1:57photo finish foundation now I got to shade a little darker than my normal
2:02skin tone just like a little more bronzy i'm going to take the air flashes usual
2:07now we're going to take this guy and i'm going to be using the artiste old
2:13brushes
2:14I'm going to probably break the rules and just apply the foundation on the
2:17garage and before I brush it i'm going to . it around my entire face
2:23now the reason why i like this is it really cuts down the time of blending
2:26it's like minimal and you're pretty much done quicker than you've ever gotten
2:31ready your whole entire life so let's get to brushing and blending all right
2:41now because this foundation is a little bit warmer
2:44i am going to do some really light concealer so I'm gonna take that urban
2:48decay naked skin it looks really full-coverage i think on camera but it
2:52just blends really nice and the cool thing about this product as a little
2:56goes a long way so you don't want to overdo it
3:00now i'm actually going to take the Beauty Blender and buff this out
3:04so let's get to blending all right concealer is blended now before the
3:15under eyes want to crease on me
3:17I'm going to be setting it with some loose powder and my favorite is the
3:21Chanel when I keep going back to it and I love to take it with the damp Beauty
3:25Blender and all this literally go like this and dip in and there's some powder
3:29on it and I just pressed it under my eyes and blood and tap it in
3:34all right under eyes are set now i'm actually going to set my entire face
3:38with Studio Fix from mac cosmetics I've been doing that forever and that's just
3:43like my go-to secret to keeping on that foundation throughout the whole day so
3:47I'm going to take my trusty Tom Ford powder brush
3:50we're just going to dip into that studio fix and I'm not going to do the under
3:54eye areas but i'm going to go around everything else
4:00all right now let's contour the face for contour i'm gonna be using the morphe em
4:06five to seven
4:08ever since I saw Jacqueline use it I got five of these brushes and can't stop
4:12using it so thanks for the tip girl
4:14I'm gonna be going in with my trusty Kat Von D shade and light I want to try
4:17something new where I don't go as deep into
4:19a contour as I normally do why because I'm just trying to stuff so I'm going to
4:25start my client or a little normal then I usually do and i'm going to stop right
4:31there usually go a lot lower
4:33but i want a different type of effect today and that's the cool thing about
4:36makeup as you can literally have a different face shapes with look if you
4:39want to
4:42now we're just gonna carve out this chin and just contour along the hairline
4:47all right now i use this more p-47 brush the other day and I really liked it for
4:54the nose
4:55i blend it out with the Beauty Blender and I just like the effect now the cool
4:58thing about this one it really chisels so if you don't want to save your nose
5:01contour try something else
5:03but this one made my nose really slender honey like she's going at it if you guys
5:13randomly hear my dog delicious
5:15screaming in the background there's people hanging curtains and doing
5:18construction in my house so he's going a little cuckoo
5:22all right for brows i'm actually going to draw them on with the new pencil on
5:26estas da came out with a new product called the brow definer and i'm going to
5:31use shade blonde today
5:34this is my first time ever using this so let's see what happens
5:38I think I'm a good critique at formula and this one's really great sharp
5:47all right now I'm going to finish up the brows with the pro pencil from on estas
5:54yet now I love this because it's a nice highlight and i'm just going to put this
5:58directly under the brow and i'm going to take a mac 252 brush and just soften
6:05that line
6:06now let's get started on the eyeshadow for this look I'm going to be using the
6:14Anasazi of self-made palette now Jaclyn credible I like with this so I'm going
6:19to use the same thing i'm going to be going in first with sherbert being on
6:24right there and that's going to be our
6:26transition color and I'm gonna be going in with a morphy 441 blending brush and
6:32I'm just gonna get in there and pump it out
6:36hey there's no big fans are bringing the transition color all the way here just
6:41because my face is longer i like to give it that extra and you really want this
6:47well blended so spend a lot of time going back and forth and i'm actually
6:52going to take that same mac 252 brush and just blend this out a little bit
6:56with no product it's the one I used earlier and we're just going to soften
7:00and then go back to the other side and repeat all right now let's go in with a
7:08mac 217 brush and I'm going to be dipping into this color right here hot
7:12chocolate and we're going to start by taking that color and tucking it into
7:17the crease here and bringing it down to the lid and I was doing packing motions
7:23so we're going to avoid any fallout
7:26all right now i'm going to be taking a pencil brush this one is from chanel its
7:33number 19 i love this one at the pencil brush but it's still kind of dough me
7:38and more thick at the top
7:40instead of being really narrow so you can use any pencil brush that you want
7:43and we're still going to be using the hot chocolate shade
7:46this time I'm just going to be going in side here and this is how we're going to
7:51create that halo effect and just pack in that color
7:56and then I'm going to take my brush right of the transition color and just
7:59soften these edges out a little more now for the middle color this was like my
8:05favorite part of Jaclyn's look was that metallic shimmer in the middle i'm going
8:10to be taking this mac brush you don't brush you use it so much the number
8:15wears off you have to like put it in the light like this is a 230 grow up have
8:22this brush for like ten fucking years i'm going to be using the pink champagne
8:25color right here now if you wet the brush this shit is like oh it's heaven
8:30so we're going to take my fixed plus as usual and we're just gonna and then
8:34you're going to go in with that color and just quote your brush with it and
8:39just start placing it right on the lid oh my lord
8:43oh so pretty i want to die like I don't know if I want to be buried in this
8:48color on my funeral and I was going back and forth and packing and I'm bringing
8:52it right up to that transition color but not going on top of it
8:57so you want to stop it right as you get to that and now that that metallic
9:01colors laid down you're going to go back in with your brush to add the hot
9:05chocolate you're just going to kind of blend out the edges softly I didn't put
9:08any new shadow on this I'm just kind of going back and forth so now for under
9:12the brow we're going to be highlighting a little bit i'm going to be using the
9:14shade up here called the buttery
9:16I'm just going to take this and softly and blend it on top just so it gives it
9:21a little more dimension to my love
9:24now run to the I'm going to take that illamasqua I painful this is shade valve
9:29it's like a screaming flesh Tony white it's not the stark white I normally wear
9:33it's a more yellow tone which I love so I'm going to add that in my waterline
9:38now you can do any color you want with this brown black whatever i lo lighter
9:43tones because it really just opened up her eye and gets you a new look
9:47all right now we need to start smoking out the under eyes so let's get started
9:50on that smoke out the under eyes I'm gonna be taking this Smith cosmetics -
9:5420 brush
9:55i love how lattices it's really good for tucking under the eye
9:58and I'm gonna be going in with hot chocolate one more time and i'm just
10:02going to start upping that color and and connecting it with the outer parts
10:08this part like doing surgery will be really delicate if you are heavy-handed
10:13definitely pause and take like 20 hits forming now i'm using this mac 217 brush
10:18that we did already up here and I didn't put any new product on it i'm just going
10:22to be blending it out
10:24all right now for extra drama I'm going to be adding in a little bit of glitter
10:29in my inner corner and i'm going to be using this mac reflex read this letter
10:34is so pretty it's hard to tell on camera and so I put on my I but it's like
10:38intense and i'm just going to be putting that down with a little map
10:42- 13 brush you definitely want to put down he said because the reflex fine
10:46glitters tend to go everywhere so i'm going to be using this violet evolved
10:50loose pigment glitter adhesive and I'm gonna take like the tiniest amount is
10:55the tiny that is and just place it in my inner corner right there
11:00now i just take the glitter and open it and I just dip right in there your brush
11:05should become completely coated and I'll just knock off the little fallout back
11:09into the jar and then you're just going to press it right on there
11:12all right now for mascara i'm gonna be using my toothpaste better than sex and
11:16uses in a minute
11:16definitely been missing it I heard a rumor on Instagram mother coming with a
11:21waterproof version helpful thank God thank you lord
11:24let me just coat these entirely all right now for the bottom we're going to
11:27use the same thing and we're just going to coat them entirely you really need
11:32bottom mascara for this look because
11:34as well any part of mascara everydays now it's time for eyelashes may be using
11:38these blinking beauty lashes it says its style number two on the front so let's
11:43give them a world now I've been staying away from the latex duo but my inner
11:47corners never come up when i use it so I'm gonna be going back in and using
11:51this will let the glue dry on this one and we'll do the left i don't mean least
12:01the Lopez
12:02ok I can't believe I did these sober but my lashes are done
12:06so now it's time for the main event highlighting
12:10ok so i think because highlighting is becoming so popular every brand from
12:15joint store to high-end is creating one

0:18what's up everyone welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to be using
0:22something really special
0:25- I know what it is well i'm sure you can tell from the title but BAM
0:30the new great girl tart collaboration this is the swamp Queen palette listen
0:36first of all before I even looked in the inside I was dying for the packaging it
0:40looks like real wood
0:41this is amazing and sticks to the Holt our family but it is so funny like it
0:47I just I just smiled here to here when I open this the pr package you guys was
0:51genius i mean i-i got a little alligator
0:54I don't want you to be so cute delicious tried to tell him and I was like no this
0:59is the cutest thing ever and it came in
1:00come on alligator wrapping paper
1:04I can't alright so her collaboration is this amazing palette it has I shadows
1:09that has a blush bronzer and a highlight I'm like uh-huh sure you guys know just
1:15getting but this is I just can't stop looking at me like oh it's just so
1:18pretty okay
1:18the reveal bail
1:22so go ahead you guys but he also made two lipsticks which ok now this one when
1:28me and Bonnie first met a few months ago I was in Texas and she picked me up to
1:33go to the mall and we had such a fun time and she was wearing a lip and I was
1:36like girl what is that lipstick and she was in the testing phase of this one so
1:42it's so cool to see it done and on my mouth because high this color is
1:46everything this palette and the lips as a collection they are limited edition
1:51and they will be on targets website starting june six and then they slowly
1:55start to roll out into all the stores a few weeks later so don't sleep on this
1:59today i created this entire I look and the lip using this collection so I think
2:05we should have a dive right in but before we play with this
2:08I just want to say that I think it is so amazing that all these youtubers are
2:12collapsing with a really huge brand
2:15and it's it's just wild because I come from working at the mat counter and back
2:20then only a huge corporation with you know they would collab with like huge
2:24celebrities or that type of thing so the fact that all these brands are believing
2:28in you tubers and makeup artist i think is really really dope so the fact that
2:33bunny got to do this is so just so real and I'm so proud of her so bunny you
2:38really killed it with this though I'm going to dive in and let's start playing
2:42today we're going to start off by priming my eyelids with the Urban Decay
2:44primer potion
2:46I know everyone is probably like oh my god why are using primer today I'm just
2:51in a mood i saw someone use this in a review again and i was like i forgot i
2:55have primers so why not use it like to put a lot on why not right now this one
3:00is limited edition what is this one called enigma
3:04hi nygma and instead of using my fingers I'm just going to apply this with a
3:08brush all over the lid and i'm going to bring it up even to almost my eyebrow
3:14ok now that the primer is settled let's dive into the palate now you guys know I
3:19love to do a really light shadow all over for my base so i'm going to use a
3:23baby with a flat synthetic brush and I'm just going to put it over my
3:28lids now I love the shade right off the bat because it literally almost matches
3:33my skin tone so it's going to be a perfect base for me and I'm just going
3:37to drag this up an hour
3:39okay for my transition color I'm going to go right in and use dog man this is
3:42such a dope
3:44rusty brown like warm like orange base
3:48that was a long explanation but it looks really really pretty so I'm just going
3:53to take a little what is this
3:55this is a little mac - it's set in and we're just going to go right in with
3:58this one
3:59now i'm just going to take this and blend it right into my socket oh good
4:04morning
4:05this color is oh so pretty
4:08i'm really loving warm tones I think for like ten years I just wore hot blue
4:13black silver and glitter
4:15so I'm kind of 11 getting back into the season now i'm going to take this and
4:19bring it right down to their so we're gonna kind of line that up with my
4:25eyebrows start blending into that nose contour for an extreme smokey look and
4:32I'm going to bring this down and go little my lash line
4:35not too much so we're just kind of creating a little the eyeshadows just
4:39hugging my entire I now we're going to go in with a little blending brush any
4:43eyeshadow blending brush that you love
4:45now we're going to get back in the dog man just ever so slightly and we're just
4:50gonna drag up
4:52and that light shadow that I already applied earlier is really going to help
4:55buffer and blend this out
4:57obviously the brush is doing its job but this is just a little extra just a
5:02little extra precaution and it just really helps make it look really nice
5:06I'm gonna go back in one more time you guys know smokey eyes a lot of back and
5:09forth back and forth
5:11you want to blend until you have carpal tunnel the next day because we're not
5:15playing games today and then you're going to want to repeat the same steps
5:19on the other eye and make it look identical
5:23all right now we're going to go back with that same brush and I'm going to
5:25dip into sippy sippy
5:27hi it's a really that's the cue same name
5:30I love this color it's like a chocolaty maroonish brown
5:35I know my trust me i know my color explanations are ridiculous
5:40I love it the undertone of this is so pretty it has like little fine
5:43sparkles of golden it so we don't get right into her and I'm going to put this
5:49in my crease so it makes it really deep set and then we're going to drag this
5:54down a little more
5:56so that's going to give us the illusion of like a really deep set like full
5:59i M and notice how I'm still leaving space in there for maybe nothing maybe
6:04color maybe liner and I know what I want to do yet but I'm going to spring this a
6:08little more and then if you want you can go back in with your blending brush and
6:13head dog man
6:15and go in
6:16there and blend it out even more depends on how blended you want to be but I
6:20think you for watching my channel you want to be blend did
6:24so let's start doing it all right now I took that darkness and I brought it out
6:29a little past there and then you're going to take this again
6:33let it in together and just kind of flick up and out and then we're going to
6:36go back in with sippy sippy and do the same thing over here
6:41all right we are blended and looking smokey
6:45so this is like a beautiful champagne gold and i was going to take this little
6:51math 242 brush is already glitter on this from the other day so ignore that
6:55that's on the other side so we're going to go and i'm just going to place this
7:00right in there
7:02top of the line now
7:03this shadow is yummy that was thinking about wedding the brush for like extra
7:09intensity but it's so pretty as it is and like I don't need to come on
7:13amazing formula i love an eye shadow it doesn't fucking x games and we're just
7:17going to pack a little more on put a lot on that inner corner like I want my
7:22inner corner to look extra terrestrial today
7:26who so I'm going to bring it all the way in to where my brow bone and my nose
7:31connect because i'm just that type of bitch today
7:35and then we're going to go back in with this brush one more time and you don't
7:38have to dip into it again if you don't want to but I'm just gonna blend out the
7:42gold and the brown a little bit so it just blends more seamlessly from one
7:47seamless blend
7:48how's your day all right now because you guys know I cannot live without more
7:51Sparkle and gold i'm going to just take sassy button one more time and I'm gonna
7:56put some in my inner corner and i'm actually gonna bring it down in to the
8:01lower lash line up like I cannot with this color you guys
8:06hi anyone from tar is watching I'm going to sassy by a single shadow for my
8:10birthday this year
8:11ok so i want to bring it to bar in because I'm gonna smoke out this bottom
8:15but i think that is good enough and now we're going to darken and smoking out
8:19the under eye so I'm going to dab in a little bit with a man cat and i'm going
8:24to start that off and i'm just going to take this really flat synthetic brush
8:27and
8:28i'm going to just start lightly shading under my eyes and then we're going to
8:33blend it in with that gold and i am going to add in liner to my waterline
8:38I don't know what I should do maybe you to the black or cream or white
8:42so let me just smoked out this a little bit more
8:46and then we'll figure out the liner all right now that there's smoked out
8:50I'm going to darken them a little bit more and make them like really blend
8:53nicely i'm going to make them blend out a little more you know it's a little
8:56more smoky right now the edges are not how I want them so i'm just going to use
9:00a little the morphe brush high and we're going to get in with madcat one more
9:05time and now this is really gonna give me that ability to like smoke it out way
9:10more
9:11jharkhand dramatic I need that effortless blend
9:15mm-hmm now this little detailed shader brush really lets you get in there
9:19without causing a lot of fallout and it just really blends nicely
9:23all right now it's time to add something in my waterline and I don't know if I
9:28wanted you back and really like intensify my eyes or if I want to do a
9:33cream liner

1:56Beauty Blender a damn . of course we're just gonna . around now the cool thing
2:01about this is you do not need a lot of product this covers your entire face
2:05so let's get to blending
2:12I'm just going to set my foundation and do my brows off camera which you can see
2:18how i do all that in my official face routine which is on my channel so i'll
2:22be like that
2:23all right now that my face is officially on let's get down to the look now
2:27because i'm going to be doing a lot of bright neon today i'm gonna be using the
2:31cat Mundy high voltage eyeshadow primer
2:35I love to apply this with back to 52 brush and i just use a . if you've ever
2:40used this before you know
2:42a little goes a long way with all of our products so I'm just gonna . my lid and
2:46then take this brush and start sweeping it all over
2:50so my knee and I shadows stay put and as always i'm going to sweep a little bit
2:56under the eye but not too much
2:59now we can get to our eye shadow now i'm gonna be using this busy our editorial
3:05eyeshadow palette this white color you guys I've used before
3:08this is my favorite is a nice and base for bright shadows and i'm going to be
3:13using this pink on this one
3:15and for the yellow i pulled out one of my old mac eyeshadow palette that I made
3:20myself so this yellow is called chrome yellow
3:23so we're going to be dipping into this color today as well with the same
3:25brushes my primer for i'm going to be going right to that matt white
3:31and I'm gonna highlight my brow bone with the shade and also put it online
3:38higher I area now notice how I am doing packing motions I want to pack this
3:44eyeshadow in so it does not leave me
3:47and we're going to pack pack pack all right now the first color I'm to be
3:51laying down
3:52is this bright pink now i'm gonna be using a more feet 4 11 brush to pack
3:58some of that in
3:59I'm gonna saturate this brush completely and then if you want to avoid fallout
4:03down
4:04now i'm going to start this look I'm gonna be doing three colors pink yellow
4:08pink i'm going to start this by just packing on the pink on the outside all
4:15the way to the lash line and then backing up a little bit
4:21and once again i'm doing a lot of tapping motions so it acts in that color
4:25and it has minimal fallout and this is just going to be our guide so this is
4:29not have to look perfect this is just to start
4:31look then we're going to take that pink then tuck it inside
4:39so notice how i'm leaving an area in the middle for that yellow color
4:44my eye doesn't look like a unicorn threw up on it in 10 minutes
4:49we don't have a fucking problem now to create this trifecta we're gonna pop a
4:53color right in the middle and start blending back and forth so i'm going to
4:57be using this morphy pulling that brush this doesn't have a number but it's from
5:01the bling collection
5:02I'm obsessed with this time like the present to eat it I'm going to saturate
5:06the brush so it's like me on on there and then we're just going to place it in
5:10the middle and you want to buffer it back and forth and really press it in
5:15there so it sticks and if you blend good enough it should turn a little bit
5:21orange around the corners so that pink and yellow are basically like getting
5:27married and having a baby in your eyelid and then you can take some color and
5:31start landing
5:33so if you're I does not look like a sunset by now you have some issue girl
5:39ok now to soften the lines up here we're going to be taking a mac 224 brush and
5:46we're going to dip into the pink and lightly merge the top together so i do
5:51not want this black raccoon rainbow I I want it to look very soft and pretty so
5:56we're just going to take a little bit of pink on this
5:59and follow the line that we've already created and just start blending up and
6:05just softening it now if you want to make the top even more blendable we go
6:11back in with that white color and we lightly go over the pink again and that
6:19looks very airbrush and I say Russia loss that's the effect that we're going
6:23when i add any darkness to my under eye i'm going to be taking this more feet
6:28e3 brush which by the way feels like velvet
6:31lowered and I'm gonna be taking this Laura Mercier pressed setting powder and
6:36I want to just place a little under my eyes
6:38so only reason why I'm doing this you haven't seen videos and other videos
6:41because I want to really smoke out the bottom and I don't want to deal with any
6:45fallout
6:45I was always going to be going in with my Mac smaller eye pencil this has been
6:49my favorite black eyeliner since like the beginning of time so I'm just going
6:54to take a damp Beauty Blender and as always
6:58slightly pull down so I'm not ruining the elasticity of my eyes and I'm just
7:05putting this directly in the water line doesn't have to be perfect we're going
7:08to smoke it out in a second

4:28now i'm going to bring it up a little bit on my near the hairline and drag it
4:32up a little bit
4:34no I'm going to be taking this makeup forever
4:40big old man brush and I'm just going to go back in with that contour color and
4:45just chill out this chin a little bit for that define look and was going to
4:50soften that line with my Beauty Blender for the nose today I'm actually just
4:54going to take this brush and put a little product on it just half wait here
4:59and I'm just going to take it and run it down my nose where I want the color just
5:05a just a quick little to second notes job
5:08you will now I'm really defining the nose and I'm going to soften it in a
5:12second so if it looks a little too crazy
5:14you can always turn it down like this is for Valentine's so I want my nose like
5:19severe I don't want to break up with me because I didn't find her enough now
5:23that my nose looks crazy
5:25I'm going to take the Beauty Blender and just up over the line and just kind of
5:30soften them a little bit
5:31ok now let's get to the eyes
5:34all right now for eyes today I'm going to keep it really really simple like you
5:39guys are gonna be blown away how easy this is for Valentine's I want it to be
5:42really soft really pretty so I pulled out my too faced chocolate bonbon
5:47palette I love
5:48love this one first of all it's think so i'm already obsessed and oh that
5:53chocolate smell kills me
5:55I'm just going to dip into this color divinity which is a really light nude
5:59color and I'm just gonna take this from brow to lid and just coat my entire I
6:05with it
6:06we apply it is you smell the cocoa powder and you're like instantly hungry
6:09I'm like oh I want an ice cream sundae right now with a Cinnabon and strawberry
6:14lemonade
6:15oh my god now this color almost matches my skin tone which is exactly what I
6:20wanted
6:20it's just going to be a little base for us to get started make sure I shadows
6:24blend seamlessly
6:26all right now I'm just going to put a really soft brown color in the crease
6:30and I'm going to use my morphe 441 brush now the shade is called on the trouble
6:35right here
6:35it's like a really soft ma be brown I want to cut the brush completely and
6:40really get the color in there by and we're just going to tuck this into my
6:46crease and this is a really soft color
6:49we're going to be really gentle today I'm so used to seeing like bright colors
6:53are really bold right away I'm like oh like I'm not wearing anything
6:57my wrist is like bitch add more color all right now for the lid i'm going to
7:01use a metallic bronze color this is called molasses chip and this is this
7:06guy right here i'm going to just take my mac 217 brush and dip in there
7:12now usually with metallics like to wet the brush or a crazy effect let's see if
7:15this one wants to show up on my lid today
7:18oh I love that really soft
7:23all right now I'm gonna take this NARS eyeshadow
7:27it just came out and it's called turbos it's like this pretty minch like a
7:32greenish color I love and I'm actually going to add the screen color on the top
7:36of some of the brown just to give it some extra flavor and i'm going to just
7:40wet the brush always with my max plus now when you use these wet like they
7:45recommend it's like whoa
7:47so let's see what happens
7:49I live for a bitch and I'm just going to place it directly in the middle so I'm
7:56not doing my whole lid just the center now normally i would add a lot of
8:01darkness in my crease but i'm actually gonna not do that today
8:04oh god it was so weird all right now to soften those edges i'm going to be
8:08taking the same almond tropical color here and just popping over it and over
8:14it real quick
8:15all right now for under the eye i'm going to keep it really soft and gentle
8:19and i'm going to take this color in the palette called satin sheets
8:23it's like champagne the shimmery peachy
8:27I don't know it's just that's amazing i'm going to take my mac 239 brush the
8:31little guy and just dip in there
8:34I want to coat that whole brush and I'm just going to go right on the inner
8:37corner and add in that color and i'm going to bring it slightly down where
8:42it's a little bit under the eye
8:44just a little soft effect you know what's cool about these eyeshadows is
8:48you can actually use color as a highlight which I did the other day and
8:53it looked so pretty
8:54so there's ever anything metallic in your palate dip it in honey and pay
8:58those cheeks
9:01ok so now that that's done i'm just going to take that same with morphy 441
9:09brush and I'm gonna dip into this color one more time and I'm actually just
9:14going to take it under my eye and just lightly buff under it so just give you
9:20that soft brown
9:25and we're going to slightly drag that shadow out a little bit
9:29ok now what is going to make these eyes stand out really crazy i think is that
9:34mascara and the big lashes once you add those things to your eyes it always
9:39gives you that like oh ok
9:41there it is look all right now I'm gonna take my Too Faced better than sex
9:45mascara and coat the entire top and bottom before we do some lashes
9:52now let's do the lot of mascara
9:59now when you don't have a lot of dramatic eye shadow underneath he would
10:05be really careful not to bump your skin with a brush
10:08so I'm just going over this a few times so it's like extra tarantula
10:13now I want the latches to be the main focus of this luck since it's so soft
10:18and gentle so i'm going to be using the Buddha beauty
10:21Farrah lashes now it's time to put some lash glue on and get these bitches a
10:27warm
10:33I am obsessed with how these look they're so light blue
10:38they almost look like eyelash extensions they're so pretty I'm probably never

11:36all right the highlighting is done now what we can do for the lips
11:40all right since it's so dry out and I've been a little under the weather i'm

2:58so this white one looks amazing it's called prohibition pub and i'm just
3:03going to be dipping into their morning
3:06let's start blending now I want this really light under my brow bone so
3:10obviously if you are not really pale like me use a color that little more to
3:14your skin tone
3:15this one can be really harsh but i'm going for that doll like effect today
3:21do you guys ever have this moment where you kind of like you're right eyebrow
3:25more than left
3:26now listen when you have to draw him on every single day and try to match them
3:30sometimes i like the right one a little more and that's definitely happening
3:33today
3:35now i'm going to do is some warm tone little smoky neon drama in my crease
3:41before we try out that liner and i'm going to be starting off with my violet
3:46of Oz holy grail palette i have been using this so much off camera
3:50like what I've been going out lately to events and stuff I've really been
3:53obsessed with this one high hashtag is like a godsend so we're gonna be dipping
3:58into that one today
3:59the fuck brushes this is the mac 217 I'm going to coat my entire brush
4:03BAM off this is such a good warm neutral color
4:07literally my new favorite so then i'm also going to take some and bring it a
4:12little bit down on the lash line and understanding really soft and gentle and
4:16dragging it out now that this transition color is laid down
4:22I'm going to dip into my melt cosmetics radioactive eyeshadow stack these are so
4:27pretty
4:28oh hi good morning the shade is called radon and i am going to be placing this
4:35right over what we just did and i'm going to start on just that this half of
4:40my eyes so just the outer edges or corners and that white shadow should
4:45really help to blend this and make it look pretty but a dip into that Lauren
4:49I'm actually gonna bring it down
4:50I just love the wait neons look blend it out
4:54so I'm actually going to bring it and even more so this is really going to
4:57give us that plastic doll like appearance with that really dramatic
5:02like who
5:04hi now i'm going to go back into this palette and dip into this beautiful warm
5:08chocolate brown shade is called Islander and i'm going to take this little mac -
5:1221 in detail brush and I'm just going to add and a little bit of warmth and depth
5:18to my crease really lights almost like we are doing surgery let me lift up my
5:23head a little bit
5:25now there will be light are going there so I'm not going to connect it if you're
5:28like bitch what the hell time to drive assistant Lee eyeliner we're going to
5:31put it to the test
5:33we're gonna give it a world
5:36all right now i'm going to start dragging the wing
5:42now i will say this liner does have a lot of pigment usually by now have to
5:47like shake and twirl and try to get more pigment out but this that keeps on
5:52coming out
5:53I'm surprised the eyeliner keeps on coming it's kind of like my last bukkake
5:57it's just not stopping
5:58and i still this still has pigment maybe because it's holding it down and it's
6:02like seeping into the applicator which would be genius
6:05hi but uh this is still full of liner like it's not stopping
6:17one side and down one to go
6:22who she's take the wheel alright guys we finally hit our first snag the ink is
6:28drying out where the liner excuse me and it is getting kind of hard to use this
6:36is not acceptable
6:38it is drying up a little bit so i'm going to close it
6:41give it a minute and we're back ok so basically we had to shake it and twirl
6:48it and now we're back
6:50ok alright so let's finish this I so I want to see how this is gonna wear
6:55throughout the day but so far
6:57who I'm like I like it I like it a lot
7:01first impressions it's black it's great full coverage and I need a full coverage
7:06liner
7:07now it does it beat the kat von d liner it has its pros and cons this brush is
7:12bigger and I felt like I could do the top part quicker but kind of the same so
7:17do i think it's worth seventy dollars up
7:20not really sorry I was so high on LSD i forgot to put my white liner on
7:25so I'm going to take my mac fascinating as always and we're just going to paint
7:29that water line
7:31ghost white but be careful it doesn't touch the black liner it will turn gray
7:35and I don't want to grab my water
7:38once that whites in their bitch it's over it's like I game changer
7:42now today before my lashes i'm going to try a new mascara as well
7:46this is that nor couture black satin mascara
7:50now listen this kind of looks like the top of my packaging so I was obviously
7:54drawn in by the Stars this component is really cute
7:58now here's what got me when I saw this bullshit at the mall y'all see that
8:02ok so we're going to give it a world today I'd never use this brand-new fresh
8:06out the tube
8:07so let's try it together I don't know how that you're supposed to use this but
8:11let's try
8:12no not really seeing that much of a difference here
8:16definitely not all no not really loving this one in the drawer she goes now
8:23Sicily same brand as the liner
8:26they have any mascara how you got that this week today I haven't tried it this
8:30is the so curl deep black mascara love this cute little too but now the brush
8:37has a slight little angle
8:39ok q let's try this one
8:42oh wow okay already uplifting now
8:45not that this is like a huge huge difference but it definitely lifted my
8:51lashes more like on this side of definitely didn't know now bottom
8:56mascara is very key with this look because we are doing no shadow I know it
9:00breaks my heart as well it's really weird but I feel like if you have no
9:04shadow without white liner it's very uplifting and very mannequin like so I'm
9:09gonna hoping prince was not fuck up my bottom lashes or twice call me a problem
9:15now today for false lashes i'm gonna be using the hood of beauty
9:22Farrah mmm these 3d foam inks girl
9:26now when I talked a few videos ago about lash glue and how i hated smell you guys
9:32like overwhelmingly sent me thousands of tweets and snapchat about the house of
9:39lashes glue and now he said it smelled amazing and it was really good and held
9:42on my inner corners so so pleasant
9:48I've tried this over the last few days it does really work great shout out to
9:53house of lashes hi love you and we're just going to paint that entire lash and

10:57bam bam that's all you need girl and I'm just going to place this right above my
11:03contour

11:16duh being can you see me now
11:19now that I'm blinding everybody let's get down to the lips her lips today I'm
11:24going to kind of a classic nineties nude lip I'm going to start by using this mac
11:28lip liner in shade hover and i'm just going to outline my entire lives
11:39so I'm kind of creating a little ombre effect already
11:42by just taking a pencil and just kind of looking up really lightly so it just
11:46gives it the more soft appearance while giving you a harsh darker line down here
11:51all right we are live line but now for lipstick today I'm gonna be pulling out
11:57a little christian louboutin
11:59if you've never seen this packaging oh I mean this a full-blooded Instagram and
12:04when my favorite shoe brand create a lipstick I about died so i picked one of
12:09the mat nude shades hi packaging is amazing
12:13good morning now i'm just gonna take it out of the packaging
12:16you just have to unscrew the top off and it comes out
12:20hi this looks like a Christmas ornament or it could be a butt plug
12:25the packaging is genius expensive it feels amazing
12:29now this shade is called to tell i'm not sure how you say that I think it's
12:34French so there
12:35that this shade is such a pretty gorgeous nude
12:41let's try it oh I'm dying I don't need more of just applying more because it
12:45just feels so damn good
12:48this is such like a pretty everyday color
12:51now I like to do is I'll go back in with the lip pencil and i will just cut a
12:57lightly go over the lines again just so you keep that kind of our great fact now
13:04I think the only thing that is stopping me from being done is a little setting
13:09spray and a damn winged now besides using my favorite Urban Decay all
13:13nighter
13:14I found something new at the mall now heals the skin care i have loved and

1:35really light eyeshadow and put it from the brow all the way to my lash line and

2:35pack and pack this on all right now it's time to start adding in the purple
2:42we're going to start laying down the foundation of our purple
2:45I with Kaitlyn rose
2:48now I love to saturate my brush completely before i start and then I'll
2:52not go all out by now I'm gonna bring this purple all the way down to the lash
3:01line
3:02just a little bit here what kind of creates a c-like movement
3:08all right now we're going to stop in these harsh edges on the top
3:12we're going to be dipping into mess created a shadow
3:16now i'm just going to take this on the brush and I'm gonna go over what I've
3:20already done and just start dragging it up so it just gives you that more
3:25airbrushed appearance and really nice soft landing
3:29notice how I'm bringing it a little bit down on my nose
3:32now i'm going to go back with that light color from this palette and i'll be
3:37going back and forth and just blending and buffing it out until it looks super
3:41airbrush
3:46now I'm gonna be taking max smaller eye pencil and i'm going to be just putting
3:50black in my waterline and we're going to use that to pop down and mix purple

4:31I love it I'm going to different at first then we're going to go back in
4:34here and we're going to dip in so my brush basically has two colors on it
4:39I'm just going to start popping and dragging this over the black liner and
4:45using it just smudge it out and create some purple amazingness
4:51now i'm even going over a little bit of the silver just so it mixes in with the
4:56purple so it stays looking really smoke down but then as a purple effect to it
5:01and now I'm going to take that staying back to 24 blending brush and we're just
5:06going to take a little bit on here
5:08get rid of that fall out and I'm just gonna put it right in the ER and blend
5:15and mix those together so it looks really a brushed

1:03utilizing the beauty killer palette for the eyes but I'm gonna do a little fast
1:07forward and show you guys that face routine just in case you don't need a
1:11little refresher
1:12so today I'm actually gonna go back in with my law / a foundation now I
1:16reviewed this a few weeks ago to know a lot of your like having anyone and it's
1:20actually really really dope so i'm going to apply a lot of this on and i'm gonna
1:25be using my artiste overall a brush
1:28I'm obsessed with these brushes like I'm just going to take this out of the thing
1:33hi spatula and just like last time i was going to paint them on you know me I
1:37like to go really overboard me overboard
1:40never now I didn't build this up last time i used it and off camera i've been
1:46wearing a lot and it's just really pretty it has this like luminosity to it
1:51that most foundations do not have come on forehead and
1:56and bam all you do is you're going to take this brush and you're just gonna
1:59brush it around your skin and it literally covers it
2:04wick like oh hi hi left side of my face you already done and you're just gonna
2:09massage it into your skin and brush it on
2:14oh we just have a moment of silence for how good the shit smiles I'm just like
2:17all right now
2:20the concealer that was in this guy-- it's a little too heavy for me under my
2:23eyes I don't like to cake on all that makeup
2:26I don't really need it myself so I'm just going to go back to my old school
2:30jeffree star method I've coating my entire face with Studio Fix so we find a
2:35big old brush my favorite powder brushes is Tom 405 brush it's just like it's
2:41perfect so we're going to dip into this guy and cover my entire mug
2:45so we're just creating a really mannequin like masks today if you don't
2:49need as much foundation just fast forward but if you do
2:53pause and apply it with me and notice how I'm kind of like smashing the brush
2:57into my face
2:58I am packing it on a much just kind of like aa girl
3:03you can't do that you gotta pack it into the skin because we are not going to be
3:07touching up later we are too busy for that we got too much way too small too
3:12many dicks to suck and we got too many shopping trips to do so we're going to
3:16hack it and pack it on and of course we're not going to forget our neck
3:21we're going to avoid grandma was that girl and we're going to adjust our ears
3:24ever so slightly
3:25all right now highlight and contour an old-school trick that I've been doing
3:29since the myspace days is I found this mac studio fix it is literally ghost
3:34white
3:35so instead of packing on all that concealer under the eyes which I don't
3:38really need it all the time i'm just going to take this little nars kabuki
3:41brush and I just like to buff this under my eyes almost like a little upside down
3:47like triangle motion we're gonna bring it all the way to my hairline
3:51because I do like that extreme glamour and we're just gonna stuff it under and
3:56blend it in
3:58just really get that in there and that will ensure it does not move throughout
4:02the day
4:03now other areas that I do love to highlight because i'd like to look very
4:07plastic
4:08I love doing a little bit on the chin haha no chickens been a minute how you
4:13doing girl how's your morning
4:15all right now we're highlighting the gods it's time to contour the space a
4:17little bit
4:18now i'm going to try something today we're don't go with severe huh
4:21I know I I couldn't do that came out of my mouth either but I'm just trying to
4:26look today so I'm gonna be using my little Chanel foundation bronzer brush
4:29I love the sky it's like airbrush on a stick and hi kat von d how are you I'm
4:34just gonna dip into that middle one and just got lightly on the darker one and
4:38I'm just gonna just chill these cheeks a little bit
4:41hmm now i'm just going to do a little circular but emotions and i'm only going
4:45to do my contoured here today usually you guys my love to go all the way down
4:48but i'm just gonna softly do it this way today I just see how i like it if I hate
4:53it great
4:53cool thing about makeup is it washes off and you can have new cheekbones tomorrow
4:57so lets buff out this face forehead nose and chin and pray that we look cute
5:03she's going dark on that for today girl
5:08you know what them wigs got a really great that dimension where bronze buffed
5:13and beautiful now I guess it's a time for some eyebrows
5:17just kidding i forgot my nose mother effer
5:21and now we're going to breathe through these averages using on it starts at
5:25beverly hills dipbrow and brow ways
5:38alright browser on now let's get to these eyes now today i'm going to create
5:44a little go to easy look that i am going to show you mah
5:49oh my war oh my today i'm going to show you a little quick go to look using that
5:59beauty killer palette
6:00oh now you can tell them really obsessed with China white here because the j in
6:04the pan is like the exchange this is like my go-to I talked about this in the
6:09swatch video i have been putting a light color shadow under my brow bone
6:14since the dawn of time so I'm just going to take China white and just bring it
6:19all the way down and i'm just going to coat my entire lid from lash to brow
6:25bone a whole damn thing
6:27now I cast a lot why use a really light shadow of course you can use your
6:31favorite primer which I do do that sometimes but when you're using any
6:34other bright or dark colors this easily blend it out if you didn't have anything
6:39already down there so this is kind of like my primer i guess you could call it
6:43and we're just going to take China white and just butt hurt the gods
6:47now i'm going to take this mac low 22 for blending brush we're going to get
6:50right into Kourtney and this is going to be our transition color this is really
6:54easy
6:55everyone should be able to use this color and we're just going to pop this
6:58right in my crease
7:00it's an easy transition color I think anyone can pull this off
7:03it's going to help you blend out your other shadows or you can literally just
7:06wear this in your crease and pop a lash on and get ready for the day since i
7:11have no eyebrows
7:13I like to be a little bit more dramatic with my shadow so of course if this is
7:17too much for you can tailor and tone it down to fit your needs but i just love
7:21Courtney it's such an easy color it's like if you want to stop from those
7:25edges you can dip back into trying to wait just a little . on your little
7:28blending brush and you can just going to go over the edges and just soften them
7:33out so they look really soft and pretty
7:35i'm really loving and vanity so I want to dip that in
7:39and create kind of a little deep socket in there and I have a special surprise
7:43for you guys ready for the surprise because this isn't even in the
7:46description is the name of the title but i'm going to debut it here for you guys
7:50so I have a collab coming out with morphe brushes yes i am obsessed with
7:55that you guys know how to use them in all my videos I'm going to show you a
7:58little sneak peek of a few of them should we do it should be doing ok we're
8:02doing it
8:03BAM oh this is the first time I'm like really ever showing these and a little
8:07sneak peek on Instagram and these are just four of ten brushes coming out they
8:12are pink
8:13chrome they have the logo on it and the morphe brush logo sorry my lighting is
8:18so it's too pretty it's like not showing my Legos
8:21they are vegan cruelty free and they're so soft now I know a lot of people are
8:27vegan brushes can be a little rough business jeffree star you know the shit
8:29was like I it was good
8:33so I'm gonna be using been minus one more P jeffree star automatic sprinkler
8:37brush and we're going to dip into vanity
8:39I created brushes that only i would use obviously not going to create something
8:43that I would not use on myself so we're just going to dip into this and of
8:47course will do a full reveal with all the brushes soon for a video but i had
8:52to give you guys a little sneak be sleepy so i'm gonna talk vanity right in
8:56my crease and just very own just put her right in there
9:00now i am going to keep my eye makeup really minimal today so this define
9:04crease is detrimental and I'm not going to bring it all the way down my nose to
9:08see how I look this way I look down I just gonna stopped it where the socket
9:12meats and i'm just going to drag and blend it out a little more
9:16yes blending brush feel so soft and it's not like it's a Christmas pie
9:22it's all right now for this lid color notice how i did leave some room right
9:25here i want to pop in some gold now you can put the gold in the middle you can
9:29put it on the corners i don't know what i want to do yet but I'm going to be
9:32dipping into rich bitch with a little synthetic flat brush and I'm going to
9:36coat the entire back and front of this
9:39I don't know where I want to place it yet let's just give it a whirl
9:44and see what happens that brush is a little too small so i swapped it out for
9:48one of my blending brushes and i'm just going to pack this on the lid
9:52oh it is so pretty and I'm gonna put it right below vanity and mm just get a
9:58little schoolgirl
9:59hmm now a little cute trick if you want to wet the brush with your fixed plus it
10:04will make the pigment really stand out so if you want extreme pigment i would
10:09definitely wet the brush a little bit now notice how I'm in it tuck this into
10:14here but not bring it all the way up so I'm just going to kind of bring it down
10:17right there and that's it now for under the eyes you can do really anything you
10:22want a lot of times i like to leave it minimal and not really do much but today
10:27I'm gonna kind of smoke it out because they keep putting in like white or nude
10:32eyeliner on my waterline so I want to give it a little bit of depth today I'm
10:36just going to pop in this max moulder in my waterline
10:40and there we go really thinly and they're not too crazy and i'm using my
10:45Beauty Blender to pull down my lid so I'm not tagging and making myself look a
10:50hundred years old over time
10:52I'm not trying to age and if you want to then girl go for Iggy Pop but i am not
10:56trying to look old black liner is done now I'm gonna smoke this out just a
11:01little bit so I'm just going to dip into a confession and the black liner is

1:45now that i have is amazing bangs I don't browse so we're gonna stick to the very
1:50goth alien jeffree star 10th grade look at how you used to do and to start this
1:56i'm going to coat my entire lid with a white skin color based and today i'm
2:00gonna be using the new Kat Von D shade and light contour quad who is a mouthful
2:07and this is the rust palette I love her new packaging like
2:11hi this is very high
2:12and and these are the four colors that come with it these are not often enough
2:16so we're just going to stick with this light one today just for the base and
2:19then we'll move on to a different palette but let's see if these are
2:22pigment did
2:23oh I and hi cat never fails to deliver so I am already excited
2:30both the entire lid and i'm actually gonna bring the shadow up all the way
2:34and i'm going to take this and pull it all the way back so it would be a lot
2:40easier to blend later
2:42google pastel god there is a different like variation of the looks that
2:46everybody gives it's like mainly a dark lip and kind of light eyes or sometimes
2:50it's like a pastel and really dark
2:52I'm going to give it a little Jeffrey twist and i'm going to dive into this
2:55sugarpill heartbreaker palette and we're going to go riding with this hot glue
2:58called velocity over my lower they are really highly pigmented you touch your
3:04brush once oh good morning and they're ready to play
3:08so I'm going to using my Chanel eyeshadow my blending brush
3:11I love this one and I'm just gonna dive in and start sketching out a little bit
3:17of a crease
3:18if you want you can stretch it out a little higher
3:21or you can stick to your natural crease line
3:25I have no brows I have a little bit more room to play with and I'm definitely
3:28going to be banking on that today so i'm going to take this and since i have no
3:33brows i want to create a long like them and definition to the eyes
3:38i'm going to be taking the shadow
3:39I'm going all the way
3:42and then we're going to drag and this doesn't have to look perfect because we
3:45are going to use another brush to blend up but the base shadow that we
3:49previously just applied is definitely going to help blend everything out
3:53already so I think you all right now i'm going to drag that all the way down to
3:59my lash line
4:00just a little bit in there notice i'm leaving some room for color right here
4:04and color right there i'm going to add into more colors actually so you don't
4:08want to take the blue too far and just kind of doing a half way into my eyelid
4:13and of course we'll puff and blend out that better
4:16so no worries today we're gonna be pulling up this makeup gem this is that
4:20Natasha day Nona palette it's one of the palette she has like a million these
4:24common way you know just like you know one or two shades good morning so I'm
4:29looking at this palette clearly this one this one and this one it needs to get
4:33all on this face so first we take this sky blue amazing this and i'm gonna be
4:38using that sugar pill blending eyeshadow brush and I'm just gonna be dipping into
4:43that one
4:44all right now I'm going to take that color
4:46merge it with that darker one that we just put on and i'm just going to kind
4:51of blend up and out
4:53I'm gonna merge those two and use it as a lending color and then we're going to
4:58go back in with our first blending brush with a little extra product of that cat
5:02palette and we're just gonna blend
5:05come on sky blue and this is where i'm going to drag it out a little bit more
5:09and blue and an o.d yeah i'm going to add in a little pop of colors so I mean
5:15look there are so many options i'm looking down on all these eyeshadows and
5:19I'm just like why did you do this to me why
5:22now there's this really pretty cyborg foiled silver
5:27now I've used this once before and I wedded the brush
5:30I wet the brush when it went better fucking whatever i'm going to use my mac
5:35fix+ this is the lavender flavor and I'm just gonna coat this Bobby Brown little
5:40blending brush and we're just going to dip into that silver and oh my god it's
5:46like whoo
5:47all right we're just going to take that silver right on the lid
5:52yes and just start packing that in there
5:56now if you don't let the brush you might not get the desired intensity that you
6:00want so i definitely recommend doing that and I'm going to take it all the
6:05way down now we are going to blend out this part a little bit in a second so if
6:09you're like girl that was a little janky
6:11I am definitely not done and because my sockets are so big i'm actually going to
6:16bring that silver all the way to my
6:19like nose basically in there and see that my turn to the side it looks so
6:24pretty
6:24now my lids don't look like Terminator I fucked me
6:28then we just didn't do it enough so i'm going to keep layering and layering now
6:32that the silver is down
6:33I definitely need to go in and blend out a little more
6:37so we're just going to go back with their first blue I like to press a
6:41little bit around the edges of where that silver was so we're just kind of
6:45having emerged become besties or you know lovers
6:49whichever way you guys want to do it now - adding a little bit of death and drama
6:54I'm gonna get going in with this really dark dark blue shade in here and i'm
6:58actually going to touch this little duochrome moment right here i'm going to
7:01take the dark blue actually and do a little bit under my eyes as well let's
7:06do the crease first so I was taking a little mac 217 and that dark blue is so
7:12big and it like you really got to be careful so I'm going to be really
7:16delicate and start tucking that dark color a little bit in there
7:22this is for depth and drama if you want it a little lighter just skip this part
7:27but I'm gonna take that sugar pill brush one more time and just help blend and
7:31blend all right actually switched my idea so I did the darkness on here with
7:36my crease and then
7:38I'm like going to add even more color I think it's pretty good for now until we
7:42do lashes for the top i'm like okay i'm loving this
7:45it's very like alien cyborgs sky blue
7:49like I don't even know Titanic drowning sexy i don't know what the fuck I'm
7:54saying but you guys get the drift I'm loving it let's move to under my eyes
7:59okay so i was looking at all my makeup trying to find a good paint and of
8:03course I pull up more sugar bill this is the pro palette you can usually get
8:07these at like the imap makeup trade shows or that type of thing I don't
8:11think they sell them online
8:12but there's a pink in there right there and I'm like ooh girl
8:15so we're going to dip into that and i'm also going to do a little more inner
8:18corner under and I found this
8:21inglot pigment eyeshadow it is so pretty
8:24so i am going to give that a world today and i'm going to be using my little mac
8:29- 19 pointy brush
8:31I know what I don't normally use inglot a lot on my channel but i am obsessed
8:35with this pigment so once again we're going to let that brush a little bit and
8:40I like to just pour some of the pigment into the cap like so so I'm just going
8:44to take this and put it right at the inner corner
8:48oh my god and gagging this is so pretty
8:52this is the definition of like has to drop
8:55I'm being really delicate as usual and barely touching my skin
9:00imagine this is like a highlight on my cheek who I might have to do that like
9:05every day now and because I have OCD and glitter obsession
9:10I'm just going back over and over honestly I think one layers and
9:14but this is the jeffrey show here we're going to do like 16 layers
9:18all right now we're going to dip into that sugar Belle paint with the exact
9:21same brush let's keep it moving in and I'm just gonna continue to drag this out
9:28now this pink is very think so
9:31be careful we're just going to merge these two together and notice how i'm
9:35not going to go all the way because i am going to take that dark blue that we put
9:38in my crease the second ago and we are going to bring a little bit of that down
9:41so i'm not gonna do the entire thing
9:44oh my god that's like Pinker the papacy ok now the pink is laid down my cock in
9:50with this really really dark blue and i'm going to be using this little more
9:54the five of seven brush a little detailer what's up girl
9:58I love this little guy so we're just gonna really lightly start in there and
10:03I'm going to take the start
10:04blue and just merge it with that pink really thin
10:09like we want this under I to look like a cotton candy
10:13orgasm you want these eyeshadows to merge together so it should create a
10:17little kind of purple moment which is what happens with blue and pink get to
10:22get there
10:23hi color wheel all right now I'm not going to do a wing for this look but i
10:27am going to smudge a little black liner where the lashes are going to go i think
10:31there's so much color going on here
10:33it just needs a little bit of depth so I'm going to take my mac smolder pencil
10:36and I'm just gonna really lightly like we're talking barely there so I'm just
10:41going to kind of tight line in there
10:42so really minimal that is now obviously it's not so much yet somebody's my
10:46little more feet
10:47508 brush I love this and i'm just going to take that and smudge out that top
10:53liner just a hair
10:55all right now before we do mascara and latches
10:59i'm going to do some white eyeliner and you're like oh my god so more liner girl
11:03we are not done this is an intricate little look so we're going to take max
11:06fascinating white pencil this is my favorite for the waterline who are going
11:11to hold your breath and just get through this one real quick if you hit your
11:14waterline
11:15so we're going to take this pencil and we're just gonna put it right in the
11:19water line now because of all these bright colors you've got to be careful
11:22because this liner gonna hug on to color as well
11:25like take it and turn like pink so you've got to be really careful now I
11:30think this really completes the look
11:33it's like that extra subtlety all right now for lashes you definitely want to
11:38look like adults so we're going to first coat or latches with the new to face
11:42waterproof better than sex
11:44oh my god I told you guys I had been waiting to try this this is one of my
11:48favorite mascaras
11:49so let's see what happens a same amazing once before
11:54let's see how this works now I got so excited I blinked and got mascara under
12:01my eye so i'm just going to use a little primer to wipe it off camera i'll be
12:06back in two seconds
12:07all right i did my whole entire mascara off camera actually got it on my hair
12:12like a girl was having a moment when slow deep breath and I got too excited
12:17and got it all over myself so mascara is on now it's time for lashes
12:22we're going to do something really soft and wispy and natural haha just kidding
12:27we're going to go in with the new sugar pill eres lashes
12:30oh my god i saw these and I was like these were made for me
12:34let's put these babies on and just see what happens

13:24any contour which is so weird for me I'm like where's my cheekbones and other
13:30there

13:34know I'm over a very poor i am live thing for that packaging it's just so
13:40cute
13:41so basically the white part the highlight are inside the blush it's more
13:44subtle than it looks and smells like a lush bath bomb that is so crazy
13:48yummy okay so I'm gonna be using this chanel powder brush and it says just
13:52just swirl around

1:13amazing if you guys do not know what that surgery is about look at my
1:17instagram i talked about it and give you a whole spiel
1:20but a long story short I got a whole new hair line and it takes months for the
1:24hair to grow obviously full and long again so i'm gonna be pushing my hair
1:29color and every video so I hope you enjoy this blonde bombshell moment and
1:33keep watching
1:35let's get started so as you can see I've already done my foundation and contour
1:40and powder highlights so if you want to see how we do that
1:43go back to my channel and find the official jeffree star face routine video
1:48all right now to get this crazy neon smokiness i'm going to use the lightest
1:54shade from the Kat Von D shade + light eye palette i'm going to be using the
1:58best guy today and I'm just going to take my mac to 52 as always my go-to
2:06and we're going to take that white color coat the entire bristles and then you
2:13guys know what I'd love to do it take that highlight right under the brow and
2:19just start blending down now I know a lot of you left to prime i do prime my
2:26lids sometimes but since I've been doing makeup
2:29I always just take a light color and bring it all the way down so it's kind
2:33of my primer love to take the shadow and bring it all the way past the brows so
2:40all the way there
2:42once it hits my face tattoo I know I'm good
2:46who hey all right now let's start putting some neon colors on i'm going to
2:52go to one of my go-to favorites is that Urban Decay electric palette i love this
2:56one
2:57now it says that a few of the shades or not I save and a lot of you're probably
3:01like really read the unit carton on this it says that some of the shades are not
3:07I say
3:07meaning that there's some dyes that they used in their formula that may stay in
3:13the lids so I personally do not care i know my eyelids are not going to fall
3:16off and then I don't mind looking like i had pink eye for a few days because i
3:21just put foundation right over it so going to make a little cut crease type
3:24of moment with my eyes i'm going to be using the occ cosmetics color pencil in
3:31shade animate this is what I used for my pink browse and a few of my last videos
3:35so what this i'm actually going to sketch out my lid of where I'm gonna now
3:42draw it on
3:43so this is like an old-school trick I used to do back in the j
3:48so basically just sketching out where i'm going to draw and I like to bring
3:53the pencil all the way down in
3:56my water and bring it a little outside the line now this is obviously not
4:01supposed to look perfect such as like a little sketch that we're going to be a
4:04shadow on top of so don't think like damn bitch you look a messy so that's my
4:09little sketch
4:10q now i'm going to take this chanel eyeshadow blender sounds like really
4:14don't mean I'm gonna take some pink eyeshadow from this palette
4:19we're going to do shade savage which is this pink eye right here and I'm just
4:23going to coat the entire brush like so high by fall out
4:28we're actually going to take this brush and go over that line that i created and
4:33this is where you're going to buff it out and blends so force that line was
4:37definitely not perfect it was just more so to be a guide
4:42just guide me through this girl and I like to take this make it go all the way
4:46down the nose a little very airbrushed
4:49hello eighties makeup how are you and i'm just going to start buffing up
4:54so notice how i was doing little back and forth motions to give it that really
4:58nice
4:58airbrushed look that I have been known for forever
5:03we're just going to go up and up so just soft little brush motor like emotions
5:07and we're blending and blending and blending i'm going to take the shadow
5:11brush and dab it on my lid so it kind of creates that like halo half see type of
5:18moment and we're just going to go back and forth so this is like the foundation
5:22of the neon pink like she's getting there
5:25we're going to add in some more depth but this is just like the outline
5:28ok so then I'm going to take that first blending brush and without any extra
5:32product i'm just gonna kind of buff over the pink at the top edges just so it
5:37gives it a really nice
5:38blendy look before we go in with even more color
5:43all right now we're going to go in with this orange color is called a slow burn
5:48I and i love this one it really complements this one so I'm just going
5:52to dip it in and i'm gonna be using a little blending brush from Gucci i'm
5:56obsessed with these bristles they're so soft it feels like i don't know i don't
6:01even know what it feels like it just makes my eyelids come now these do have
6:05a little bit of fallout so high then we're just going to go in the middle now
6:09you don't have to necessarily do this perfect there's no like way to put on
6:14the orange I was kind of blending it in with the pink and dragging up
6:18unlike that outside so notice how the orange will not go in its just going to
6:22go on the outsides
6:24I want to give it some dimension and get my I some death
6:27so I'm just going to put that orange almost over the pink and it kind of
6:30creates a custom color and then drag it out even more since I we have no brows
6:35we can do whatever we want and just bring it all the way out
6:39love it so it's good it's kind of like a little sunset ombre moment and then if
6:43you want you can go back in with your first blending brush open up that cattle
6:49in G and take that light color one more time
6:52I just put a little bit on the brush and then we're going to go over that one
6:56more time and make sure it looks like I everything is airbrush now before i do
7:02all that smoky drama and make my eyes i am going to do a little wing and i'm
7:06gonna be using the kat von d liquid liner in trooper
7:10now I love this you just give it a little shake and the applicator is
7:13genius it's really fine and thin like hmm
7:17so I'm literally just going to take this and start painting and all that wing now
7:23I like to go from the middle and kind of create my shape and then I'll go down
7:28and start mapping it out but I love this pencil because it's a really cool way so
7:33if you were like on the go
7:35I have to go to business meeting and then you know to an orgy
7:38this one is definitely something you want to invest in
7:42now a lot of the times with liner i will take a mirror and get really close in
7:48there and just kind of go for it because sometimes the vanity mirrors are not
7:54good enough
7:56now what I'm doing this you guys
8:02I hope my breath so excuse the silence
8:11yes eyeliner
8:15let's get to smoking at the bottom and i don't mean crack cocaine
8:18I grabbed my trusting max smolder pencil and I'm just gonna slowly drag it in the
8:26water line now this liner is perfect for smudging if you want 24-hour stay liner
8:33this is not it this is for purposes of smudging out the bottom and making them
8:37look like heaven so we're just gonna put a little bit on the waterline you want
8:42to drive down too much because it might smear
8:46now for the bottom i'm going to take my mac - 19 pencil branch pipe n soul and
8:52I'm gonna take this shadow called urban it's this one is this hot purple like
8:56Omar growing i love this purple color
8:58so usually when you find a purple from any brand it's not good like it doesn't
9:02show up
9:03good enough but this one oh my god
9:06so I coat the entire brush like she's pigmented and I'm just gonna take this
9:11and start to drag it so i take the pencil brush and I start putting the
9:16shadow over that black and I'm really careful it's almost like we're doing
9:21surgery and I just start dragging it across
9:25now we're going to use another brush in a second but this like really gets it
9:29defined and it depends on how dramatic you want you can really bring it down
9:33like I am or you can share it down a little more it's up to you
9:37I'm always like go bold or go home
9:41then I'll take a little bit out with that wing and kind of mix in with the
9:44orange so we're like we're taking it there and then we're going to take the
9:48more feet 5 14 it's like a little detail brush and I'm going to dip it into that
9:52purple but i'm also going to take the next one called jilted right here and
9:58I'm just going to dab that on top of it so when i buffed out kind of gives it a
10:03little more depth a little more like
10:05oh hey and i'm just going to take it right over the purple and just slowly
10:09drag it across
10:11so this will soften all those harsh edges and just kind of give it a more
10:15defined luck
10:17just a little high-fashion Couture if you will now i'm just going back in one
10:21more time with the kat von d trooper liner
10:23I'm just kind of merging my corners of my eyes together so they look cohesive
10:29and like they're all one unit just tiny little details that I like to do and
10:35then I'm gonna take that urban decay jilted shade one more time with this
10:39morphe brush and just really smoke it out so it's like who lowered
10:45now what what is left with his eye
10:48besides lashes i think we are good i wasn't add some silver but i like the
10:54way that light shade is still on my lid i didn't really put another color there
11:00and i like that so i'm actually gonna go back in with that light shade right here
11:04and I'm just gonna add a little bit of it in here so it's like extra whoo
11:12hi good morning want to go in with my benefit roller lash
11:16I still can't get over this i got just I love it if you have tried this mascara
11:22let me know in the comments below if you love it i love this applicator
11:27it is perfect for top and bottom
11:31oh right come thru bottom mascara I think it's really important it's like to
11:36me
11:36hi such a big difference and this mascara really let's the bottoms like
11:41have a have their moment so we're just going to take it
11:44the nest it
11:45and then go out and under now if i don't like how my bottom ass girl looks
11:51I will brush a little calm through this is a little off
11:54morphy 22 mascara home and always going to calm it down because when you get
12:00ready
12:01every single day your lashes take like extreme abuse
12:05so I'm like Lou I am happy with how this is looking so let's put on our lashes
12:12now I want real real big draw but for these lashes today so i'm going to be
12:16using that new bounce some Russian black

12:22they're like double stacked on one strip
12:26it's like it's but it's it's special
12:30so it's going to take my glue that smells like lobster pacy and we're just
12:34gonna go with the entire lash band
12:39now whenever i'm going to hurry my lashes never want to stay on but today
12:48they're actually behaving
12:51which is shocking so right after I film today you guys I'm going to my makeup

13:29I'm going to be trying out this new Tom Ford soul a contour compact I love the
13:34biggest packaging is it reminds me of my highlighter it's almost bigger i think
13:38and i love this it comes with a highlight of blush and a browser

13:49out and I'm gonna use a little nervous kabuki brush and try a little bit of
13:53blush today

13:58a little bit of color to my cheeks i know i normally stay away from blush but
14:03I feel like with this look a little bit

14:38what i recommend this palette if you were like and makeup collector and you

1:14let's dive into this summer goodness
1:17now let's talk about skin care for a second i have tried to not age for about
1:2215 years now and I mean I can say I've done a pretty good job of trying to like
1:26just stay away from the central together so I don't know why people leave the
1:29house and it'll hold umbrellas over their head and they don't wear 20 layers
1:33of sunscreen but I'm not normal
1:35first to prep the skin a bit of using that Georgia or money
1:38maestro UV primer now the cool thing about this
1:41yes you can really read that SPF 50 and that is not a lie
1:46it really does have that so I like to shake this guy and as like a dropper and
1:50i'm just going to put some
1:51all over my fingers like how i was going to attach the dropper and you're just
1:55gonna blend it into your skin
1:58ok so we have our sunscreen on now of course what are we gonna do we're gonna
2:02do a little bit more primer and i'm gonna be using that girl and L ' so our
2:07I never know how to pronounce this and everyone tries to read me for it so this
2:11one does have real gold flakes in it
2:14we are going to be a little Civil BAM on the cheeks
2:19now wherever I hate my pores i'm really going to let that soak in and i'm going
2:23to drag it all around
2:26alright faces feeling snatch let's dive in the foundation what that are we gonna
2:31do it in y'all I'm feeling a little luminous silk foundation I mean it's
2:35summer hello
2:36we're going to shake that at and then i think i'm going to mix in this
2:39foundation that has SPF and this is by the mayor this is called the treatment
2:44fluid foundation and it's a little darker than my usual color so I like to
2:48mix it and just give me a little little added warmth the little summer glow
2:51little tan
2:53we're going to use the back of our hand just do a little one two three and then
2:56we're going to take that the mayor and we're going to do a little one too and
3:01that is enough to cover your entire face neck ears chest and mouth
3:05obviously you guys know I have my damp Beauty Blender on standby but i think
3:08i'm going to use our teeth brush and this is the oval-8 I'm just gonna
3:12there we go so I'm going to take that same brush and just kinda got this all
3:17around

8:43white eyeshadow this is from that busy art editorial palette i love this yes I
8:48actually draw this but thank God on the shadows crack
8:50i'm gonna be using a little mac 252 brush and we are really got a highlight
8:56under them around so we're just going to drag this out and just merge that in and
9:03look at that this is like a little full full drag proud today
9:08next step is really easy we're just going to take a little blending brush
9:12and another blending brush and we're just going to jump into the lonely
9:16violet vice palette now this has really great neutrals i love the look that
9:23we're going to recreate i basically had like a transition color coming all the
9:28way in here cutting out my crease and I left that blank and a really bright neon
9:33liner so we're just going to take a Toby color and we're going to take it all the
9:37way and cut out that lid and then we're going to leave this all blank for that
9:41neon liner to have its a moment so i'm going to be dipping into a ragamuffin
9:45right here and
9:46and we're just going to talk this right in here
9:54take this color little more and then we're just gonna talk it and put a
9:57little bit on that lid just what kind of all flows together so i am going to
10:01blend this out of course we are not leaving it like that but i'm just going
10:04to sketch it out on the other side as well and then we'll get your buffing and
10:07blending and now we're going to take this lighter shade called mama bird
10:11we're just going to dip into that and then we are going to blend out
10:16then make this look really airbrushed
10:22and then I'm going to get back into that white eyeshadow with the first brush and
10:27I'm just gonna talk that white right in there so it really cuts that out
10:31like I come back and we're just going to leave that blank and then the same thing
10:35for the top we're just going to go over and make sure it looks really blended
10:40all right now let's get to the neon liner last time i use this hot yellow
10:45which looks so stunning
10:46this one is called dance party and I think it's sold out like immediately
10:50you guys were like hi I knew that Joe is the hot green what some call this one is
10:54called fanny pack
10:55hi really cute so these are water activated now
10:59last time i use this really really tiny brush this is the 202 liner brush from
11:04Smith cosmetics love this guy
11:06and this is water activated i'm just going to take a tiny little bit of water
11:11from this a high
11:13no one's tried is planted before you got the wrong one I feel like a super bowl
11:16commercial but this is just my favorite water
11:18I'm just going for a little bit in this camp
11:22now we're going to take that liner and we're just going to move it around
11:26huh oh so pretty i want to scream so I poured out some of the water
11:32now i'm just going to kind of move it around and then it gets really pigment
11:35did
11:36so you're just gonna want to take the liner brush and oh my god
11:42all right now I'm going to bring this up a little bit and just kind of put it
11:46over our shadow
11:48all right the liner is done and he's also come in a lot of other shades so I
11:52can't wait to get more and it was like a hot blue
11:55there's like a pink and we also have like black silver and other cool colors
11:58so definitely be getting a million of these is going to like my new stable
12:02color I'm like oh what is next mascara and you're probably like what is that it
12:08that's all I did the other day now you can take something in the water line if
12:11you want to add a little pop for mascara today I'm gonna be taking the iconic
12:14mascara from Gucci this is my new favorite i love the brush on this guy is
12:19so easy to work with and we're just going to coat our entire bottoms and top
12:30all right now for lips today I'm going to prep them with some lip scrub this is
12:34my own of a lower lip scrub in flavor spearmint and I like to just take some
12:38of my fingers and just go to town
12:42alright lips are smooth and already
12:46now today i'm going to be using my own the lower liquid lipsticks in shade or
12:50water melon soda and we're going to dab a little bit of a nude beach in the
12:53center for some extra dimension
12:58of course I'm going to leave a little bit in the center for a nude beach
13:01so I'm not going to fill it in all the way
13:04and now we're going to take a little bit of a nude beach and we're just going to
13:10press it right here and then we're going to take a little more key eyeshadow
13:15brush and we're just going to blend this in I love how this looks now of course
13:23if you want you can do a . in the center on your top left
13:27I kind of like to just leave it on the bottom so it gives my lips that extra
13:30like alright guys so this look is pretty much done you really don't need anything
13:35else of course if you want to add on more highlight because you have a really
13:38bad crazy obsession with highlighters
13:42you can always dip in and you know do a little bump it's been you know probably
13:45like 20 minutes since we put on you know the highlighter so of course if you want
13:49to read you more
13:51of course you can but besides that I think we're gonna need a little bit of
13:54setting spray
13:55ok so it since it is summer we're going to bring out our touch at dewy skin
13:59missed and we're just gonna shake and Shake and I wish nathan is here to help
14:04me with three more setting sprays but let's get our engines ready and let's
14:08get to spraying all right
14:13this look is complete alright guys this look is done it is probably one of my
14:20quickest looks I think taking away
14:22false lashes and tons of eyeshadow obviously saves you a lot of time so of
14:27course if you want to tailor this look do some black wings some silver some
14:31gold and yellow any color will work i think it's summer it's fun
14:35I mean I don't even care if it's Christmastime I just want to wear bright
14:38colors all the time and for lips could really swap this out with anything if
14:42you're afraid of bright colors just us straight up nude and you're still going
14:46to select or just do some light gloss and call it a day
14:49now one last tidbit i will have four new skin frost high lighter shades coming up

5:15what happens is bringing into my eyebrow bone structure
5:19i'm also going to bring the shadow down so it caps off mine own
5:24now i'm going to take the Beauty Blender again and just lightly about this
5:33all right now i'm going to do my signature Toby Brown eyebrows off camera
5:37if you want to see how i draw them on go through my channel and find my previous
5:41face routine video and I'll be right back
5:44all right let's get started on the eyes now i'm going to be using a light shadow
5:49from brow all the way to live as I normally do today i'm going to be using
5:53the tartlet palette and i love this shade right here called Super Mom
6:01so let's dip into that one and i'm going to be using my trusty Mac 252 brush as
6:06always
6:07now I love to pack this in so don't just swipe it around your eyes like really
6:11pack in that color
6:13now since i'm going to be doing my whole entire lid covered in rainbow glitter
6:22I definitely need a transition color so i'm going to be using the melt cosmetics
6:28Dark Matter stack and this first color I die it's called blur and i'm just going
6:35to be placing that in my crews and i'm gonna be using a mac
6:39- - for blending brush and we're just going to dip into this one and I'm just
6:45going to kind of create or around my I just really get into that crease
6:50now I don't want it too dark so I'm just going to lightly blend avoiding my lid
6:55area and i'm going to bring that down just wear my contour ended before and it
7:02was dragging it out past my
7:04i know i do you want to add a little bit more depth into that crease so i'm going
7:10to be taking the color right below it which is called unseen and i'm just
7:16going to do a little bit more more towards the middle so I have more of a
7:21depth and you know more definition come through transition color
7:26okay i'm going to put it a little bit on my lid right by the lash line but just
7:31on the outer corner
7:33all right now before I coat my entire lid with glitter I do need to color to
7:38put down before that and i'm going to be using this purple metal crush eyeshadow
7:44from kat von d this color is called danzig and it's so pretty
7:48I'm going to dip my morphe 433 eyeshadow brush in this completely I want it to be
7:55coded as does not have to be perfect this is just more so
7:59so the glitter has something to be on top of now what I really like about
8:05these eyeshadows is if you wet them which i'm going to take this mac fix+
8:09the shadows go on really crazy metallic and I was going to tuck that in my lid
8:18now i'm noticing that there's some fallout so to save myself from screaming
8:23later let's apply some Chanel loose powder under my eyes to catch that ball
8:29out which we will brush out later
8:32this part is not have to be perfect now if you've never baked before
8:37just type in baking makeup and you'll find a million things
8:42all right we're going to buff that out in a minute after i'm done with my eyes
8:45and will make all this bull and seamlessly
8:47all right now let's go back with the dance big purple eyeshadow and lets
8:51blend
8:53it out now i'm going to take this all the way in to my socket and drag it down
8:58just a tiny their bold on a look at that shine
9:03now that the purple is laid down i'm going to be taking another mac - 24 and
9:08I'm going to dip into that purple really lightly
9:11knock off the fall out and i'm going to go in and just start blending the purple
9:16up a little bit still looks a little softer and not so harsh
9:20nothing crazy just soft blend and you want to keep it harsh in here so I'm not
9:26gonna buff that out too much
9:28all right now I'm going to take the mac 135 brush and I'm just going to dust off
9:31that fallout with powder
9:34I found this old graftobian makeup liquids park alert now this literally is
9:40like liquid glitter
9:42it doesn't show up opaque enough for me but it's definitely a good base and i'm
9:47just going to take this and paint it
9:49oh hi sparkles over my lid now before it dries i'm going to take a sigma e 5 7
9:56flat brush and I'm just going to take some of this glitter and press it onto
10:02the brush

10:30this on my waterline before i do any more litter shadows because I want my
10:34eyes - oh alright i really want more glitter on my eyes and I'm going to be
10:39layering a pigment down below I found this color pop eyeshadow it's called a
10:45visa it's like turquoise glitter would be going in with this Tom Ford 14
10:49eyeshadow brush and I'm just gonna chip in there
10:53lightly put it under that white color and right on that purple so they merge
11:00together
11:01see them kissing and making out right there and I was checking a Beauty
11:04Blender and I'm kind of softening the edges a little more
11:09all right now for the center of my lid I'm going to really coat it with glitter
11:14I'm gonna go back in with that graftobian glitter glam
11:18yeah
11:18and i'm going to leave some of the turquoise showing so we can have a
11:21little moment but i'm going to cover most of it
11:24I'm going to go in with this mac 3d glitter in lavender and go back with the
11:29same sigma brush
11:31now this is like a more refined version of that pic glitter we just used and I'm

0:49matte palette this is the 01 basic so great so I'm just going to take this
0:54really light color is the lightest one of the palette and i am going to pack
1:01that under my brow
1:03now when we get closer to the lid i'm going to be using the second lightest
1:07nude shade and then bringing it all the way down to basically my lash line
1:14so a lot of people like to use primers this is basically my primer and we're
1:19going to bring it all the way to tell the brow and a little past

1:45pack on a lot of pigment and i'm just going to take this color and i'm going
1:50to start blending it in the corners of my eye and I'm going to bring it down
1:58like thirty percent for my eye so not in the middle but thirty percent you know
2:08i'm going to take this same color and bring it to the top case with any
2:13fallout it's going to lightly brushed away
2:16we have what i like to call the base of the look down
2:20now i'm just going to jump right into it and take this bright blue eyeshadow
2:24called after party from sugarpill i'm going to be blending out the blue with a
2:30really light blue from honest hacia called I see now for this look I'm going
2:35to be using a lot of different eye brushes
2:37we got a lot going on here so i will be starting with the morphe 441 brush and
2:42I'm going to be packing it on with this chanel rush number 19 and then i'm going
2:47to be blending it out a little bit with this Gucci brush the blending number 20
2:53see what happens
3:02all right now i'm going to be taking a map 224 brush and I'm going to be
3:12blending the sugar pill blue with the honest top see i see both on my brush
3:18so I getting nice soft then now you may notice that I blow a lot of the brushes
3:25if I was doing someone elses makeup blowing is prohibited unless they're
3:29paying you extra
3:30but for real i would only blow on my brushes because they are mine and i can
3:35and it is to avoid a lot of fallout because i have all of this pretty
3:39foundation on
3:40so if you see me going that's exactly what i'm doing i am blowing cool
3:45now i'm going to take I see shadow by itself and just kind of these edges
4:04now i'm going to take this on the stops to get shadow in Star cobalt and I'm
4:10going to pack it on a little bit on my lid with some definition and we're just
4:23packing
4:27all right now we're going to go back to our blending brush take a little bit
4:33more of that light light blue bristles and we're just going to go over the dark
4:38- they all come together like besties
4:42there we go now before i do the under I'm a little bit more of that
4:47thunderstruck I shout out on top
4:51so we get a nice glow we blend lose
4:56now we're going to move under the eyes now i'm just taking that same more a
5:01blender and I didn't dip into the eye shadow again this is left over so there
5:07is minimal fallout and I'm just gonna start blending the blue into this white
5:14gold shadow
5:16I try to do is minimal of the cane and so there is not a lot of shadow falling
5:20all over you
5:25now before I do anything else
5:29i'm going to add some white liner into my waterline whenever I do
5:33bright colors I love to add white because it really makes it pop
5:37you looked very artificial if we will and very dull like this is max quite
5:41fascinating liner
5:43I'm just going to pull my skin down ever so gently and I'm going to pack this in
5:49now I love white liner i've been using it since the nineties
5:54it is just my go-to it opened the I writings very different
6:00it's a cool effect when you see me go back and forth a lot
6:04not because the product isn't good but i like to really pack it in there so it is

6:31than sex
6:32by Too Faced i love the bristles they are perfect for my eyes now
6:38this application is not be perfect since we are going to cover them
6:42I just don't like when people put on lashes without any mascara and you can
6:46see there real human hair showing through or it's just not the same color
6:51our lashes will never be this black
6:54hence why there is mascara so let's coat views thoroughly
7:02all right now and I do lashes i like to take the strip off and of course i like
7:09to measure them to my eyes
7:10so not everyone has crazy big lids fit these lashes so I've already pre-trimmed
7:15mine a little bit with a little bit of nail scissors

12:43let's get to blinding
12:50and you know we have to do the Cupid's bow oh come on keep it though I want to
12:55be looking like I just drink a tall cold glass of metal milk and then you know it
13:00wouldn't be right unless we got that little tip of her nose

14:41like okay I want to go back to a normal regular stick lipstick for a change I
14:45love this has a little bit of Sheen to it but it is very full coverage and I
14:51think it looks flawless so I think the only thing that's stopping me from

2:46light palette and I like to mix these two shades on the left
2:50BAM and height that is my fingernail and gouging out the pan
2:54who hates when you fuck up your pan we're going to be taking this side first
2:59very skinny and we're just going to be dipping into this once
3:03literally one there's a lot of pigment the closer you put the two lines
3:08together to create that shadow
3:10the more pinched your nose is going to be so i am going to really bring mine in
3:15it's crazy what makeup can do look at how crazy and big it looks on the end
3:19now because I haven't finished it
3:20come on illusions yes
3:23now we're going to take the fluffy side and this has no product on it and I'm
3:27just gonna blend and buff it out a little bit not being really soft with my
3:31pressure so it just looks effortless and then i'm going to start to drag it down
3:36a little this way and then I'm gonna take some darkness and learn that up on
3:40the nostrils come on nostrils
3:42how's your day and then with the damp Beauty Blender i'm just going to lightly
3:46go over those edges where they're a little more dark at the top
3:50all right now to make sure this nose days snatch
3:54I'm going to be dipping in with a little bit of cat cosmetics go i hit pan on
3:57this the other day I am upset so I definitely need a new one
4:00this is a invisible setting powder and i love it
4:05really good to stay under the eyes if you have any problems with creasing the
4:08nose is set now to recreate that extreme highlight from that drug store look I'm
4:13going to be pulling out my sleek makeup now to this brand it is so good these
4:18highlighters are extreme i use this in my rolls-royce video as well and
4:22everyone was like do invention blinding us a on Aon do so I'm never taking my
4:28morphe m510 or the 510 as we call it on the streets for this one this is the one
4:34you guys I'm going to be taking of this shade
4:37this shade of this palette has three patterns and one cream and when I talked
4:40about before I said the wrong thing
4:42oops i'm clocking myself so these two I love mixing so I'm just going to start
4:46out by mm that's all you need you guys because this is dead
4:49Lee now i'm just going to take us on the high plains of my cheekbones and I'm not
4:53going to bring it down as low as i normally do because i want to look
4:58really high and elevated like a lavender glasses on my cheeks
5:02all right now it's time for the Cupid's bow so let's just dust on there
5:06I like to look like I was drinking a glass of silver surfers come
5:09so I'm just gonna you know really intensify that lip and because i'm not
5:13going to my lipstick for a minute was gonna just someone here because my
5:16bottom lip is like now
5:19the nose was really important so I'm just going to take one little finger
5:23swipe that's all you need
5:24and it was gonna rub it on the end
5:27and we're just gonna dust that and
5:29and go so it's like really really really extreme now
5:34sometimes I'll go back in with that you know it's contour just kind of clean up
5:38a little bit nach gods
5:40now let's go on to these eyes for the highlight under the brow all the way to
5:44the lid color
5:45we're gonna be dipping into my particular palette now this sold out so
5:49quickly when it launched a few weeks ago I was like jesus take the wheel
5:54so now my site is officially restock so if you want to dip into this madness all
5:58summer long
5:59give it a try i'm gonna be using this amazing like bone ivory color this is
6:03called China white and i'm just using a little flat synthetic brush
6:07let's go to blending now if you get that really dark smoky eye is actually way
6:15easier than you think i'm just going to be using this mac paint pot this is from
6:19the pro collection it's called black ground
6:22it is really dope so basically just going to coat my entire lives with this
6:25and then you shadow to buff and blend and make it really smoky so it's really
6:30not hard and its really don't fall out with this which is amazing
6:33so I'm gonna be using this ocean l blender synthetic brush and we're just
6:36going to dip right in
6:37hi it works quickly now it depends on where you want it i like to have mine
6:42all the way and
6:43then we'll put some highlight on the outside so i'm just going to start by
6:46coating my entire lid
6:49now this has so much pigment and this brush is just going to help me get it
6:53blend it out a little bit so i am going to stop it right here and then I'm gonna
6:58drag it down and i'll probably keep it just like that and then you gotta drag
7:04it in
7:05and of course we'll use a lot more big man let me dip into my pot and that's it
7:11you're just going to coat all the way over now of course if you don't like it
7:15all the way in the inner corner you can scale it back this is just what I prefer
7:19and then I'd like to drag it out this way
7:23and that's it now this part does not look pretty so you're like a hook in
7:26morning panda

1:04send me the pictures girl like I want to see what you guys be doing go outside
1:07your comfort zone do something they'll enjoy watching this
1:10what I'm gonna start this look by using my busy art basic matte eyeshadow
1:15palette and I'm going to be picking the lightest shade and i'm just going to be
1:19placing that right under my brow and bring it all the way down to the lash
1:24line
1:25now i've been using this mac 252 brush for like 10 years
1:30so I just stick to this one and love it really easy to blend
1:38now i'm going to do a black winged liner today but before I do that I'm going to
1:44add some soft camel eyeshadow below just to give it that really dramatic look
1:51i'm gonna be using this bobby brown eyeshadow and the shape is called camel
1:55this is the morphe 514
1:58i have about 16 of these on my makeup station
2:01my eyes are deep set I'm gonna be taking the shadow and almost bringing it down
2:05to where the contour my nose is and over my lid and slightly out so it will match
2:12the black winged liner and about to do and just going to drag it out for the
2:22brow and and we would do that later
2:26all right now that the other side matches perfectly
2:29I'm going to go in with him actually for blending brush and I'm going to take the
2:33same
2:34Bobby around I shout out and just start popping it up and outwards
2:40now i'm gonna be really delicate so this looks really soft
2:44all right now to soften those edges on the top i'm gonna go back in with that
2:49light shade and just start blending and blending just so they look really nice
2:56and smooth and not too harsh
2:58I'm going to take some shadow and put it more method can carve out that Brown
3:05all right look at our wing all right now for the black-winged i'm gonna be using
3:10the Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper and i'm going to be using that chart
3:14black clay liner
3:16I love the stuff that you do not come off so i'm going to do the base with
3:20this and then fill in with the chart
3:24now when I do like to hold my breath so the line is precise
3:28so let's have a moment of silence for the liner
3:34yeah
3:42now that I got my shape down i'm going to be using this mac 263 brush to
3:48filling threat to my liner
3:50now if you want to your whole I with the letter you can i love you use gel liners
3:55because it really make sure the wing is not robot for him off later
3:59who knows we're going to be doing if you're at the mall at the grocery store
4:01doing papi
4:03you definitely do not want your wing to come up okay all right now that our
4:11liner is on fleet and can cut a bitch we are going to add some glitter on top of
4:15the liner
4:16now my favorite liquor brand which i have used before is lit cosmetics
4:20I love these you guys this shade is called soul sister it is like a
4:25chameleon is crawling on my liner
4:28it's like green yellow it looks like an oil slick when you put it over black so
4:33I'm gonna be using the lit liquid glitter base and I'm just gonna dunk it
4:38in here and i'm going to paint it over
4:42hot now let's add some glitter
4:46oh hello liner and all i'm doing is adding it on very carefully
4:50all right
4:53both sides are done let me just sweep away some fallout and we are good to go
4:59for two latches i'm going to really smoke out my under eye with a metallic
5:03green and i'm going to add in some liner so as always i'm gonna go back to my Mac
5:07smoldering eye pencil and i'm going to put that in the water line and then
5:10we're gonna smoke it out with some crazy greens and as always you guys
5:14this does not have to be perfect because we are going to use it to smudge how i
5:18am going to take the black all the way and connected with the wing
5:22cool it to smoking all right so I'm gonna be using this kat von d metal
5:26crash eyeshadow in shape ke if you guys have never tried this before
5:30you're missing out because the pigment on these is out of this world now you
5:34can use this wet or dry i mean is it dry first to smoke out and then we can see
5:39what's gonna happen girl crushes the trial so faded at this is the 210 and
5:44i'm going to start smudging it over the black liner and just bringing it down
5:49really like pc have a follow-up we're going to go back and just brush off
5:58quickly
6:00all right now I'm going to go in with a another morphy 514 brush and we're gonna
6:04dip it into the same green eye shadow and we're just going to go over what we
6:09just did and make it even more smoky and dramatic this green is everything well
6:15now I like to do a little more black
6:19so I'm gonna take a black eye shadow and smudge it out a little bit more
6:24no I just a black I lied to be a dark gray color and I'm gonna use the same
6:29brush that had the green on it and we're just going to lightly get in there and
6:33i'm just going to take that fullness in the lash line and just starts smoking it
6:38out
6:39bloom or it may seem subtle to you guys but it actually makes a big different
6:45now before i do my lashes i'm going to use some mascara
6:49now i'm gonna try this benefit roller lash today's packaging so cute
6:53so let's see how it is now this one is very different for me you guys know I
6:56like a really big dick that one
6:59wait a minute and never used this before

7:26be using flutter lashes in style
7:28Leila these are big and dramatic
7:32so clearly i need to be using them as always i'm going to use my two of you
7:36can lash glue these lashes are very dramatic so I'm just going to try to get
7:41them to close to my lash line as possible so that glitter is not it
7:45and I like to take my real lashes and the false one and kind of mesh them to
7:50get their latches are done
7:52let's get to highlighting for highlighting today i'm going to be using

6:30start on them cheekbones and it's like okay so how severely do I want to cut
6:34you today because I'm feeling really severe know I always like to drag it on
6:38my temples
6:40I'd like to go really fast back and forth and it just kind of blend into
6:47that jawline and i'm going to drag it out just halfway so I'm never gonna go
6:50past it i'm just going to stop here and feather out and then a quick little
6:55trick I like to do with the nose is all just take a big fan brush this was from
6:58making forever and I'd into the pan once or twice
7:01get a little bit of product on there and always take it i'll go directly down

7:34all right i am feeling leaky now
7:37off camera i'm going to go draw in some browsers really quickly and i'll be
7:40right back all right now let's get started on these eyes to create that
7:45copper smoky drama i'm going to be using my Urban Decay eye primer and I'm just
7:50gonna do low one to swipe
7:53now notice I did do a different color on my eyebrows today it's a little more
7:56auburn color matches the pink and I might be blonder than this video but for
8:01now I love
8:02I'm just loving the brows I was taking a little flat synthetic brush and we are
8:06going to blend that primer into the lids now to start
8:12I'm going to be dipping into my own brands palette this is the beauty killer
8:16eyeshadow palette and I'm going to be using you two shades today
8:19first one I'm going to be using is China white and I'm going to take the same
8:22brush and I was gonna do my brow bone
8:26and highlight that now this is a very natural light ivory color so I'm just
8:32going to press that into the skin and then dragged down
8:38this is going to help my shadows blend later and just gives a pretty little
8:42highlight now we're going to take a little mac 224 brush and we're going to
8:47dip into a little transition shade called Kourtney and we're just going to
8:51put that right in our crease
8:55all right now notice how i am just kind of dragging this out a little bit right
9:02here just to give that I little illusion so now that this is done being blended
9:07we are going to add a little darkness in here with some copper shades
9:12now before I do anything else I'm going to go back into Kourtney and just do a
9:16little on my lids and
9:19there we go now to create that really dark copper moment i'm going to be using
9:22on stocks at beverly hills CNN
9:25oh come on first of all the pigments amazing so I'm really gonna darken my
9:29lid and start to blend that color out now everyone wanted to know what I was
9:35wearing on my lids the other day for that really wet metallic look so before
9:39we dive into that i am going to leave a space right in here to put that where I
9:43really don't need to put eyeshadow and then for a little touch of little more
9:48copper - I mean we need more warped to this space we're going to be using
9:51Anasazi as a blazing eyeshadow as well it's a little more rather than sienna
9:56and I'm just gonna put that in here as well
10:00we're just mixing matching today people
10:07now that this is blended into perfection of using the steel and magnificent
10:11metals now this is what gets that wet effect on your lids and this is shade
10:16king
10:16now it comes with these little dropper things you could mix to make it like a
10:20really crazy
10:20I'm going to be really country and to show you what I do yes I just like my
10:25own brush because i am putting it on myself
10:27do not ever like a brush and then put on our clients eyes but if you're doing on
10:30yourself
10:31who the fuck cares so I'm just going to take a little bit of this on the bridge
10:34soul you see how what'd that looks using this dry
10:36it's all right wedding a tiny bit I mean do you fucking say that
10:40whoa this is the definition of bullying bullying
10:44so the product is a little tacky you do have to move it around with the brush
10:49and then I'm just going to drag it down and fill in that blank space that we
10:54talked about earlier that we did not need any shadow for and then we're going
10:57to take a little bit more and here as well start to kind of get it out
11:00and there you have it come on now
11:05now they have these in like like 30 shades just like looking at on my lid i
11:09want to scream
11:10i am going to add a tiny bit of a liner now usually when i say tiny I do full
11:14fucking drag
11:15not today to face has these new eyeliner pens out called sketch markers and
11:21and i'm going to use this brown one this is called deep espresso
11:25this is like a brown black like this cute little packaging
11:28I love it's like now this is one of the felt tips and you do need to shake it
11:33for a second there are 1 million colors which I thought was amazing know what is
11:37this a inspired by Japanese calligraphy pens flexible felt tip allows you to
11:42create a paintbrush like stroke for clean mines
11:46all right well I'm just gonna dive right in here and just drag it on the lash
11:51line so our lashes look very pretty later
11:54I'm going to do the tiniest little wing and shock you all
11:57all right now to smoke out that bottom lash line and get that really deep
12:03copper fact i'm going to start out with my Mac some older I pencil and we're
12:09just going to quickly do the entire water line now we're going to smoke out
12:16that bottom lash line and he's on it stops at beverly hills shadow in henna
12:21now this one is like a deep copper and it has a lot of bling to it
12:24so I'm gonna actually use the liner to help me deep in and kind of create a
12:31more smoky look and I was going to start here with the pencil brush and just
12:35lightly really lightly almost like we're doing surgery go under the black liner
12:41now to avoid any fallout
12:44you're just going to be really gentle and go all the way across
12:49now I like to take the brush and kind of drag some of that black liner down and
12:54just kind of mix it in
12:55i love how this is looking
13:00I'm just gonna deep in this a little more make it a little more pop in and we
13:06should be good now i just bought this new Gucci mascara
