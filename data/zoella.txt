0:06nobody today i'm gonna be showing you how i did this gold I a bold step or red
0:11lip look for the festive season I'm sure there are some of you that have a few
0:15parties to go to
0:16or you just want to know yourself up on christmas day and have a little going it
0:21also you can use this for any time of year so if you're watching this in
0:24February 2016
0:26hi enjoy the video
0:29first thing I need to do is get this mop off my face
0:32so I'm going to put my hair up I've already primed and moisturize my face
0:38so the first thing I'm going to do is to use my foundation to get a kind of more
0:42even base
0:43my skin is not actually as bad as it has been
0:47um definitely improving I've noticed that drinking a lot more water has
0:50helped under and under and around my eyes as well
0:53the foundation i'm going to actually mix together because this is a teeny bit too
0:58dark
0:58this is not as mont blanc and i'm also going to mix it with a bit of Rimmel
1:02wake me up in the shade like porcelain
1:05I'm mostly just to kind of even out the color but also because i want a kind of
1:11jewy look I want to look like a fresh face very kind of healthy and a bit
1:16glowy because it is that time of year where you can go a bit more on board on
1:20the highlight
1:21I think personally and this does that but I don't want to do it too much it's
1:26more of a kind of us summary more of a summary foundation but i'm going to mix
1:31the two together to create kind of the perfect festive foundation concoction
1:37ok base is done I actually look quite pale I think you might be these lights
1:42not sure it's a good we got bronzer and as you can see it is quite and kind of
1:47jewy and quite like highlight e so if you have really again and you don't like
1:53that then I would avoid this but i wanted to go through that
1:57today I'm going to use the charlotte tilbury many miracle I want a dynamic
2:04duo list and and i'm just going to use a tiny bit of that just under my eyes to
2:10cancel out any homes and then going to use this end of sponge and just tap that
2:15in very very gently
2:16i'm also going to put a little bit of the collection lasting perfection
2:22concealer on the back of my hand so I can get my little spots and also
2:29underneath my eyes using the sponge again
2:33wrapping it up I love this concealer because i feel like it really your
2:40connection don't really have any big old spots right now but I've got a feeling
2:47old blemishes
2:48from where I have had them so I'm just covering those up to get more next thing
2:53I'm going to do is powder i'm using the Rimmel stay matte powder in transparent
2:59and i'm also using a real techniques bold metals brush in 100
3:04okay there we go so i have the kind of plain base sorted now I'm going to add a
3:10bit of color and a little bit more depth to my face
3:13i'm going to use one of these and this is a trustee contour stick and i'm going
3:21to take this and I'm going to go underneath my cheek bone in a line going
3:25to look absolutely terrifying but just trust me on this one
3:28also how cute is this packaging thank you is that ok
3:33cute the arms up I'm now going to use this teeny tiny little one
3:37this is actually for contour so this is for doing this because you can either
3:42use the bigger and or you can use a slightly more pointed end and i'm just
3:45going to kind of blend that out
3:47so as you can see you kind of got these little shadows now I quite liked doing
3:55it like that because i find you could be quite precise with it and it blends
3:59really nice and it doesn't quite natural and i am going to go over it just a
4:02little bit with the benefit hoola bronzer and that kind of also set
4:07because it's a cream product then you just want to take the bronze that any
4:10where the Sun would naturally hit
4:13and I sometimes take along my jawline to publish i'm going to use the AL glass
4:17ambient lighting palette
4:19looks like the earth and i'm going to go for this really pretty pink highlighter
4:26shade here in the middle just using the same brush this is a maestro one . now
4:33because i wanted to do glowy and highlight e
4:37I've opted for the mac mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle which I
4:41feel like if you want to go all out
4:43cheekbones this is the perfect product because it is a very very shimmery and
4:50it
4:50it's very perfectly but i'm just not taking it into my temples and dispersing
4:58it basically
5:00oh I forgot to put some lip boy alone i'm using the Clarins instant light lit
5:04up for oil and i'm just going to put that on before i put on my red lipstick
5:08just to give my lips a little bit of moisture next thing I'm going to do is
5:11put an eye base on my eyelids
5:14i'm using the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion antiaging they do say your
5:20eyes are the first thing the age all those laughter lines now while that is
5:24settling onto my eyelids i'm going to go on and do my eyebrows
5:28so for this I use a mac eyeshadow and it is this one which i think is charcoal
5:35brown and and I'm then using a mac 266 angled brush
5:40I just find that angle brush is a lot more precise and I feel like I fill
5:46those in quite quickly
5:47you don't have any of you have noticed but I've been trying to grow my eyebrows
5:51out a little bit and it has been quite a challenge
5:56there's just little parts of my eyebrows that won't grow as you can see on this
6:01side
6:02I've got a little gap here on this side of got quiet out here so I'm having to
6:06just fill those in so it looks a bit more England
6:09I do always tell people my one bit of beauty advice is to not do your eyebrows
6:13yourself is to always go to somebody and have them done professionally because i
6:18find that they know what they're doing a lot more than I do but also they can
6:24advise you on how to grow them or how best to fill them in to suit your face
6:29shape and and it's honestly just the best thing I've ever done i wish i had
6:34done it when I was younger so then I wouldn't be having to try and grow more
6:38in a 25 year old and I was a serious overclocker when i was younger i
6:46probably need to go slightly dark and naturally on the eyeshadow powder but
6:50because I've lightened my hair recently like quite a lot I go for somewhere in
6:56between
6:56ok so now I look crazy with the eyebrows i guess that during my eyes everything
7:00kind of merges in a little bit more
7:02I want to go for a really kind of subtle smokey gold I because I feel like that
7:07goes really well with a classic red lip and i don't know i just i like it so so
7:13for the base color I'm going to pop a little bit of this on and this is the
7:17colour-pop cream gel color in
7:20show me it's very beautiful you can do this with your fingers but i'm going to
7:24apply a little bit of that on a sigma short shader brush
7:28ok so now we roughly got this color on the eyes I've zoomed in a little i'm
7:32going to put a little bit of urban decay's dirty suite which is this one
7:39over my entire eyelid
7:41and then going to take this little brush again and walk that in there and go just
7:49underneath
7:52ok now with a sigma blending brush I'm going to go in the crease with the same
7:59color that I used my eyebrows which is Mac chocolate brown
8:03i'm going to just blend blend blend and then going to take a little bit of the
8:06same color and just join that into the middle of the lower lash line where I
8:11put the gold and then using a tapered blending brush by Sigma i am going to
8:17lend that a little bit more and then add a little bit of highlight and my brow
8:21bone and highlight i am using Mac's nylon my lord i always try and be so
8:30professional in these videos when we all know I don't know what I'm doing
8:35I'm just fluking this case that eyes almost done the only thing i'm going to
8:40do now is add a little bit of mascara i'm not going to do any liner on this
8:44one because i feel like the lips is kind of more of a statement the mascara i am
8:49using is the Maybelline lash sensational i always forget what this is called even
8:55though it's like my favorite thing ever
8:58at this stage you could also add some false eyelashes or performance Cara
9:02whichever way you like to do it but my lashes are actually quite long and curly
9:05so I really struggle with lashes and I don't really feel like I need to add
9:09anymore to them for this look
9:12however a few individual lashes my look quite nice but let's be honest I'm
9:15rubbish at lashes
9:16unless I've got time here to do them for me they always look crap though I'm just
9:21gonna go for just mascara for this lip
9:24ok it's time to do the lips ok so the oil is pretty much ripped off this look
9:29I wanted to use quite a bright cherry red because I feel like that's quite
9:33festive and so I'm going to use a color pop lip liner this is in the shade
9:39days it's slightly darker than the actual color but i wanted to do it that
9:44way
9:45these are kind of like liquid lipstick they're amazing and the pigmentation is
9:48so intense and they're really long-lasting which is why I thought it
9:51would be really good for like night out makeup and so I've gone for the
9:56colour-pop ultra matte lip in the shade
9:58succulent I'm just gonna give that a moment to dry
10:03ok so you can either leave it like this and it's quite maps and it looks
10:08I think very very pretty see sometimes I like a shimmery kind of lip gloss lip
10:12and sometimes I love a matte lip and I think this color looks amazing as a map
10:17but i'm thinking of putting a bit of red lip gloss on top so i'm using tiny birds
10:23lip gloss in the color
10:24Aphrodite very gorgeous there we go you have the perfect red lip for christmas i
10:31just realized i don't think i've ever done a red lip look on my channel before

0:00hello everyone today I wanted to do a video around the theme of valentine's
0:03day whether you love it or you hate it
0:06whether you're single and loving the single life of feeling super independent
0:10and don't need no one
0:11or I don't know why we don't get our or you are with someone and you're super
0:15loved up and you can't wait to spend the day with them having said that I don't
0:19really think that we just need one day of the year where we have to express our
0:22love and admiration for someone I feel that it should be all year round
0:26that's my only gripe with Valentine's Day or maybe you're just having a night
0:29out with your friends either way if you want to do something with your makeup
0:32then I have a look for you
0:33I decided for this tutorial only to use drugstore makeup item so the things that
0:37you would find in boots and superdrug mainly because a lot of you are asking
0:41for this
0:42and so I felt it was perfect and especially since I wanted to send to
0:47this hole around my favorite lipstick which is the remote Kate Moss 17 plus
0:51i'm just gonna throw this out there but you don't need to do yourself up for
0:55anyone
0:55you only want to do it for you because it makes you feel great and because you
1:00enjoy it
1:00that being said i am now going to show you how I did it
1:04ok so i'm just going to clip my hair back out of the way and the first thing
1:09I'm going to use is my beloved remote much perfection foundation i'm just
1:15going to be putting this all over my entire face and the brush I'm going to
1:18use is one of the Real Techniques bold metals in what I one which is like a
1:24kind of 3d triangle shape
1:30yeah
1:35I am a huge fan of this foundation
1:38I really really like it and i would say that it's probably good for all skin
1:42types
1:43it's not it's not massive coverage but it's definitely a buildable also feel
1:48like it gives my skin a really nice kind of fresh Julia which is always good
1:54ok now i'm done with foundation i'm going to move onto concealer and it's
1:57going to be absolutely no surprise to any of you that i am using the
2:00collection lasting perfection concealer actually have two shades I've got one
2:04which is fair which I'm going to pop underneath my eyes and then i have to
2:08which is cool medium which I'm going to put everywhere else on my skin and I
2:12need it
2:20ok now that i look crazy
2:24I'm gonna blend it and to do that I'm going to use this
2:28Real Techniques brush which i think is for eyeshadow but i really get the
2:31concealer and it's the bold metals 200 and I'm just gonna dab it on and blend
2:38it in
2:39tend to use a slightly lighter randomized because i feel like it really
2:41brightens and lift any kind of darkness but i have them to their which I
2:46generally do have so I quite like to you like to one there and then kind of my
2:51skin my actual skin tone for the rest of my face
2:58for my power . i am going to use the remote stay matte and this is in the
3:03color 003 peach blow
3:06I really like this because it just adds a little bit more depth
3:09normally I like to use a transparent one which you can also do if you want to but
3:12recently i've been using one with a touch of color it i'm going to use the
3:16road techniques old metals in 100 stepped up up up come up come up
3:24yeah
3:32powder done it's now time for bronze r which i think is one of my favorite
3:37stages because i feel like it just instantly makes your face look like it
3:41has some sort of dimension to it because right now I could literally be a 2d
3:45image
3:46oh no just stop this in my bronzer but how is that even possible
3:51not exactly the smallest mirror i'm going to use the same brush and I'm just
3:55gonna dump that on that the bronzer i'm using is glam bronze by L'Oreal i love
4:02this bronzer i use this a lot during the summer
4:05it's pretty much my it has like the smallest kind of Goldie shimmer in it
4:11but besides that it's pretty much a matte bronzer so you don't have to worry
4:15about too much Yuma
4:28the bronzer is done it's now time to move on to the blush i am using the
4:33bourgeois russia in 34 rose d'or not like a pulley door but like Addie
4:39' oh this is super pretty and really actually quite pigmented for this i'm
4:46going to use the Real Techniques 300 possibly one of my favorite ones and it
4:51is beautiful its rose gold and it's really small and really good for blush
4:57application especially when you want to be quite precisely you've got small
5:00cheeks
5:01I'm going to sneeze I think yeah we're really went for that
5:07don't you just hate when you're around we don't really know and you can't fully
5:11go for a siege not fully commit into the sneeze
5:14so you kind of withhold your sneeze and you kind of end it was going like the
5:19worst such a waste of the sneeze
5:23yeah
5:25and i love this blusher so much it's so pretty it almost gives like a rose gold
5:31affect your cheek but you can see the pink but you can also see like gold
5:34shimmer coming through it looks so pretty
5:37I don't know if you can see that but it looks so shiny and pretty on my cheek so
5:41it also act as a highlight as well I brought the camera closer so you can
5:45have a proper look at the skin
5:47I think it looks really nice and it looks really pretty with the blush on it
5:51now i'm going to get onto the eyes because I want to make this quite a
5:55subtle but smokey eye and focus quite a lot on the lips
6:01I'm going to make this quite neutral so i'm using the soap & Glory lister a real
6:07is called it's really good it has pretty much every color you would ever need if
6:11you just want to do a basic neutral i am going to use this shade here which is
6:15pretty much just a matte cream slush white and the brush I'm using is a real
6:20techniques base shadow brush
6:30to give it a bit of highlight I'm now going to use one of the colors in the
6:34collection little mix about the I all about the eyes palette
6:38this is about to 99 and it's actually amazing it has really nice colors in it
6:44I'm gonna go for this one which is the light one because it has a little bit of
6:47shimmer to it
6:48mostly just focusing on the inside corner because you know i'm all about
6:53the eyes felt the eyes
6:55little mix palette i'm also going to put a little bit underneath my brow bane
7:05ok next is to pop a bit of the dark color in my crease so i'm going to go
7:10back to the lid stuff palette and I'm going to take this matt brown and i'm
7:15just going to work that into the crates to do that I'm going to use the Real
7:19Techniques angled eyeshadow brush because you know i'm all about those
7:24angles about the eccles in a shadow brush
7:39i'm also going to take this color which is like a dark brown with a hint of
7:47shimmer in it
7:49i'm going to use this brush which is the real techniques - 01
7:53whoops which I dropped I'm just going to dab a tiny bit of that and just really
7:57concentrate back more in the crease
8:04ok so there's both eyes done with eyeshadow the next step is obviously
8:08eyeliner
8:09now I couldn't find one in my collection that was strictly just from boots or
8:15superdrug in the kind of make up section
8:19however I do have an urban decay which isn't technically drugstore or high
8:24street but you can buy in some boots so I'm going to pass this off just for now
8:29but if any of you have any good recommendations for any others that are
8:33slightly cheaper then leave them in the description so other people can see your
8:37comment
8:42you want to follow your bottom lash line up
8:59this is drying out on me they're just like drawing on the back of my hand
9:04one done now is the tricky part where you have to make the other I the same as
9:09this I
9:15next thing you'll do is add mascara and I want my lashes to be as big and
9:19dramatic as they possibly can
9:21you could also add false lashes
9:24I don't have any right now and for me
9:28they generally tend to ruin my makeup because I'm not very good at them
9:32unless you have a friend in which case they can help you for your false eyelash
9:37wizard and you're just really good at it but right now i am using the bourgeois
9:43volume clubbing ultra black for dramatic eyelashes
9:50boom
9:59ok so now it's time for me to fill in my eyebrows and to do this i'm just going
10:03to use a powder eyeshadow and i'm going to use the brown from the soap & Glory
10:07palette and I'm just going to fill those in with a angled liner brush
10:20so now that your whole face is complete it is time to add the lipstick
10:25now this is my favorite lipstick ever ever i am obsessed with this
10:30I feel like this shade of red really suits my skin tone and and I would just
10:34I reach for all the time it's my Rimmel Kate math 107 which is this beautiful
10:40dark red
10:41so I'm just going to apply this on my lip
10:59and now you have it that is one look that you could use for Valentine's if
11:04you have any special plans or even if you don't
11:07I hope you enjoyed this video and let me know what you think about sometimes day
11:10whether you've got any nice plans or if you're just staying at home and chilling
11:14with your friends
11:15also if you recreate this look I would absolutely love to see it so don't
11:18forget to tag me on instagram or send me your twit pics so i can see for myself
11:24thanks so much for watching guys I will see you next week
0:00hello everybody as you can see i have 0 makeup on and that is because i wanted
0:04to do my makeup on camera with you so you could see what I was doing have done
0:09an everyday makeup look I'm not going to say tutorial because as we all know all
0:13i do is put my makeup on and ramble a camera
0:16not necessarily the way that you're supposed to do it but this is the way I
0:21like to do it and you guys really like these videos so i wanted to do another
0:24one
0:24I haven't done an updated everyday makeup look for a really long time so I
0:30felt it was about time i did that and i'm really enjoying a lot of the makeup
0:35that i'm using at the moment so i really want to miss Kier
0:38the first thing i'm going to be doing is popping on my foundation the foundation
0:41i have been using an absolutely loving at the moment is the Rimmel lasting
0:45finish this promises to last for 25 hours now i can't say i've actually worn
0:50it for 25 hours because I put makeup on in the morning i take off at night so I
0:55can't say that that works because I've not tested that but i absolutely love it
1:01I love the coverage
1:02i love how it feels on the skin and it is a full coverage foundation so avoid
1:07if you don't like that but i am loving this at the moment
1:11also the brush i am using is the Sigma round kabuki
1:16I really like using kabuki brushes just because I like to kind of buffer into
1:21the skin rather than like stroking on and and this is my kabuki of choice and
1:29you can see my skin is already looking a lot more even
1:33but i do still wanna put on some concealer
1:36so on my blemishes i'm going to put the urban decay naked skin and under my eyes
1:43I'm going to go for the collection lasting protection get those knees
1:49you you
1:53well the less you now to wake myself up a little bit and pop some of the
1:59concealer under my eye I kind of bring it down from the kind of inside of my
2:04eye down towards the top of my cheekbones and then up my cheekbones
2:09but just find that kind of works and then I just blend it in again just using
2:14the same thing kabuki
2:16now that i look far more awake I have absolutely no dimensions to my face
2:21whatsoever
2:22I'm going to powder the powder have been really liking at the moment is this one
2:27it buy it buy by Terry and it's the hyaluronic hydra powder
2:33it's really really fine so I find that it goes on my skin really nicely
2:39oh gosh dropped all over my jeans
2:42i'm just going to use this brush which is B Sigma blush at mine to do a little
2:48bit up in a little bit
2:51that i am going to very lightly sweep this in any areas where I find that my
2:58makeup goes a little bit patchy fast or I can sometimes get a little bit oily
3:03throughout the day which is generally my t-zone
3:07i also like to do a little sweet under the eyes just to set my concealer and
3:13then I kind of find that it lost a lot better throughout the day
3:16next up is bronzer it's January everyone skin looks a little bit invisible little
3:22bit pale
3:23so I think I probably do overdue the bronze slightly interested in January in
3:29december but yes i am going to use not as we going to do a little bit of
3:33contouring and then i'm going to use this guerlain terracotta bronzer which
3:38you will know I'm absolutely absolutely up with absolutely obsessed with this
3:43adds a little bit of warmth
3:45where is this is slightly more than a sheet own blush to this works well as a
3:49kind of contour color hair do the overall bronze first i'm going to use
3:53the same brush
3:54you'll notice I use a lot of the same brushes I don't know if that bad or not
3:59but I mean they all do the job don't you
4:02I'm just kind of taking this across my forehead and on top of my cheeks and
4:07down by my jaw
4:09also don't forget to take it down your neck slightly because if you put a lot
4:13of bronzer on your face you don't want a different color face to your neck
4:17so try and tie it all in there we go
4:21I mean I'm not trying to look like i've been on holiday for a week but I do just
4:24want to add a little bit of color just think it makes me look a bit more
4:27healthy you know
4:29now i'm going to go in with a tiny bit of contour I'm not really this too much
4:32but I like to just do it slightly so this is in maestro 24 brush
4:38it's kind of like a fluffy contour brush and I'm just
4:42I / little bit of this on here papi tap may have gotten slightly overboard there
4:50crap ok there we got a slight bit of contour
4:57now it's time for the blusher i am using the bourgeois rose d'or Golden Rose
5:05blush
5:05this is a beautiful slightly shimmery blusher with some kind of gold running
5:11through it
5:11very very pretty I'm going to pop a little bit on my brush
5:15this is the maestro 143 I really liked my story brushes
5:18let me read to be soft and really really love me to use a little bit of color
5:23much better the last thing I'm going to put on my face is this which is the back
5:29are shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
5:34this is incredible I am obsessed with this
5:37I placed a fairly large order on court beauty and this was in it because I hear
5:42a lot of people talking about the becker highlighted and how amazing they are so
5:47I wanted to give it a go
5:49and honestly it's amazing I'm gonna put a little bit of eye primer on i have got
5:54the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer antiaging edition
5:58not that I feel as they my eyes are sacking already but you know where you
6:03can prevent it you should I am NOT looking forward to getting back you guys
6:07really know huh
6:10I don't know if I've ever said this before but if you don't have an
6:13eyeshadow primer i would strongly suggest you invest in one there's quite
6:17a lot of different brands that do them but i just find it really makes a very
6:22huge difference with how your eyeshadow applies and how long it lasts
6:26and also how it looks I just feel like it looks a lot nicer when you've got an
6:31eyeshadow base and you don't have one you should get one
6:34I've been doing this like every day for the past two weeks however with
6:38eyeshadow
6:39I kind of very up quite a lot I have
6:41doggy clawing at my legs you want to come up
6:45do you want me to do your makeup
6:48we are so needy
6:52aren't you haven't finished yet don't look at my face just done it
6:57No as I was saying before i was rudely interrupted by snorting very black dog
7:04is that are used kind of a variation of different eyeshadows every day there's
7:09not really one go to eyeshadow look I'll do a kind of mix it up quite long as
7:14we've got a lot of eyeshadows but one pallet that i have been using quite a
7:19lot is this one which is the Too Faced chocolate palette
7:22it's called chocolate bar and it has lots of really lovely kind of neutral
7:28shades in it which obviously are kind of my go-to shades
7:32I'm gonna go hazel that which is this gorgeous color here
7:35kind of like a bronze color
7:39don't worry if this part is messy by the way I'm aware i look really freaky right
7:44now but this bit doesn't need to be particularly neat
7:47I mean that's what i tell myself anyway because you can do the blending brush
7:50and make it look so much better at the end was it going to take another little
7:54brush these are my story brushes again and I'm going to take that color
7:57underneath
7:58we don't all need to hate cleaning yourself thank you very much
8:02what I definitely look slightly terrifying right now going to use port
8:07sugar oh no this is semi sweet semi-sweet which is open , which is this
8:13shade
8:14I'm going to take that in me crees
8:18I always like to have a lighter color in the corners of my eyes
8:22so I'm going to use marzipan which is this gorgeous kind of pinky champagne
8:26color and i'm going to pop a little bit of that in the corners
8:30now i'm going to fill in my brows of my trusty Mac charcoal brown and I also
8:36dabble a little bit of this one in too because my browser kind of dog right
8:43browse let's do this les habia
8:50using a little angled brush this is the Sigma small angle e65 thought my hand is
8:57bleeding man that was really weird i was like oh my god no blood they're just
9:02going crazy
9:03I feel like I've done quite well at growing my eyebrows out slightly
9:06ok my brother done i am very happy with them i'm also going to put a little bit
9:10of nylon and my brow
9:13just to give it a little bit cheeky highlight because you can never go wrong
9:17with a little bit cheeky I life
9:19football for hope it's also nice to kind of blend into the brown because then it
9:28kind of makes it less harsh
9:30I'm obsessed with this brush this is the Sigma tapered blending e-40 it's so big
9:37and so fluffy and i love it
9:40just not sure doing makeup with a runny nose is that attractive
9:45my nose is like running like a tab I'm like having to edit out lots of me like
9:51sniffling the tissues next up is a little bit of mascara
9:55this is my favorite because it just felt is completely transforms the whole look
9:59and I'm using the Maybelline lash sensational course and i found one in
10:04extra black
10:05I don't know how much more black this is in the black one but it looks extremely
10:10black and that's cool because i like black mascara also can't get this off so
10:16I managed to get it off the top car get off the block so I've just got like
10:20cellophane wrap around my mascara got back to black get my hair dyed night
10:26that album is one of my fav albums of all time
10:31laughs shit on dunzo
10:36next up army it now I've been going crazy or neutral lip that moment or new
10:42lip and this one came in my p.o box and I thought it looked really lovely and i
10:47have been wearing this for about a week and it is the wild about beauty lip
10:51pencil geo in 01
10:54Fiona it comes with the big kind of lip pencil on one end and then a line on the
11:01other end so i line my lips with this side and then I fill it in with this one
11:05and that is the finished look I really hope you like it
11:09I'm pretty much obsessed with that hence why I've been doing this every day for
11:13like the past two weeks

0:00how everybody today i wanted to do a makeup look
0:03now i don't do this very often on my channel because i'm not a professional
0:06my technique is probably a bit crappy but you guys like the makeup that I
0:12managed to and i have been wearing a look quite a lot recently which is a
0:17gold shimmery eye and a pinky nude lips so i thought i would do that for you in
0:20today's video we're going to do is pin back my crazy wild most annoying orange
0:26they're my friends have a very love/hate relationship sometimes it's applied to
0:30incorporate other days I kind of want to go at it with a pair of scissors are
0:36today is one of those days
0:38I'm going to make this kind of a chatty video because I hate making videos where
0:43I'm not talking with you guys because it feels weird
0:47I was going to kind of put a little bit of music and voice over and then I
0:51remembered
0:51I'm crap voiceover so i'm not going to do that I'm just gonna chat with ya
0:55i'm using the NARS sheer glow foundation have been loving the new one which are
1:01cannot remember the name of now it was in my favorite
1:03I've been loving that but I've also still be loving my trusty my trusty
1:08share globe which are do have a pump for I've just realized i just have to put it
1:12on the new bottle just anyone else is not bottles do that
1:16the lid is not central to the front of the bottle and if I don't do it like
1:23that it's too loose
1:24see all yes issues first world problems i am going to use this brush which is
1:32the Sigma 3d HD kabuki
1:35this looks incredible i'm not actually uses before so I'm very excited
1:42foundation done i am now going to move on to my concealer and it's going to be
1:54absolutely no surprise to most to be that i am using the collection lasting
1:59perfection concealer going to pull it all back my hand because i do have some
2:04spots at the moment and I don't want to be spreading that so it's always wise to
2:09do that I'm going to use the same sort of brush but this is the 3d HD precision
2:15brush by Sigma and its kind of information one funny little angles
2:21don't you got to adapt up coming up we're going to dipped up and i'm going
2:28to really lightly just put that over any of my blemishes
2:41i also have quite a bit of redness around me knows that always an area i
2:46have to kind of concentrate on as well
2:48it's really good for getting in there was little it looks and cranny
2:53I never really concentrate on what my face looks like what I'm doing that I
2:59can only imagine the sort of faces
3:01you probably won't even come after we edit them out because I'm in charge
3:10ok now that my face is completely done like the base
3:16I want to put a bit of powder on now I'm filming this on white bed sheet and this
3:23is the loose powder I'm a little worried I'm going to get this absolutely
3:27everywhere but this is the Delilah up your touch micro-fine loose powder in
3:32translucent this powder is in credible is so fine you don't even feel it on
3:38your face and I find that it sets my makeup amazingly and makes it last a
3:43really long time and also doesn't make my face look cakey for a very long time
3:47I avoided powders because I like my face it up to me I like my face looks full of
3:51life and when I saw people kind of read mattifying their face and putting a lot
3:56of powder and I was like should I be doing that
3:58I'm not sure I'm it is good to set your foundation because it is a cream and
4:03it's going to kind of move around a little bit easier but during this makes
4:07it last a lot longer and not all powders make your face look cakey not all powers
4:11feel heavy and all powders give a really matter of fact either
4:15which one the power of my face i'm going to use two brushes and use this one
4:19which is the Sigma powder
4:20flash flash in f10 and i'm going to lightly down flat and then I'm just
4:29gonna dust that across most of my face
4:39mostly just concentrated on areas where my makeup kind of disappears first which
4:44is generally my t-zone and then going to go with a smaller version of that which
4:50is the extravaganza tapered blending e-40 i'm just going to take a tiny bit
4:56on that and i'm going to go underneath my eyes just to set my concealer a
5:00little bit
5:04oh I got something in my eye ah got it
5:10happy with that I'm happy with that if what do I do next
5:13all blush or bronzer i'm going to use this which is the CRT London
5:17i'm saying that right ciate I like this because it is a matte bronzer and it is
5:24a really good shade for my skin
5:26not too dark the color is Palm Island we use this one which is the Sigma blush
5:32s-92 i'm using all Sigma brushes
5:36today I'm really impressed of them right now
5:40no I'm singing to my god
5:54and i'm sure you are all aware by now when you put bronzer on you want to put
5:59it on all the places that the Sun would naturally make you a little bit bronze
6:05I feel like bronze it works really well with this lip because it's quite gold
6:10and it's quite kind of kinky and i think a more bronzy look goes really nicely
6:16with this so I do put a little bit more bronzer on than I normally would but I
6:20just think it works really well and since this one is kind of coming out
6:24kinda works
6:26I think this yeah don't think for blusher
6:31i am going to use the Charlotte celebrate cheek to cheek push and pop
6:37Russia
6:38I love this I think it has a kind of sunkist being out on holiday look to it
6:44and as I just mentioned with the bronzer I kind of feel like this ties in quite
6:48nicely with that pretty well i'm using the power blush again use brushes how
6:57you want to use brushes don't follow the rules be a brush rebel
7:04just popping out on the apples and bring it back
7:08pretty sure that's not technical town 15 much on the cheek and this is why you
7:13should never take my advice as a professional because i am not one and
7:17sometimes I put too much on and I look like I'm going out
7:22that's fancy dress ok rectify the problem
7:25next I'm going to move on to the eyes which is you know my favorite part
7:29I'm i'm going to be using my by Terry on Bray black star in the color beyond gold
7:35because it is beautiful and this is a golden look and I kind of feel like this
7:40is the perfect thing to you or just whatever never shut it probably last
7:43time i used it if it's not dried out
7:45ok well now i wish i'd had my eyebrows threaded before from this video don't
7:49look too closely looking out
7:51i'm going to put the gold on my entire eyelid
7:56you don't really have to worry about this looking super super pretty and also
8:00really nicely blended because this is kind of the base
8:14also going to drive a tiny bit under the eye just this way
8:18next I'm going to use the sea otter London collins avenue loose kind of
8:23shimmer gold pigment
8:25this looks incredible on the eyes so I actually going to use the Sigma blending
8:31e25 to pack that on
8:46see how morning was never guys just not the way you hold the mirror just not
8:51ours so she could keep your hand in it but I also feel like this mix my
8:56blue-eyes it's very blue eyes
8:59so far now i am going to use another fluffy brush
9:04this is the type of blending be 35 and I think about you . color into the crease
9:09so for the crease i'm going to use buck which is a color in the first original
9:15urban decay naked palette i'm just going to put a tiny little bit that in there
9:18and blend in
9:19only to give it a bit more depth but be honest I quite like leaving it at that
9:25i'm also going to take this brush brush
9:34ultratech this branch i'm also going to take this brush which is the Sigma short
9:40shader e20 i'm going to go in with the same color and just have that kind of in
9:47the outer corner bring it into the goals I / in already
9:54ok I'm happy with that so now i'm going to move onto eyeliner i like to use a
9:59brown pencil and just smudge it on my top lash line for this look because I
10:03think it kind of keeps it casual
10:05rather than going all out with a big cat I which normally i returned to do but I
10:10quite like just having the brown
10:12marjina
10:24you got to say that the eye line that i use is the eye of or I of hora hora
10:30I think it's for us I'm not sure and it's just a brown brown pencil
10:36now i'm simply going to use the other end of the pencil too much that out just
10:40a tiny tiny bit
10:44there we go now for mascara i am using my trusty benefit roller lash which I am
10:54obsessed with skill
10:59look at the difference in the eyes
11:05and i also am a scar on the bottom lashes type of gal i know not everyone
11:09liked to do it the idea because I felt like opens at my eyes slightly now it's
11:16time for my eyebrows
11:17I always love using this actually forgotten what it's called I've got it
11:22in a quad this is kind of like my most used mac colors and i always use this
11:26one I think it's called soft charcoaled not definitely hold that candy chocolate
11:33brown
11:34I was close soft chocolate chocolate brown chocolate brown is the color that
11:38I will always use in my eyebrows so i'm going to use that color and i'm also
11:43going to use an angled brush where ru angled brush here is this is the Sigma
11:49small angle e e65 now we have focused
11:56I tend to start in and then kind of work my way through
12:04well I drop the brush at the moment I'm trying to grow my browser bit thicker so
12:10it is quite a challenge putting them in if any of you get your brows done you'll
12:15know how much more easy it is once they've been threaded or waxed or
12:20however else you maintain your brows to actually fill them like sometimes you
12:24don't even need to do anything I haven't had mine tinted all threaded for a while
12:29so this takes a bit longer
12:32the moment it go hard trying to make them look the same but remember ladies
12:38I browser sister's not twins tell myself
12:42most days ok now that my rather done and i'm feeling so much more human
12:48i am going to go straight in with the lipstick and lipstick i'm using is the
12:53kate moss number 38 which is this gorgeous
12:58pinky nude kind of thing
13:02nude generally the words how many kind of makes me go whoo
13:06maybe because i don't want salmon and also because someone pink just isn't a
13:11nice sounding color is also not really the most flattering color to wear
13:16what's on your lips it looks beautiful and very unfair she
13:23oh my god I just love these lipstick so very much
13:37I've basically been loving doing this look obviously without the pressure of
13:43the camera and making sure I don't screw up anywhere and I do it a lot quicker
13:48than that
13:49normal on a day-to-day basis I can do that pretty quickly but there are all be
13:53watching this so the pressure is unreal
13:55I don't really know what I'm going to call it may be golden
13:58salmon sounds like a recipe maybe a work call it that

0:05that is because i'm going to be doing a kind of every day
0:10autumn makeup look this is the look that I've been wearing quite a lot recently
0:13and a lot of you have been asking me how I've done it and which products I've
0:17used to do it so I thought it would be good to do a kind of updated version
0:22because i have actually done this video last year and it is very very similar
0:26although now i am using slightly different products so it's kind of
0:29basically an updated or to make up routine have brought back my little
0:33autumn tree much too i'll be absolute horror because he hates that term and
0:38I've got a candlelit down here which is leaves my body works and it smells
0:42incredible in here and you can see I have zero makeup on right now I'm having
0:46a little bit of a spot crisis but that's okay cause so it's like everyone else in
0:50the world
0:51unless you're one of those really lucky people that just have perfect skin in
0:55which case i am the you and also well done
1:00share your secret anyway i'm going to get started because it's going to be a
1:05long video of white
1:07I've already put my serum on and put moisturizer on so the first thing I'm
1:11going to be doing is putting on my foundation at the moment I am really
1:14loving this foundation which is the born this way to face foundation
1:18I just feel like it has really great coverage and looks nice shade i am the
1:23shade i am his ivory like a little ice gem
1:26I love ice James using a dirty Real Techniques brush by sam Nick Chapman
1:42I didn't think about wearing a jumper with two lights on me a candle burning
1:46in the same tiny room
1:48that is to say I'm very hot right now i'm going to use two shades of
1:57collection lasting perfection concealer i like to use really like one under my
2:02eyes in there and then on my skin I use cool medium
2:06so any areas that i need to put a little bit of concealer on with my spot
2:11I'm just going to put it on the back of my hand so don't want to transfer
2:15bacteria into the pot I'm going to use my beauty blender which is a new
2:20addition to my makeup one I actually really like I feel like this is going to
2:27be in my favorites this month
2:29ok naughty puppy naughty puppy
2:34no you're not supposed to eat that no this is not a game
2:40come on you can get out I always feel like if you spend a bit more time making
2:45sure your base is good then everything else kind of follows quite easily just
2:49going to put a little bit of the fat and my eyes
3:01ok concealer and foundation done it is now time to powder
3:04I am actually going to use the mac studio fix powder
3:08this is a little bit more of a heavy coverage i know some people that use
3:11this just for like foundation but i just wanted to try it i bought the other day
3:15because so many people rave about it that I kind of just when I got it
3:20i'm using my Sigma blush brush in s-92
3:31now it's time for bronzer and i have been loving hula by benefit i have this
3:37in my favorite so I'm going to watch some of that on and i'm going to use the
3:40same brush actually
3:51I'm not going to charlotte tilbury film star bronze and globe Scott and
3:55highlight just add a little bit more definition
3:58I can see floaty stars does that mean I'm about to say
4:02nah I'll be fine
4:10I'm not going to use a little bit of the highlight and pop that on the tops of my
4:15cheekbones or whatever cheekbones of God got great cheekbones and the Coney Jolie
4:25she's got beautiful cheekbones always stare at them whenever she talks to me
4:31that night
4:33next is Kiko and blusher in tribal soul baked blush in wild mode
4:40this is amazing I pretty sure to put this in a favorite at some point but
4:43it's really very beautiful and smells like vanilla and try it doesn't taste of
4:53vanilla
4:58and the brush I'm using for this is the maestro 148 which is one of my all-time
5:03favorite brushes it's just amazing
5:06i'm going to put a little bit of eye primer on this is the estee lauder pure
5:12color in to which is halo and it's just a really lovely kind of match Paige
5:18I mean if that's lovely at all i don't i don't know if that's what you're not
5:22smart kind of rank though not going to lie
5:34zoomed in a little bit so you can see the eyes of it clear i do want to just
5:38quickly apologized this tape my eyebrows
5:40i'm currently waiting to get them threaded and I didn't really want to
5:43pluck them before this video because then I knew I would have hated myself
5:45when it actually came to going to get them plucked because I'm supposed to
5:50leave them aren't you
5:51very difficult that is one thing that's actually quite difficult about getting
5:54your brows done
5:55ok so for the eyes i'm going to use this which I have absolutely raved about if
6:00any of you follow my blog
6:01then you'll know that I spoken about this since I think 2010 2011 and it is
6:06not is old or eyes old and its really - really beautiful kind of burnt orange
6:12shimmery gold shades that really make blue eyes stand out and I just go back
6:20to this all the time so I definitely want to use this here and this is one
6:25that I actually use most of the time I'm surprised it's not more dented than this
6:31so I'm going to use the darker shade and i'm just going to pop that kind of from
6:35the middle out
6:43but don't worry this point it doesn't need to be neat hat sponge your eyeball
6:50move and again on the other side
6:57this is already so autumnal finally & colca but all things
7:01great pop a little bit of mac and the light on the inner corner going to use
7:07the same brush because why not
7:17now you want to get a tiny teeny tiny little shader brush and you want to put
7:21a little bit of amber lights just underneath the eye
7:30and kind of bring it into the center just past the center now you're gonna
7:34want a blending brush and I'm going to use a matte shade
7:40this I believe is chocolate brown and i'm going to just pop a little bit of
7:44that in there and I'm going to go in the outer V
8:00we're going to use a slightly fluffier brush this is the Sigma tapered blending
8:04and i'm just going to blend the whole thing
8:11I'm just gonna take a smidgen of slightly darker Matt Brown and I'm going
8:16to go right in the crease and kind of give that a little bit more definition
8:22yeah
8:27vacation is looking to just really blend every autumnal color in your eye shadow
8:32palette until it looks ok I'm going to then put a little bit of the not quite
8:38as dark brown to this one just in the outer part underneath the bottom lash
8:43line
8:49this kind of brings the whole thing in together now next thing I'm going to do
8:52is my brows and where this is kind of strange order of doing my eye makeup but
8:56I kind of feel like once I have the eyeshadow on and then I put my brows on
9:00it doesn't look scary just going to use that same brown and a little angled
9:05brush and I kind of just do like really small hair like strikes
9:21this looks so weird i always find where you just had your brows done it takes
9:25like no time at all to your brows
9:27however when you need to get them done it takes a really long time and that is
9:32the issue I'm having right now
9:35ok this looks really weird but my eyebrows are done
9:39next up is a little cat flick and i'm going to use the charlotte tilbury the
9:43feline slick which is amazing
9:46pray to the cat I gods but i actually get this ride
10:20now it's time to scar which I always find makes the most difference
10:23this is the Maybelline lash sensational
10:26it's incredible lots of edibles
10:43ok mascara done is going to put a teeny bit of highlighter and my brow bone
10:47using the little fluffy brush again and I'm going to use macs vanilla
10:52no nylon Mac nylon
10:56now it's time for my favorite bit
11:01the lipstick charlotte tilbury glastonbury will never stop going on
11:05about it
11:20I do you think that if you're not used to wearing a dark lipstick it is really
11:24good to use a lip liner because it is quite a dark color
11:28however I reckon I could probably put that on in the dark because I put it on
11:31so much so I'm kind of used to doing it but if you struggle a little bit with
11:36our colors i would recommend using a point of first or using a lip brush and
11:40kind of just stopping it on your lipstick and then applying it around
11:44your lip line before filling it in with the actual lipstick
11:46ok so this is the finished look it is gold on the eyes and a very tone on the
11:51lips
11:52I absolutely love it it's just basically my autumn makeup look most of you will
11:57know this because in my second Channel videos I'm basically wearing it

12:45thanks so much for watching guys and see you again soon
0:00Hello everybody! Today I'm going to be showing you
0:01how I did this bronzed nude look.
0:04Which I think is perfect for this time of the year
0:07or if you're anything like me
0:09and you can kinda get away with fake tanning your body,
0:12but the minute you try and fake tan your face
0:14everything goes completely wrong.
0:16I always whip out the bronzer around this time of the year,
0:19so I thought it was only right to do a very bronzey look.
0:23So let's get started.
0:25I've already put my serum on and my moisturiser on,
0:29so now I just need to start on me face.
0:32I'm gonna use the NARS Sheer Glow in the shade Mont Blanc
0:36just because I flippin' love this foundation.
0:40Ooh, forgot my foundation brush.
0:43I'm really loving stippling brushes at the moment,
0:47so I'm using the Real Techniques stippling brush.
0:49And I'm just gonna dip it in here.
0:54I really feel like NARS Sheer Glow is that one foundation
0:57I always come back to.
0:59I really love it.
1:03Now I'm gonna use the Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer,
1:06which I really love, you guys know how much I love this.
1:11And I'm just putting that on any like...
1:15random marks.
1:17And I'm gonna pop a little bit of the Collection Lasting Perfection Concealer in Fair
1:23straight under my eyes.
1:28And yes, I put quite a lot of concealer on.
1:31Especially on mornings, where I have woken up and I'm like
1:33"Did I sleep last night? Like what are all these bags about?"
1:36And I'm also using a Real Techniques brush
1:39and this is the setting brush.
1:40I have been really enjoying using this for blending concealer.
1:44It takes a little bit longer than if you where to use your finger
1:47or if you were to use your foundation brush or a sponge.
1:50But I really, really like it and I just feel like it's lasting better throughout the day.
1:54I'm not sure. I'll show you what I mean.
2:08The concealer is now done,
2:09I'm gonna use the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Luminous Light.
2:15And I'm gonna use...
2:19The Sigma Large Powder Brush.
2:24I've already raved about this powder quite a lot,
2:27so I'm not gonna say too much about it.
2:29But I really, really love that it makes your skin look quite glowing.
2:32And for this look I feel like that is a necessity,
2:36so I am loving using that at the moment.
2:39Gonna do a little bit of contouring using
2:42my Anastasia Beverly Hills Contour Palette in Light to Medium.
2:46And I'm gonna use this shade,
2:49which is the sort of middle... I don't know.
2:53Ashy-ish brown.
2:57And I'm also using my Charlotte Tilbury Powder & Sculpt.
3:04Gonna do a little bit under me double chin.
3:12Now, I am going to put a little bit of
3:15the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Potion--
3:18Primer Potion.
3:20And just let that kinda sink in.
3:31There we go.
3:32Okay, and next thing I'm gonna do is bronze.
3:36Now, this is kind of the key part to this
3:39and I feel like so many people get scared of wearing bronzer
3:42and I know it's easy to overdo it, but...
3:45But I just feel like in summer, can you really overdo the bronzer?
3:49I'm using the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Bronzer
3:53in Radiant Bronze Light.
3:54I love things like this.
3:57That have like a little bit of shimmer in them.
3:59I think now is like the best time to be wearing things like this.
4:03Pretty much the rest of the year I wear bronzers that are kind of
4:06matt or have like the tiniest bit of shimmer, but...
4:09For a bronzey look I just think you should go all out
4:13on the bronze.
4:21I feel like the key to all bronzing is to make sure you take it down your neck as well,
4:26because you don't want like a super bronzed face
4:29and then no bronzing on the neck.
4:35Because I'm keeping this look quite bronzey
4:38I don't wanna do too much cheek color, but I am going to put a tiny bit on.
4:42So I'm gonna use the Becca x Jaclyn Hill Champagne...
4:46Champagne Collection Face Palette
4:48in the color Rosé Spritz which is this one.
4:52And I'm literally gonna put the tiniest amount on my cheeks,
4:55because this is super pigmented.
5:01And then using my Real Techniques Fan Brush...
5:06I always grew up throwing these things away,
5:10being like "What do people even use these for?".
5:13I just found them so like confusing, and i was like
5:17"What is this for?"
5:19Um, but recently I've actually been using this one for highlight,
5:22because, I don't know, it just...
5:25works really well.
5:26Because it gives you like a really light touch.
5:29And I'm literally gonna put the smallest amount on,
5:31because as you'll see this highlight is insane
5:33and it's from the same face palette and it's the...
5:38Champagne Pop.
5:39It's insane.
5:49Face is pretty much done,
5:51so the only thing we need to now is the eyes and the eyebrows and the lips.
5:56So... eyes.
5:58I'm gonna use my beloved Too Faced Sweet Peach Palette,
6:01because you guys know how much I love these shades.
6:05Oops, I definitely just stuck a finger in one of them.
6:07And I think they go really, really perfectly well with a bronzey make up look.
6:11The colours I am going to use are: Caramelized first all over the lid.
6:26At this point I'm just kind of packing the colour on,
6:28because we're gonna blend it anyway.
6:31Looks kinda terrifying.
6:33I am going to take the shade Luscious, which is this one.
6:38And I'm gonna go in the inner corner .
6:47Now I'm gonna take a smaller brush
6:50and this is a Clover one again.
6:52And I'm just gonna put a little bit of the Luscious in the inner corners of the eyes.
6:59And then using the same brush I'm gonna go in with Caramelized
7:02and I'm gonna pop that on the, um...
7:04outer half of the bottom lash line.
7:12And then using a Sigma Blending E25
7:17I'm gonna go in with the Charmed, I'm Sure matt brown.
7:26Gonna do me eyebrows.
7:28I'm gonna use these two shades combined, because I've just had them tinted
7:31so they're slightly darker than normal.
7:33The only annoying thing is that I don't know what the shades are.
7:37Oh!
7:38Bare with, bare with...
7:40The slightly darker one is Mystery and this one is Charcoal Brown.
7:43Uh, FYI...
7:44Tint your eyebrows.
7:45It's just the best thing ever, it's so great.
7:49Just makes life so much easier.
7:51Makes your eyebrows so much easier.
7:53Maybe not life. Eyebrows.
7:54I'm just using a MAC 266
7:56to pop that in me brows.
8:06One.
8:07Look at the difference in my eyebrows right now.
8:12I always think eyebrows look so scary
8:16before you've done anything else--
8:18Okay they look quite dark actually. What have I done.
8:20I'm gonna use a little bit of Ready, Set, Brow!
8:23Maybe I should've done my brows first.
8:27Let's just claim some of that powder out.
8:30You know guys...
8:32Sometimes your brow game...
8:34is a lot stronger in terms of colour, not in terms of, you know...
8:39brow game strong.
8:40You know? Do you know what I mean?
8:41You know what I mean.
8:42They're quite dark.
8:43Are they?
8:45I can't figure it out.
8:47I think I need to just put my mascara on and then I can make that decision.
8:50Okay, so mascara...
8:52I'm using the Smashbox
8:55Indecent Exposure.
8:58Which I am obsessed with at the moment,
9:01because it's beautiful and makes your eyelashes beautiful.
9:10If you don't like thick mascaras, you probably won't like this,
9:14but I love thick mascaras.
9:17I love when they're a little bit--
9:19Oh god, I don't love when I drop some on my lower lash line
9:22and it smudges into everything I've already done.
9:25Look at the difference
9:26in my eyelashes right now.
9:28Is this too close?
9:30Most probably.
9:31Slightly verging on clumpy eyelashes are my fave.
9:34And I'm gonna use a little bit of Clinique Bottom Lash Mascara,
9:37because it is the only thing that I can put on my bottom lashes
9:41and it doesn't end up down my face half--
9:43halfway through the day.
9:46I'm holding my breath.
9:49Ooh, come back into focus.
9:52I'm gonna use a little bit of the Benefit High Brow Glow under my eyebrows.
9:56And I'm just gonna draw that on.
10:04Pencils like this after you've had your brows done
10:07are like life lifesavers, because they just look so good.
10:10I'm just gonna blend that a little bit with my finger, just because...
10:14it's quite...
10:17it's quite harsh right now.
10:20Do you know what guys?
10:21After doing my eyes I feel like we could put a little bit more bronzer on.
10:24You know? This is a bronzed look after all.
10:26So I'm gonna go in with a little bit more bronzer.
10:32Bronzed to the hills.
10:34To the heights.
10:35Bronzed...
10:36Really bronzed.
10:38And because this look is really bronzey
10:40and the eyes are really bronzey,
10:42I wanna keep the eyes quite neutral.
10:44So I'm going for a nude.
10:46Lip liner, I'm gonna use...
10:48the Barry M Lip Liner in the colour...17.
10:52Colour 17.
10:57My mirror is really far away from me right now
10:59and I'm just thinking that's probably not the best idea when doing lip liner.
11:06Probably should've put some, um...
11:12I would completely just wear this on it's own.
11:14However, I'm gonna put a little bit of this over the top, which is the
11:18NYX Liquid Suede...
11:21in the colour Sandstorm.
11:24And every time I wear this you guys are like
11:26"What are you wearing on your lips?!"
11:27It's mostly this.
11:37Let's just let that dry.
11:39It dries like a matt and it's so pretty.
11:42Right now it's still quite liquidy.
11:44Okay, so that is the finished look.
11:46I am quite obsessed with this.
11:49I know that for the continuation of summer
11:51I'm gonna be bronzing up.
11:53I just love this bronzer.
11:56I think this is... I mean this is what made the look, to be honest.
12:00And if there was a time where you can overdo the bronzer
12:05it is for sure summertime.
12:07I really hope you guys enjoyed this little tutorial.
12:10If you did, make sure to give the video thumbs up.
12:13And also leave suggestions for any other make up looks
12:16you've either seen me wear or you think I should try...
12:19I hope you've had a really lovely week
12:21and I will see you again very soon.
12:23Bye!
0:00hello everyone today I'm going to talk you through the makeup that I am
0:04currently wearing on a pretty much everyday basis i upload second channel
0:09videos if any of you didn't realize there's a little plug for you and a lot
0:13of you have been asking me in the comments what makeup
0:15I've been wearing so is that I've just applied to thousands of comments telling
0:20you what foundation i'm wearing what this car and wearing
0:23I just thought i would attempt attempt being the key word here to do a tutorial
0:29talking you through the different items that i use on my face and how i use them
0:34and how I put them on just so that those of you who are really interested now no
0:39I am NOT a makeup artist that just has to be thrown out but if i do something
0:44that offends you or my brushes too dirty or I'm not doing something the way that
0:49you would do it
0:50that's okay because we all have our different techniques and we all have our
0:54different ways of doing things
0:56this is just mine i'm not saying that you have to completely copy me or you
1:00have to do everything the same way I'm doing it or even use the exact same
1:02product if you have anything that's similar or you find something that's a
1:06lot cheaper that does just about the same job and looks the same and then
1:11good on you and let me know what it is in the comments i can buy it ok so the
1:15first thing that I did was I put on my moisturizer and my eye cream and now i
1:21am going to do my foundation I'm using the NARS sheer glow in mont blanc which
1:27is very very pale
1:28I'm just gonna put a little bit of that in the back of my hand because i don't
1:31have a pump and apparently they just never have the pump in stock
1:36every time i go and dance i'm going to be using my zoeva 102 silk finished
1:42brush
1:43none of my brushes are clean but and it's just because i use them
1:48I need to watch them though so
1:53yeah
1:57ok foundation done i'm going to put a tiny bit of concealer in the places that
2:01i feel like i need it which is just under my eyes and a little bit of
2:06redness on my nose and anywhere else where patty stop
2:18as you can see i don't really go sparing me on the or concealer consider the
2:22ideas is the little wake me up concealer in number
2:27I don't know ivory
2:30i am going to use the zoeva face shape brush just to blend that in mind just
2:40doctor cut it cut it out the word patch it in with the brush
2:50I look really pale now who could put some color on my face
2:54so I'm going to use my bronzer which at the moment is the estee lauder bronze
3:00goddess bronzer actually it's quite like a ready undertone and it's matt and I've
3:06just been really enjoying that
3:07so i'm going to be using my Mac 109 brush to do that
3:12yeah
3:19and i'm going to take a tiny little bit on this brush which is the so even when
3:22I see how to brush I'm going to take it down my neck a little bit
3:27yeah
3:34now i have a bit more color to my say i am going to do some balagia this is my
3:40favorite at the moment I've been absolutely loving it
3:43I'm really sorry its limited edition if you can find anything that's anywhere
3:47nice and when I do leave it in the comments and suggestions for other
3:50people because it's just too beautiful and also i'm going to want to have this
3:54at some point so i don't really need something to replace it with is the
3:57estee lauder pure color in T's it looks like this
4:01it's absolutely gorgeous it's basically a blush and highlight all in one and i
4:05just got my zoeva one year one to seven bucks sheer cheek I'm just gonna wear
4:13these burly equally
4:22yeah
4:25yeah
4:31I think it makes me look really like to help feel like i don't know i just i
4:35love it
4:35it's basically a pink with a sheen to it but it's beautiful
4:40I'm gonna do my eyebrows i'm using the archery by soap & Glory pencil /
4:46felt-tip pens pencils at one end and that's at the other end
4:50I am absolutely freaking loving this
4:54if I cannot find it in my drive that has like a little mini like planet
4:57I really like a felt-tip side family enough which i never thought i would say
5:01that will always be like an eyebrow pencil powder salt person but since I've
5:05been getting my eyebrows done i get them tinted and it just becomes a whole lot
5:09easier to fill in your brows you find that you don't really need to do much
5:12work i just like to meet in the back slightly
5:19this one done makes a whole lot of difference eyebrows did the next thing
5:32I've been doing with my eyes just to be like super quick super simple
5:37if I'm running out the door and going shopping I don't really like to spend
5:41too much time i make up at the moment because I quite like it to look
5:44minimal so i've been using these which rd and by Terry on Bray black star
5:53they're basically eyeshadow crayons and they are amazing i mentioned this way
5:58back in like my November favorites or something when I had all the boys in the
6:03video with me and I just love them i have for now
6:07like someone needs to basically just take me away from the by Terry counter
6:12and the one that i've been really loving is like a really soft baby pink and this
6:16is the frozen corpse one
6:19it's quite light shimmery is really pretty it's just a very nice pink and
6:23that basically just do a wash of this over both eyes and then blend
6:37once I've Smith that on I kind of want to blend it so i'm going to use a weaver
6:42petite crease because i have a petite creases from really weird and I'm just
6:48going to blend and appear basically not too much
7:02yeah
7:03i'm also going to use a much lighter one and this is called a blonde Oh Paul I'm
7:09just going to pop a little bit of that in the corners of my eyes and just under
7:11here
7:13and then going to take this little brush which is so either precise shader and
7:18I'm just gonna you know
7:19blendy blendy
7:24I'm then going to take a color from my mac eyeshadow court and it is mystery
7:29which is a matte dark brown and I'm just going to go in in my lash line at the
7:35top and also underneath my lash line down here slightly and smudge it in
7:42I've been doing this a lot recently instead of eyeliner and I just feel like
7:46it's a lot more natural but it's also a lot less precise because you don't have
7:51to be as careful
7:54so you could say I've gotten I lazy
7:59so now i have done my eyes and I need to now put mascara on the mascara i have
8:04been loving recently is on the floor hang on
8:08so this mascara is the charlotte tilbury full-fat lashes five-star mascara
8:14Carl separation volume length and drama that claims to do a lot of things and i
8:20love it
8:27look at the difference in my eyes right now
8:31that's crazy
8:37scar now done I'm gonna use my teeny tiny little clinic bottom lash mascara
8:43which I totally forgot I had and got quite excited by when I found it which
8:50I'm just going to do two separate my bottom lashes a little that
8:57and then last but not least i am going to finish this off with a lip gloss and
9:04of course it is my gorgeous friend tanya burr lip gloss
9:07this is my current favorite one she has many that i love and not being biased
9:11but I love them and it's the one called chic

9:55Percy - Percy shader online focus
10:02click mark
10:06close don't I don't I
10:11this is why don't you make up tutorials guys
0:00everybody firstly I just quite like to ask how you are
0:03because I feel like you guys are always asking me how I am and i would actually
0:06quite like to know how you are so tell me what exciting thing you've done this
0:10week and on a scale of one to ten how good is your mood
0:15swallow I wanted to do something a little bit different this week so you
0:19guys absolutely love when I do my kind of makeup tutorials
0:23I really hate calling them that because let's face it i'm not the best but I'll
0:26give it my best shot and they do always say that
0:29taking part is the part of matter what do you think that's not what I say it's
0:33a taking part that matters right
0:37maybe so although I am NOT a makeup genius like do you love doing these for
0:43you and you're going to be like watching them and so I of course want to make
0:47more and i also really like to ramble as you guys know so i thought i would use
0:51my little bit different kind of like a show and tell
0:54if you will so I have done this makeup look
0:58and I just wanted to kind of run you through the product as i show you how i
1:03do that instead of me kind of rambling and I'm trying to do it which let's be
1:06honest sometimes is a little bit i'm at the makeup look I'm going to be chatting
1:10you through today is this one which i'm just going to call pink
1:15p pinky pink a lot of pink
1:19i have been loving baby pink at the moment I've won this makeup look a few
1:22times and you've all been desperate to see how I did it I try to use a really
1:26good mixture of affordable and slightly more higher-end products just so i know
1:32that it's kind of a good mixture for everybody
1:35however if you do see something that you know there's a more affordable jump for
1:39then let everybody know in the comments or let me know i'd like to know too
1:43so I really hope you into it so let's get started
1:46the first thing that I used on my face was a new foundation that i have
1:50recently discovered because it was sent to my PA rock and it is tart and it's
1:56the rainforests of the sea water foundation
1:59this stuff is so good I really really like it i would say it has a medium to
2:04buildable coverage and it has this really cool kind of dropper and I just
2:11think the packaging is amazing is this gorgeous frosted glass bottle tight as a
2:14brand that I really really recommend they have so many amazing products and I
2:20feel like that price range is actually too bad
2:23the only thing I would say about time is it slightly more difficult to get hold
2:26of
2:26if you are here in the UK but I was super excited to receive this along with
2:31the other things in the rainforests of the CD collection and so far i'm really
2:35loving this foundation
2:36I feel like it goes on really nicely a blend very well and it just lasts three
2:41well throughout the day
2:42I'm not normally one to rave about water-based foundation
2:46I they don't necessarily work for me but this one I'm getting on with really well
2:52and I think I've almost every day for like the past 10 days
2:55so yes really loving that of the moment and the packaging is just beautiful for
3:00my blemishes
3:01they can see that I used was my ever so favorite the urban decay naked skin
3:06concealer
3:07this stuff is slightly more on the pricey side but i find that the coverage
3:11it gives and the way it kind of sinks into your skin without it looking like
3:16you're caking over a blemish
3:18I find it just works really really well it gives a really nice kind of
3:22airbrushed look almost like you know photoshop when you can just like go over
3:27something with color is called the clone tool but don't quote me on that have a
3:30nice way to shop in a real long time
3:32it's kind of like you're doing that you're taking one part of your skin
3:34that's good I like placing it over and it just works really well the only thing
3:39i will say about these is make sure you color match
3:42don't kind of guess on line because the colors I'm very so much and quite a lot
3:47of them are quite orange and time so just make sure you check that before you
3:51buy one put on your face and my eyes I used my favorite concealer of all time
3:56ever ever literally think i purchased about 20 in my lifetime
4:00the collection lasting perfection concealer
4:03this stuff is the perfect shade under my eyes I generally just dab it in kind of
4:08like a triangular shape because I was not blessed with the bright under eye
4:14area
4:15thanks fam so I put a little bit that on and just using my sponge which is what I
4:21used for my foundation and my other concealer
4:24I then blend that in and i just find it gives great coverage
4:29it's so affordable and it lasts all day pretty much
4:33I am one of these people who knows you need to powder in order for your makeup
4:38to last well and look the best it can be for the most amount of time
4:41however I don't like my skin to look really mad I feel like it makes it look
4:47a bit muddy and I find that products to blend as well I find powder the hardest
4:51thing to get right
4:53I've tried so many powders and that are ones i absolutely love most of which are
4:57actually loose powders
4:59but I just find that there's such a fine line between a good amount of powder and
5:05all of a sudden too much powder i have recently been using the AL glass and
5:10being lighting powder in luminous light
5:13I believe this is a powder to use on your face imagine if this was just a
5:17highlighter that I've just been like brushing all over
5:19I'm raise your bid is a powder that you can use but it gives my face much more
5:25of a luminous finish and I really notice the difference in photos and videos
5:30especially that it just makes my complexion appear brighter but also
5:35powder so it also kind of combat the whole kind of oiliness and makeup
5:42movement
5:43if any of you are looking for something that does a similar thing if you feel
5:46that your face kind of goes a bit flat once you put powder on
5:49try this honestly I love it
5:52I don't know why it's taken me so long to try that the next thing I used was
5:56this L'Oreal glam bronze contour kit so you've got the contour on one side and
6:00then you've got a highlighter on the other one of my favorite bronzers a
6:03whole time is actually a l'oreal bronzer which is very similar
6:06our packaging to this but it's just the whole the whole thing
6:09so when I saw this abuse the other day i was like wow I'm going to try this out i
6:12haven't actually used it before today today was the first time I used it but i
6:17really like it's a really nice color it is kind of orange and times if you avoid
6:22that at all costs
6:23this might not be the color for you but I don't mind it because i feel like it
6:27kind of adds a bit more walk to my face it blend really nicely
6:31hopefully it lasts all day on first impressions I was really impressed
6:36the only thing i will say is I didn't use this
6:39the highlighter and I feel like it's very narrow unless you have the world's
6:44skinniest brush I feel like it's going to be a possible to get that separately
6:49to this if you want to do it in one big swipe which i'm not sure i'm brave
6:53enough for and it might work really well but if you're trying to go contour and
6:58highlight separate I feel like this could make life a little bit tricky for
7:01you
7:02for blush i use this which is the revlon racy Rose blush
7:06it's a really gorgeous pink shade kind of like a deep pink actually which I
7:12wasn't so sure would go
7:15I feel like you can overdo the pink so i only put a little bit of this on
7:20but it blend really nicely it looks really pretty it's quite subtle it's not
7:24hugely hugely pigmented but for the price and the actual product I think
7:31it's really really good and worth looking into
7:35it's also not too much more shimmer so if you're after something that literally
7:39just put color on your cheeks
7:40I think this would be perfect for highlights I used my tart skin
7:45twinkle lightning palette which actually came out in the same collection as the
7:49foundation which is rain forests of the sea
7:51the packaging is so beautiful and I mean just look at that
7:56three amazing highlighters have this one which is a bit more in champaign
8:02this one which has a slight more kind of peach undertone and then you have this
8:07one which is a little bit more shimmery and a little bit more pink
8:10I am loving this at the moment i would highly recommend it it is beautiful
8:15actually reaching for this over my hourglass ambient lighting palette which
8:21is saying something
8:23i also really like it it's called skin wrinkle oh what's that on your cheek
8:27bone all just a bit skin twinkle like all highlighted sheets just be called
8:31skin twin clothes for do my eyeshadow I of course applied and eyeshadow primer
8:35this is the Urban Decay anti-aging eye shadow primer potion love this
8:40this is lasted me so long to be honest I probably should buy a new one because
8:43i'm not too sure how long these things last before they don't work to the best
8:48of their abilities basically kind of foolproof
8:50pull over on your finger rub it into your eye and I just find my eyeshadow
8:55last well blends well and looks better
8:59next thing I did was my eyebrows now i know i'm in need of a threading session
9:04not myself
9:06I let someone else do it so I did have a few little stray hairs and I also find
9:09it slightly more difficult to fill my brows in after I've had my brows up a
9:13couple of weeks after I've had my brows done because I get them tinted tip
9:17always get your brows tinted
9:19holy crap it makes life so much easier if you've never done it before try it
9:22I went to Space NK recently I had a little splurge
9:26huh and i was looking in the cabin a quant section because i have a few of
9:30their products and i really like them especially that - I shadows hope they're
9:35amazing
9:35so it's very and i picked up this which is the precision brow pencil because as
9:41you guys know I really love my brow pencils especially when they say
9:44precision because it means they're teeny-tiny and you can kind of replicate
9:48has in your eyebrows and they look more natural basically you twist it and
9:53you've got the little pencil nib and then on the other end which is what
9:58basically sold it to me
9:59is a little lid and a little eyebrow brush
10:03I don't own an eyebrow brush right now I don't quite know what happened there
10:07so I was like okay great this is basically an all-in-one you can brush
10:11through your brows either if you put too much pencil or just to kind of get the
10:15shape right and then use pencil
10:18recently I've been kind of venturing out of my total pages golds and I've been
10:24going for more kind of pinky barry x
10:26I don't really know why i have not done this more I don't know I just thought
10:30maybe they don't go with my eye color but then I thought screw it i'm just
10:32gonna wear it and see what it looks like and I really liked it
10:35I used the easy on the i-17 palette for the main color and it was this one which
10:43doesn't have a name
10:44oh yes it does I apologize
10:47the color i used all over the lid was number seven which is toasted almond
10:52I do you know what this color is really hard to describe it's like her
10:56it's like a dusky pink mixed with a bit of taupe and I really liked it so I
11:01popped that all over the lid these eyeshadows are actually really good
11:06and this is a really affordable palette so if any of you are after something
11:09which has kind of a really good selection of colors and an eye primer
11:15then check that out for the rest of the colors i used to the eyeshadows in this
11:20which is the Too Faced chocolate bon bons palette
11:24can I just say to face make the cutest packaging
11:30I've ever seen I literally love everything to face bring out because
11:33they just make it look so cute and it's free consented
11:38not that anyone's going to sniff your eyelids and go all chocolate scented
11:43eyeshadow but you know it's just a nice little like a treat when you to your
11:47eyeshadow award for cutest packaging for sure
11:51goes to two faced I know it's not everyone's cup of tea but i really like
11:54in the corner of my eye I used this gorgeous shade called sprinkles which is
11:58basically a shimmery baby pink which is normally I would be terrified to use but
12:02i think it works really well with this
12:04I look then
12:05in the crease of my eyes I used the one underneath which is a brown with a hint
12:12of berry tone matte color called bordeaux and I just feel like that gives
12:17the I little bit more definition and i also run that underneath my bottom lash
12:22line and then used satin sheets which is this gorgeous pinky highlight shade
12:27I'm just under my brow bone and in the very corners of my eyes is to brighten
12:31everything up a little bit highly recommend this color and all to face
12:35eyeshadows to be honest they are beautiful
12:37I didn't really want to make this too heavy and do a quid liner cat I so just
12:42to give my top eyelid and my top eyelid to give my top lash line a little bit
12:47more definition i just use the Urban Decay 24-7 glide on pencil
12:51this is actually a duo pencil which is perfect for travel because you've got
12:55black on one side and you've got a really nice matte brown on the other
12:58hand i used the brown just because i find it looks a little bit softer and it
13:03lends out a little easier and it doesn't look so harsh and that is called whiskey
13:09for my mascara i used this which is the Loreal fall / sculpt
13:14so I was said this not too long ago and I used it has this funny little like
13:19crocodile nip
13:20I think I might have put it in a favorite I can't remember I love this
13:24it's quite similar to the Maybelline one that I'm obsessed with but I feel like
13:28this is just super quick
13:31i'm not sure like with a lot of the scar is where you find yourself layering you
13:36don't do that with this
13:37it's like one code and you're pretty much good to go
13:40it says for extreme sculpting effect fibers
13:43it's very thickening and volumizing it doesn't necessarily add a lot of length
13:50but I find that because quite often it goes on the eyelashes at once
13:55it doesn't lift them and I used to just put like one coat of this on
14:00maybe a second just to you know separate the lashes look
14:03bit i will say if you don't like a sort of clumping mascaras i know most people
14:10don't like clumpy mascara but you know what i mean like a lot of people like
14:13that I like that because it's thickening and it's quick and I don't have the time
14:17to have like seven layers of mascara
14:20if you like that you'll love this if you hate that don't go near this because it
14:25is quite a clumpy thickening mascara
14:29however i love it onto my lips so I like my lips with this which is the
14:36colour-pop lippie pencil again slightly difficult to get hold of color pop in
14:41the UK but if you can
14:43the products are so worth it i love all their lip products I'm obsessed with
14:47them and this basically it's just a really lovely creamy lip liner I find
14:51their lip liners are the best lip liner ever
14:54they have the biggest variety of colors you've ever seen in your life and they
14:58just work really really well
15:00lipstick this is the lipstick that I wore a couple of videos back and all of
15:03you were like what is your lipstick but this is it
15:07it's a Smashbox lipstick and it is in the shade
15:10panorama pink and it's just this beautiful
15:13i would say it's like a cross between a Barbie pink and a baby pink
15:18it's somewhere in the middle which is why i think i really like it because i
15:21don't own any other colors like this
15:24in fact my lipstick draw is really lacking on the pink shades so I know
15:28what I'm gonna be doing
15:29whenever I go shopping now is looking at the pink lipstick I really like this
15:32much works lipsticks
15:33normally you guys know I'm much more of a matte lipsticks kind of girl
15:37but this has a really gorgeous moisturizing machine and they feel so
15:44luxurious on the lips
15:45they last really well obviously not as long as it would if it was a matte
15:49lipstick
15:49it gives a really gorgeous healthy look your lips but still have the
15:53pigmentation which i find is a really hard balance to get because normally a
15:58matte lipstick will have the best pigment you've ever seen
16:00and then you'll find that moisturizing lipstick doesn't quite have that same
16:04color payoff but these really do and I love
16:07listen and then just have an option on top if you want to or you don't have to
16:12i decided to just put this or just to show you what i wanted to kind of bring
16:16that the tone of pink down slightly
16:18so I popped on a little bit of lip gloss this is a l'oreal cream lip gloss in 101
16:24girl on top and it's just a really gorgeous kind of Milky baby pink and you
16:30can just add that on top for a bit more machine or just to kind of bring the
16:33color back down slightly
16:35i really like these i like the applicator is really interesting and
16:39kind of glides over your lips I think they've designed it so that it feels
16:43really comfortable to just sit over your lips as your player and they smell
16:48amazing
16:49so that is my pinky makeup look I really hope you guys enjoyed this style of
16:54video as i said before let me know if you want me to do another one
