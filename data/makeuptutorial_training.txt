5:06let's do this I woke up like this
5:09literally I did so I don't make a cute butt like this is reality so all right
5:14so my eyes are already primed
5:16i use mac pro longwear concealer in the shade and w22 prime my eyelids and my
5:21eyes look so tiny today's and so puffy from my allergies I feel like I'm like
5:25the first color that I'm going to go in with is this one right here second down
5:29second from the left
5:30it is a nice warm kind of medium brown so I'm gonna be using that as my
5:34transition shade
5:35I'm taking out on and what it isn't e-40 brush from sigma this is one of my
5:38favorite brushes for blending ought to use it all the time
5:42I'm going to take this color and windshield wiper motions and i'm going
5:44to go all the way from ER corner to the inner corner
5:48you guessed it when I go with my transition color i always like to go
5:51back and forth and a straight line like this to kind of car out the crease and
5:55then once I've done that back and forth and then start going in really small
5:59circular motions back and forth because that will really take any harsh line and
6:04blend it upward into my brain and you can see better
6:08okay here we go Oh give me some now i'm going to go with the shade right here
6:12which is super similar to this one that we just went in with but this one is a
6:15little bit darker so it'll give us just a little bit more dimension and increase
6:18of our I this color reminds me so much of mac texture which is one of my
6:23favorite shades from a collection of my favorite of all time
6:27that's why i love this color so again to be the exact same thing i'm going to put
6:30this color in the crease of my eye and then once we have it carved out back and
6:35forth I will then start blending and circular small motions upward
6:39so now i'm going to go in with this color as well this color the shade and
6:43this one all are very similar which is like light medium and dark
6:46curr these two colors right here are literally such great do so for max
6:51saddle in that texture which are like one of my two favorite I shall I was
6:54ever so I love both of these shades and with all three of these colors i'm
6:58seriously doing the exact same process I'm not switching up anything with all
7:03three of these colors and just want to kind of pile them on top of each other
7:05because it just gives such a smooth blended look when you're done and just
7:09adds a lot of dimension as opposed to just going with one shade and buffing it
7:12out instead you have this palette filled with 28 different colors like why not
7:16use as my son as you can right now i'm going to be going with the shade right
7:20here which is just like the most beautiful chocolaty goodness color I'm
7:24going to pick that up on a what is this morphy and 503
7:28I think this is just one of their new lennie rushes that can happen
7:31I love it going to continuously go back in and pack this on the outer crease and
7:37then work it upward and bring it in with the rest of the colors that we have in
7:41this upper crease area
7:44I love this brush then we'll do is go back with this color blue
7:54I'll go back with the same 44 should i started with you can take any of these
7:57three colors i'm going to take this one that reminds me of not texture and i'm
8:01going to go back in windshield wiper motions because this is a huge key in
8:05blending is just going over things especially once you've added dark shades
8:09going back in with a little bit of a lighter shade back and forth just to
8:13make sure that all of that is blended together and so we have no seems ok so
8:18now i'm going to go in with my favorite color in the palette and as this bad boy
8:22right here
8:22so taking that on this brush i'm just going to put it all over my entire lid
8:27and i am giving myself a lot of fallout right now and what I mean by that is i'm
8:33allowing a lot of shadow fall on my cheeks which i'm ok with I could go in
8:37with less product and i want to
8:39happen but I don't care if I'm not wearing foundation or anything yet so
8:42I'm just going to the generous amount of products and packing this on and then
8:46I'll clean up that under eye area in a minute
8:48what I will also do with my cotton rounds when I'm cleaning my under eyes
8:51I'll take it off fold them in half like this but we have a a line right here and
8:55then I will take back and I will follow up word and that will sharpen up that I
9:00look that we have going on it so i will just again take this folded and just go
9:04upward and then it will sharpen up that eyeshadow like so now to finish off the
9:10top one of our i am going to put a coat of mascara on my eyelashes and mascara
9:15will do for this because we're not going to make it look pretty we're trying to
9:19darken them so we can put false lashes on
9:22oh my goodness Georgie you can totally go in and apply false lashes right now
9:26but I'm just not wanting to apply false lashes yes I'm going to wash my face and
9:30then I will come back to my lashes towards the end
9:33I'm going to prime my face using Smashbox photo finish primer water which
9:36i've been loving recently so i'm going directly based on this i'm going to try
9:43the foundation okay i have not used this yet this is the new nars is called all
9:48day luminous weightless foundation gonna test this out how I like it
9:53me and bring you a little bit for this because you going to be all of my growth
9:56my foundation
9:58my hair's look so good today you guys going to use a Sigma f80 to apply the
10:06foundation and I know nothing about this foundation yet so I'm just going to see
10:10how it wears on my face and yes I know it looks like I'm painting on jaundice
10:14but look understand me
10:17i am not matching my foundation to my face if I did it would not look good i
10:21can promise you I match my foundation to my neck and a lot of people make
10:25comments about my foundation being too yellow but listen this is the call of my
10:28neck is so I'm going to match my neck to my face and when it all comes together
10:32it looks ok
10:34I've been excited to try this because it has the word luminous in it
10:39in the fact that is long wearing I'm looking forward to seeing how this
10:43where's throughout the day
10:50I'm not going to set my under eye area i'm going to use anastacio banana and
10:55mac pro emphasize and i'm going to make the mix those two together
10:59I cannot talk today i got up really early and I can talk a lot of sleep so
11:03just like don't want me as i set my under eye area with this highlighting
11:06powder i like to go up towards my temple because this will just give more they
11:10lifted appearance to the base
11:12I'm going to my under eye area now because I cannot stand seeing myself
11:15with like all the shadow of the top of my list of my under-eye totally like
11:19first I want to go ahead with a pencil brush just like this and i'm going to go
11:23in with really any of these three brown shade that we would initially I want to
11:26take this one right here i'm going to take this and go all along the lower
11:31lash line and because this is a very blown out
11:34rounded smokey eye I really am NOT going to focus on making this too perfect
11:39ok so now i'm going to take the e 15 from sigma the flax fibre brush I'm
11:43going to go back in with this chocolaty shade so everything even the top line
11:46we're not meeting on the bottom lid
11:48I'm going to do this color I'm going to press it really tight along my lower
11:51lash line
11:59I'm going to go back and blend out afterwards of course because every time
12:03i go of the dark shade have to go back and let it out
12:06way to go in with black eye kohl and this is the RNC in monster black
12:11eyeliner i mention this liner many times before is my favorite black eyeliner
12:14ever is so creamy and rich in pigment it's amazing
12:19so I'm going to line my entire water line top and bottom
12:27I was going to let that black I pulled just kind of sit there for a minute and
12:33i'm going to go in and do my eyebrows the way I've been filling in my brows
12:36recently as i start in the inner corner and I make a dark line all in the bottom
12:41part of my brow and then I just kind of flick upward and then that is it
12:45I haven't been doing much to the top of the ground I just start at the bottom
12:48and click upward and then that's all i've been going for a little bit more of
12:53a natural brow recently not natural whatsoever but just not as bold and used
12:59to fill the man now i'm going to be highlighting my brow bone and the inner
13:02corner of my eye and I'm going to be using this shade right here
13:05very first you the palate we're going to do is I'm going to take that color i'm
13:08just going to put it at the high point of the brow bone right here
13:12ok so now i'm going to apply false lashes i'm going to be using this brand
13:18I got in the mail and I don't have pronounced it crown
13:21milady I'm not quite sure i will sit down below course my description bar and
13:26they look like this and they are full and they're fluffy and their the
13:30luminous
13:30this is really going to give us a big extra on top lid
13:34I'm sorry but I just can't talk about applying false lashes like it just does
13:38not work
13:38this is one awkward by doing talk throughs because there's some things
13:41that I do that I can't talk through like applying my lashes I cannot talk about
13:47an appointment
13:47lashes I cannot talk when I'm doing eyeliner i do certain things I cannot
13:50open my mouth and I'm doing it because it's just like it throws me off
13:54I personally think that it's like a must to put mascara on your lashes look like
13:58this because we have such dark volume eyelashes on our top lid I really kind
14:02of want to match that replicated on the lower lash line as well
14:05otherwise your eyes , kind of squint easy now i'm going to contour my cheeks
14:08and i'm going to be using the Kat Von D shade light palette and I'm going to go
14:12in this middle color right here and i'm also using the brush that she sells for
14:17this kit as well i'm going to be using the contour and the brush and go in with
14:22that shape
14:32ok so this foundation is not working for me like at all
14:36it is sitting on top of my skin do you see how blotchy
14:40everything is it can't be this much work it because i have been loving this
14:45contour kit
14:46I don't know what to do to make this look better
14:52i'm going to apply blush i'm going to be using Mac margin which is when my kicker
14:56blushes ever
14:58I'm just going to buy that the apples of the cheeks and blend it backward then
15:06i'm going to highlight my cheekbones and i'm going to be kicking it old school
15:10with married women either by the ball i haven't used in so long I thought my
15:14baby today I wasn't why I love you
15:17what I'm going to go in and highlight the tops of my cheekbones with this for
15:26my lips I'm going to use my favorite nude lip combination ever which is the
15:29butter cream lipstick that i created with dr cosmetics all
15:33i just opened up a brand-new two bandits excel freshly yes
15:46i'm going to go over that make sure our cosmetics shimmer of hope
15:49lip gloss I'm just going to set this with urban occasion makeup setting spray
15:59because God knows we need it
16:03so we are all finished and this is the completed look right here and I honestly
16:11just have to talk about this because typically I would not mention this
16:15because i like to only talk about the positive here on my channel but because
16:18i tried this foundation on camera I feel like I'm just kind of obligated to give
16:22up my opinion and I'm just gonna be honest I'm really disappointed and hope
16:27is the point is foundation i think that makes sense
16:30I was so excited to try this because it says right here in the title of it said
16:34weightless aluminous long wearing foundation so I was like yes it is not
16:39making my skin luminous it honestly feels very dry out my skin
16:42it's cleaning and settling in every single little teeny tiny fine line
16:46I want to get up close in the mirror my skin actually looks kind of old it looks
16:51like i've never seen it before so I don't know and then when I went in with
16:54the power to contour this foundation look like grabbed onto the powder
16:59contour and i can not let you out so I feel a very blocky especially right here
17:04like I'm going to try to like it though i am going to try to mix it with oil and
17:08cream contour instead and maybe if i use it with creams maybe I like it better so
17:12we'll see
17:12well let me know how you guys do about this foundation in the comments down
17:15below if you try to I would love to know maybe those of you with oil your skin
17:18prefer it better because i am tried that could be a reason why it's cleaning so
17:22much to my skin and like everything on
17:24so let me know let me know if you guys have any tips or people like they're not
17:27and i will wear this for the rest of the day and in my opinion changes on I by
17:31the time of this video I will
17:32I'll put it down in the description bar i'll let you know if for some reason it
17:35starts looking like a beautiful of an hour from now i'll let you know
17:39so that's it thank you so much for watching this video i love you guys and
17:43I'll see you soon
0:25hey guys great things from my home to yours and come to my first holiday
0:31makeup to market oh I'll jokes aside i am so excited to be coming this video
0:35because i have not done a makeup tutorial like a fun one and quite a
0:41while so it's it was fun sitting down today coming to look for you and thank
0:44you so much to everyone who left me comments and tweeted me and gave me
0:48inspiration for this makeup tutorial i have seen it so many great suggestions
0:52for making books i am officially in the holiday spirit
0:55actually that's a total lie rewind not a holiday spirit
0:59but i'm in the makeup holiday look spirit you know what I mean
1:03still not ready to put the tree but I'm ready to beat my face and a lot of
1:09people were actually requesting warm smoky eyes like cranberry smokey eyes
1:12and or smoky eyes and incorporating ready now like you just come to mama
1:17like like a fiend like needs her fix when it comes to those warm smoky eyes
1:20but i actually saw one comment that asked for a olive green and gold smokey
1:26eye and it had like a couple hundred thumbs up and if i don't know if that
1:29home and just spoke to me and I was like yes I don't know if I've done a golden
1:34like an olive green sake I have it's definitely been a long time so I thought
1:38it was time to do one
1:39all green is one of my favorite colors like we're in clothing i absolutely love
1:43it especially like a dark dark forest green love it don't ask why are all my
1:47style is kind of weird can you hear my channel you'll get used to it
1:50promise and he fires in no time takes a minute to get used to me but we'll get
1:53there anyways
1:54all babbling inside this is the look that I came up with thank you so much
1:58for the suggestions you guys gave me because it's because of you that I come
2:00up with this look and I just absolutely love it
2:03I wanted to make it smoky bags and I want to make it like level 10 smoky
2:06because I feel like
2:07thanksgiving in the time to be drag queen status for me personally and you
2:11know that that's like a big thing is not always all about my Queens but
2:14Thanksgiving even though I want to do a smokey eye i like to keep it like a
2:17little bit more fresh than I would for something that New Year's e or even
2:22Christmas i did you can be an open top and glittery and fun but for
2:25thanksgiving it's like I'm spend the day with my family i'm eating the food i'm
2:28drinking good wine and so even though i wanted to do a smokey eye i did put a
2:33cream eyeliner on my waterline because I didn't want my eyes to look like too
2:38small to close in to smokey so if you're ever wondering why would apply a cream
2:44liner to your lower water line at the post leading it just completely blank
2:47it's because it will open up the eyes to make them look much more fresh awake and
2:51why
2:51so if you have small eyes to begin with it's a great tip to always put cream
2:55liner in there and will really make your eyes pop and so whenever I did the dark
2:59smoky eye and I want to really make sure that you can still see my eyeballs and
3:03not just the colors on my lid
3:05I will line my waterline I have a hard time talking to you Madeline Madeline I
3:09will win that will hold you going
3:12I'm done ok it's been a long day thank you so much for watching and stick
3:16around me

3:30to subscribe if you want to see any upcoming festive holiday look so thanks
3:35for watching guys I'll see you soon bye
3:39ok so today I'm going to be starting with my face is personal preference you
3:44can start with the skin eyes whatever you're comfortable with
3:46but today i want to start with my skin so i'm going to go in with the marc
3:50jacobs undercover coconut primer I really been loving this recently and
3:54then for foundation and concealer you're going to see the same routine that I've
3:57done in the past two videos because of the fact that i am moving to a new
4:01filming space right now my entire makeup collection is over there and I've been
4:05organizing it so i only have like the basic everyday essentials when it comes
4:09to my skin at my house right now so that's why you're seeing the exact same
4:13routine as the past two videos so i am mixing d cogiendo aqua foundation with
4:18the mac moisture SPF 15 5
4:20station and then blending them together i'm going to be applying it with a tart
4:25face kabuki brush and then for my concealer i am using the of course
4:30urban decay weightless naked concealers and my favorite concealer ever and i
4:34actually
4:35oh my gosh using my Chicago accent come out I said he actually
4:38well anyways I actually ran out of my color in the middle of this video and
4:44that's why you see me using that lighter shade
4:46I am typically light/medium neutral and I ran out of it so you saw me just go in
4:51with the streetlight one I usually use that one to highlight so i put that on
4:55the forehead and the chin as well to balance out the under eye area if I
4:59apply a light considered to the under eye area i always want to even out by
5:02applying to the forehead and the chin as well to make it look a little bit more
5:05natural
5:06so now i'm just going to be setting my under eye area i am using the Anasazi of
5:10Beverly Hills banana powder and i'm going to lightly dust that in the entire
5:14under eye area so that nothing creases and then i'm going to be going in with
5:18one of my favorite eye shadows of all time and this is my mac and it's called
5:21an interrupted it is a pro longwear eyeshadow and i'm applying it with a
5:26more fee for 41 brush and just dustiness in my entire crease area i'm really
5:31going to hula hoop the entire upper lid of the eye
5:34all the way from inner corner to outer corner since we're going to be applying
5:36dark shades on both inner and outer corner today I want to make sure that we
5:40start by putting a nice color in that crease and blending upward as you can
5:44see this is not blending out perfectly it's a little choppy in the crease area
5:49which I was not happy with
5:51I want my crease to be a very blended I don't want any harsh lines I want
5:55nothing to be choppy so I did decide to go in with a little bit of makeup geek
5:58desert sands
6:00this is basically like an interrupted little sister it's very similar to the
6:05color it's just a little bit lighter and shape so I just grabbed that color and
6:08then i went over top of it and as you can see it begins to blend out much
6:12smoother if you ever have an issue with an eyeshadow not blending out it's
6:15always a great idea to grab just one shade lighter of the similar shade and
6:19go over it and then that will help blend out any harsh lines
6:22now i'm going to be going in with dirty martini eye shadow again by makeup geek
6:27I love this eyeshadow so much it is such a beautiful olive green color I could
6:31just throw this all over my lid and put on
6:33something liner and be satisfied so I'm now going in with the morphe and 443
6:38brush this is one of my favorite blending brushes but as I got the inner
6:42corner of the eye I realized it was a little too fat for what I wanted to do
6:46you could make it work but because i had this brush i decided to go in with this
6:50one instead
6:51and this is the Sigma e45 it's just a much more small precision blending brush
6:56and it just fit that in her corner way better
6:58so again on the outer corner of the eye i will begin to pack that and kind of
7:02blend it upwards but more than anything we're just concentrating on really
7:05packing on that color so that it's nice and rich and then kind of blending it
7:09into the socket of the crease and then as we move forward I will trade out that
7:13morphe brush for the Sigma e45 to make sure that I get that color nice and
7:18precise on the inner corner
7:19you could use a q-tip for this and then you could blend it out with like the
7:22morphe blending brush
7:23you don't need to use both brushes but because i have them both
7:27I wanted to use them both because it made it easiest for me so now I'm
7:30grabbing that original brush and I'm going back in with mac on interrupted
7:33and i'm going to put that in the crease because we are working with this matt
7:37all of green we don't want it to get muddy and dirty looking so we're going
7:40to make sure that we continue to go back in with that original shade to keep that
7:44crease looking nice and warm and blend it out because we don't want to bring
7:48that all of green up too high
7:50so now we're going to go in with an even darker green and this is called
7:53enchanted forest
7:55oh my gosh this color is so gorgeous it's just a much darker version of the
8:01original all agree that we went with so using that same Sigma e45 I'm going to
8:05pack that mainly on the outer corner you can put on the inner corner if you want
8:09as well but i really wanted to concentrate on the outer corner and then
8:12again i will go in with a little bit more of an interrupted on the brush and
8:16blend that out we really want to keep the Greens low because if you bring them
8:19up too high on the lid
8:21that's when it can start to look like a little bit like a bruise and we know
8:24that a bruised is not cute on anybody
8:26so now we are going to be going in with a foiled eyeshadow by makeup geek and
8:29this is in the shade gesture and i have recently fallen in love with this color
8:34and it is a really beautiful olive green with some gold reflex and it and so I am
8:39using a mac 242 brush to apply this is a synthetic flat brush so any synthetic
8:44flat brush will work for this
8:45I'm going to focus his color mainly on the center of the lid and then blend it
8:49out to the sides and I'm initially going in with this drive i will spritz my
8:53brush and a moment with some mac fix+ if you don't have to explain you can use
8:57eye drops and that will work pretty much just the same
8:59i'm going to make sure I really focus that wet brush right on the center of
9:02the lid to get a really nice metallic sheen
9:05this is a great trick if you want to make your eyes look bigger and rounder
9:07so if you have small eyes
9:10this will be a great tip for you with any shadows any colors to really make
9:14sure you concentrate the color in the center of the eye and then I was taking
9:17a little bit more of that initial olive green and popping in the inner corner
9:20because I felt like gesture was kind of overpowering it and I didn't want to
9:24lose that inner corner depth darkness that we had
9:27now i'm going to fill in my brows basic we've seen this a million times before
9:31and I actually ran out of my color and the Anasazi a brow is right as i went to
9:36apply it and you know that moment we were just like no my brows shut a quick
9:41tier and move on
9:42so i'm actually using a color from my back stock that is not my right shade
9:46but we're just going to see past that right
9:48we can pass it was the look is done it's fine looks a little weird now but it'll
9:51be fine
9:52so I am using Mac nylon as my brow highlight today because this is my
9:56favorite brow highlight ever as like a nice yellow sheen to it and it is frosty
10:01as can be so at last you forever because the tiniest bit goes such a long way I'm
10:06going to put that right on the top of the brow bone of blend out a little bit
10:09we're going to move on to the lower lash line
10:11so I'm going initially with enchanted forest which is that super super dark
10:15green
10:15i'm going to apply that only on the outer half of the eye and now i'm going
10:19to do is I'm going to go in with the lighter green which is dirty martini and
10:23i'm going to put that on the inner half of my eye so it's almost like an ombre
10:27effect and we have the darker color and the outer corner because we did the same
10:30thing on the upper lid
10:31we put a chance of force that dark green on the outer and we left the inner
10:35corner with just dirty martini so I kind of wanted to have that same effects of
10:39kind of an ombre under eye and then using a pencil brush I'm going to grab a
10:43little bit of that mac and interrupted and just begin to blend it out because I
10:46never want harsh lines on the under eye area i always wanted to have the same
10:50effect as the upper lid so I like to make sure that it's really nice and
10:53smoky and blown out
10:55that's why we go in with a pencil brush and
10:56better color now i'm going to go in with the mac chromatographic pencil and NC 15
11:01/ nw20 which is just an amazing cream liner and it doesn't bother my eyes my
11:06eyes are very sensitive
11:07it's going to line my waterline to really make my eyes stand out especially
11:11since i have blue / green eyes
11:13my eye color can easily get lost with this makeup look so this trip
11:17this trick will make my eye color kind of stand out and not get lost with all
11:20the other green tones and I'm just popping a little bit of nylon highlight
11:24on the inner corner as well to match the brow bone because the interop highlight
11:28is something i can't skip and then i'm going to go in with the Laurier laurier
11:31laura mercier translucent setting powder and i'm going to be using an e3 brush
11:37from morphe just to dust this over my entire face this is a trick that I do to
11:42make my bronzer on my contour my blush and highlight just go on very very
11:46smooth so it's not patchy at all
11:49then I'm going to go in with all my gosh you guys these lashes these are the new
11:52lashes by the Lord lashes and they're sold exclusively at sephora and I
11:56actually think they're launching today but they sent them to me early and this
12:00is the style fluff in wispy a whole my gosh they are probably one of my face
12:06actually all my favorite lashes I've ever used before so i'll try to find it
12:10and link it down below for you guys if they are available in a very dramatic
12:13but they are amazing and I'm going to cut my lower lashes with some mascara i
12:18use mac extended play lash because my favorite lower lash mascara along with
12:23the room i lash accelerator and then i'm going to bronze my face using a bobby
12:27brown bronzer I believe this is a golden one golden light one maybe
12:32and i am using one of my favorite contour brushes at the moment this is
12:35the morphe 523 brush
12:37I don't know what was technically made for but i've been using it for contour i
12:40absolutely love it because it gives a really easy kind of soft contour much
12:43softer than like the NARS eat a brush which I love as well but this one I just
12:47feel like a softer and easier and not as harsh and I don't know I go through
12:52moments where I want really harsh contours and softer ones
12:55speaking of a harsh contour i'm going to take just a little bit of that laura
12:58mercier translucent powder and i'm going to use a really intense angled brush
13:02from morphe this is the 459
13:05I'm gonna let that sit there for a few minutes
13:07i'm going to just dust it off and i have course and setting my brows using
13:11anastacio clear brow gel AKA browse super glue
13:15more like gorilla glue because this stuff does not move and then i'm going
13:18to go in with a blush from the morphine 9b palette i still love this palette
13:22guys it's so good i'm going to use this blush this coral and top right corner
13:27it has a little bit of Sheen in it but it's not sparkly or glittery i'm going
13:31to apply that to the apples of the cheeks and i'm going to really bring it
13:35backward towards the cheekbones recently I've been into applying blush a little
13:38bit further back
13:39I feel like it pulls the face back a little bit more than putting it just on
13:42the apples of the cheeks
13:44I'm thinking about doing an in-depth video about blush contour baking
13:47highlight so let me know if you guys want to see that video and i'll be happy
13:49to do it for you and i'm going to just dust off that bake that we had sitting
13:54there that sounds so funny oh my gosh help me and then i'm going to apply
13:57champagne pop to my cheekbones using a morphy m5a1 brush
14:01I get asked all the time of my favorite brushes for highlight and it's
14:04hands-down the m500 one
14:05I absolutely love it i've been using it for months and it is my fav and i am
14:10going over with a second highlight because I'm just feeling you know
14:13so I'll see today i'm gonna pop some on my cupid bow and then I'm going to take
14:17a little bit of that same bronzer used to contour and just shadow my lower lip
14:21just to give a little bit more of a lower fuller lip effects even though my
14:25top lip needs the fullness let's get real about my bottom but let's move on
14:28for lipstick i'm going to be using house of dollars pretty MF
14:32and as you can see it's like a really really light orange kind of cream
14:35sinkhole and I don't love the way this looks on my skin tone personally maybe
14:39I'm just not used to seeing myself in it but i wanted to go over to kind of
14:42manipulate the color a little bit so I'm going to go in with a NYX butter gloss
14:46this is an oldie but a goodie and the shade maple blondie
14:49and i feel like these two colors mixed together are just like my dream come
14:53true for a Thanksgiving lip I just think it looks like a creamsicle creamy
14:58pumpkin pie i just love the shade that these to make together and it's nice and
15:03glossy and i just love a glossy lip
15:05so after we have that we're just going to set everything by using Urban Decay
15:09to makeup setting spray
15:10we use any spray you want or you can just be balls do not use any setting
15:13spray all mad respect to you and that's the end so i hope you guys enjoy
15:18happy thanksgiving from my family to yours
15:20love you guys so much and I'll see you soon
0:00hey guys so for today's video this is the most random video that i have been a
0:04really long time
0:05i'm going to be doing a first impressions video on the new Carly
0:09cosmetics cumshot oh I catch that was very clever up because shadow bronze
0:16eyeshadow palette
0:17this is so random and unexpected I was not planning on doing this I've actually
0:21had such a busy day and it is currently eight almost a 38-28 right now and i
0:27decided to take a quick body shower and run over here and from this video for
0:31you guys because I received this package in the mail today this was sent to me
0:35from Kylie cosmetics just so you guys know i received this package in the mail
0:38and I jumped on snapchat and show you guys some my finger swatches and showed
0:42you the packaging and the palate all that jazz
0:44and i asked you guys if you would like to see me uses in a video or do a first
0:48impression
0:48I'm not kidding I have so many snaps requesting it that my snap literally
0:53froze and shut down
0:54I went to Twitter when I swear that we're coming in so fast I could barely
0:58read them just from people asking to do a first impression and say thank you
1:01because i mentioned recently that I've just been kind of a rut
1:05I haven't been feeling inspired by am taking action to make changes in areas
1:08so that i can help get myself out of that but honestly you guys just seeing
1:12you so excited over an eyeshadow palette has really just made me so happy and you
1:16guys can just kind of like relive my excitement right now for makeup and
1:20that's why I'm here right now i am just like so happy to be doing this right now
1:24so appreciative and thankful for you guys and your excitement for makeup in
1:27general so I'm just happy to be here
1:30the first thing I want to say about this though is the same thing is on snapchat
1:32and on Twitter a couple of nights ago is the packaging itself slave my soul like
1:38when I saw Kylie's snapchat of this
1:40I didn't even care what was inside this box when I saw this Elvis up
1:43Oh God can you have to buy open up and like all shattered
1:46I would die I just think it is so cool and different
1:50can we talk about this like you talk about those this comes
1:54whatever you order the palate this comes in there with a little note on the back
1:58and I like I can't so this is what the palette itself looks like right here you
2:02can kind of get an idea for the side it's like a very small and compact
2:05carboard very extremely lightweight and on the back it has the shades right
2:10there it has her signature
2:11I think this is like the coolest concept right here it's like so simple but yeah
2:16it's like a very modern and edgy
2:18come on this is like of course we all saw this we were all like yes perfect I
2:23have watched this one this one this one this one these maps shades right here on
2:27my hand i showed you guys on snapchat
2:29I will say the swatches are very very promising but again that's just a finger
2:33swatch so we will see how it actually goes on the eyes
2:36I'm going to be completely and totally honest in this video I have absolutely
2:39no reason to lie to you guys I never have and I never will the data i start
2:42lying to you guys for any reason is the day that my mom will bend me over her
2:44knee and spank me and shut my channel down i will be totally honest with you
2:48guys about this as I always have been as I was honest about her liquid lipsticks
2:51when I first came out so i gotta put that disclaimer out there are no one's
2:54paying me I did receive these this palette for free from Kylie cosmetics
2:58and just got in today i am doing this video by request and that's all i have
3:01to say let's get started
3:03I don't have already mentioned but I do have my entire face a foundation
3:06concealer and powder so my base is already completely done
3:10we're going to go ahead and jump right into the eyes and the first cause i'm
3:13going to pick up is this one right here
3:14a warm medium matte brown I would compare this to something along the
3:18lines of like back saddle
3:20I'm going to be up on a fluffy natural hair brush
3:23guys I'm like anxious and excited to see how these apply and then just go ahead
3:32and put this right in the crease
3:35oh my gosh so far so good you guys
3:39I'm liking or what I am shading and it's even more so you can really see what I'm
3:46doing
3:47oh don't be scared now that I have this product on the brush I'm going to bring
3:51it all the way in to the inner corner because i am going to cover my entire
3:55lid with product today so I'll just lightly feather in their applying just
4:02like any other shadow that I like applies like it's applying similar to
4:07make a big shadow it's applying similar to Mac shadow to have to say on a
4:12different note I feel like
4:13back shadows have kind of gone down recently like it's not just need his
4:17I've start using more and more brands like my standards have gone higher but I
4:20feel like Max shadows used to be better especially the shimmers I don't know why
4:26but anyways
4:27not important ok so now i'm going to pick up this shade right above it which
4:31is a definitely a little bit more of a cool tone have a little more of a great
4:35undertone in it i'm gonna be using the exact same brush and this is the more
4:38feet and 4 4 1 by the way I'm going to go right over top of that now there's a
4:43little bit higher up in the crease but right over top of it
4:46this color is applying beautifully
4:51I mean since the first one apply beautifully i'm sure all the mounts will
4:55but you never know because sometimes in some pallets there's a lot of
4:58inconsistency like one that would be gorgeous and then that's one right next
5:01to it won't like blend you know I'm saying
5:04all right now I'm going to pick up the middle shade oh it is so pretty and that
5:08is in the shade
5:09sit trying side trying to trying likes tron tron so trying
5:14oh god I'm like an idiot going to take like a little less amount of it and I'm
5:19just basically going to like take my brush and go like this and just like dab
5:23a little bit of it down a little bit and it just that I haven't a little amount
5:28of products into my brush and then i'm going to very lightly with a more light
5:32hand go over that whole area just to give it that warmth and brightness in an
5:38orange shadow does
5:39oh yes Kylie I'm a I'm a little impressed not gonna lie
5:50I'm going to pick up a smaller blending brush it basically looks the exact same
5:54time as any to a bit smaller and this is the more p.m. 4 3 3 i'm going to go back
5:59and with that original color right here with and I'm just going to put a little
6:02bit on the brush and I'm not just going to press this kind of on my lid just
6:06like a light sweep to get that color
6:10I want us to basically be a matte look honestly you guys the shadows are
6:19blending and so well I mean you can see it on camera
6:23you know like you can't fake it you can see how well they're blending they're
6:27not choppy they're not strike either . patchy really impressed right now
6:32now i'm going to grab the shadow all the way down here and this is opposite Ian
6:37ok I'll come all these names for things i have no idea how to pronounce what
6:40time you go back to school and this is a really pretty like medium tone very warm
6:46rich reddish-brown reminds me of like a mac swiss chocolate
6:50so this one as I swirl my brush in this one it did have more pickup then the
6:53others right here but i will say i know just from other stuff
6:58um I'm working on that Reds are typically like that if you ever swatch a
7:02shadow that has a lot of red pigment in it and it kicks up a ton of shadow
7:06it's really really tricky to develop a red undertone um I shadows so it does
7:10have a lot of take back compared to the other one's gonna go ahead and put this
7:13out here and this has a nice pigment - I'm going to get a little bit more
7:20I don't fall out yeah this has a really nice pigment for a reddish shadow
7:27because again it's really hard to get good at pigmentation when you're working
7:32with red shades i know a lot of times and pallets i'll be so excited about the
7:36red color like the cranberry color and then when you actually go to use it
7:40it was like actually no pigment and it's just very tricky to develop red will say
7:45this one is not applying as easily and the other the others were so
7:51like worry free and so easy this one I'm having to kind of press it in a little
7:55bit more but again that's probably because of the red
7:59it has a little bit more fallout but still this is nothing I would like
8:04complain about this is just very standard to me you know this is the same
8:08as any other eye shadow brand
8:09so now for this part i am going to just bake my under-eye really quick i'm going
8:15to go in with the darker shades and I just don't want like any of it to fall
8:18out like the dark round the black to fall out and like mess up my foundation
8:22so I'm going to grab some translucent powder and a damp Beauty sponges if you
8:27do your foundation first and then you want to go in with dark shadows and
8:33you're scared that you're going to get all of your face this is just a way to
8:35make sure that you do not ruin your concealer and foundation because you can
8:39just sweep all the products away and you're good to go I mean you look a
8:43little bit like a freak while you're doing it but whatever
8:46alright so now i'm going to grab the middle shadow on the bottom and this is
8:49in the shade
8:50bronze aight and this again is Matt so far we have only worked with the matte
8:54shades and a brush I want to use for this I'm going to stick with the same
8:59exact Russia I've been using and I'm going to pack this on
9:03oh this is nice pigment i'm going to pass on just a tiny bit right on the
9:09lash line area and then just ever so slightly put any outer corner of my eye
9:15I don't want this to be too intense i'm going to keep it kind of light for this
9:20part you're not going to do you take just a small angle brush like this one
9:24right here going to dip in a translucent powder and i'm going to carve out
9:30I don't know if you guys ever seen you this before but this is a great trick if
9:36you want like a slanted katish type
9:38I but you don't want to use tape or you have on foundation already i'm just
9:43going to stamp it on there just like this and then
9:48and it will make it so that we wipe it away you have just like any media cat
9:51eye
9:58I'm going to go back and I'm going to grab a little bit of these two shades
10:01and mix them together a little bit of that warm brown and that one tiny amount
10:07on my brush not too much i'm going to blend out this harsh line right here on
10:11the edge just with tiny little wiggling motions
10:16now as you can see i'm slightly getting rid of my translucent powder that's okay
10:25you have to worry about that you can go back and grab a little bit more of it
10:29and just put it right over top that line and let it sit and it will just continue
10:33to erase anything that you bring down there right now I'm going to grab a
10:37pencil brush any pencil brush will do
10:40and then I'm going to go in with the black shade right here and this one
10:44looks like it's going to be super black
10:47I'm going to take this and I'm going to run it right along my lash line
11:00I am just dipping my brush like one dab into the black because i don't want to
11:05get tons and tons of fallout so when I pick up the black i'm literally going
11:08like poop like one thing and then tapping off the excess and you can see
11:14the pigment that gives
11:21ok so at this point i have used almost all the matte shades except i have not
11:25used this one just because i personally and not like matt white vanilla cream
11:30kind of girl i know that tons of people are which is why everyone's in their
11:32palates I'm not on for the purpose of this video I'm going to go in with a
11:37sugar color but typically I would just leave it like this and put on some
11:40lashes mascara and clean my brows and all that jazz but i'm going to use one
11:44of the shimmer so we can see how they apply and I don't know which one ordered
11:49I'm going to do this one it picks up nicely like I want to
11:52I'm grabbing it with my brush like it seems to pick up nice it doesn't have
11:55like doesn't get chunky or anything i'm going to go ahead and apply it right in
11:59here in the inner corner
12:02ok so i'm not getting much of anything on my eyes but I actually thought about
12:08this was applying the matte shadow beforehand because it most of the time
12:13when you apply a matte shadow before a shimmer shadow you don't get any color
12:19payoff and I thought about that as i was applying the matte shadow look at this
12:22was on just regular bare skin i wonder if it'd be different
12:25so what I'm going to do is I'm going to like prime back of my hand really quick
12:28and i'm going to apply it to my hand to see if it applies better because it
12:33might be because the fact that i just put a matte shadow down and then
12:37shimmers don't work i'm going to apply the exact same shadow that I just tried
12:41to apply on my legs I feel like I didn't give it like a fair chance i don't want
12:45to say that it's terrible before I try this
12:47so this is tiger eye again the same one that I used on my island i'm going to
12:51pick up the same amount on my brush right there and let's see if we apply it
12:55like this
12:56okay see now look now we're getting pigment like its supposed to have let me
13:02grab the other eye shadow wipe off my brush I'm going to grab the other
13:04shimmer and try
13:06okay see so they are showing up on my hand with a brush perfectly fine so I'm
13:14going to just say that the reason it's not showing up on my lid is because the
13:18fact that i use a matte shadow first i'm going to go back over which is a little
13:22bit more black eyeshadow because I just want to look to be smoky
13:26you know I figure if we're doing a first impression videos of eyeshadow like we
13:30get to do something dark and smoky and really see what the shadows can do right
13:35all right I'm just grabbing a brush and wiping away my under eye area to get rid
13:43of all that bacon judge and now you can see what that translucent powder did for
13:49my eyes how it made it like a nice slam right there see how it just cleans it up
13:54and gives you a cat eye
13:56it's a really nice tip can see it right there
14:00I'm just going to make this a little bit sharper facebook to learn that me and I
14:10was like wait a second
14:11this looked a little on the blender if you ask me
14:15okay i'm going to grab the middle shade right here and the very top it's another
14:20shimmer and it is in the shade courts
14:22i'm going to attempt to highlight my brow bone this don't know it's going to
14:25be too dark so let's try this one I don't know we'll find out
14:31oh yeah it works ok cool it's working
14:39I'm going over it with Jasper which is the light creamy matte shade
14:47I'm going to pop on a pair of lashes i have not tried yet
14:53and they are fluff and dolled up so by the lower lashes on my god dog up i used
14:58to wear those back in the day but these are like the newest silk version of them
15:03alright so now i have my lashes on and I'm so mad at myself and I was applying
15:07mascara
15:08I got it right here like a huge glob and I had trying to get rid of it and it's
15:13much my eyeshadows and my eye shadow looks like it's all like unblended my
15:18this is my actual name they're all right I'm going to grab a pencil brush this is
15:23like an old pencil brush from sedona lace from like years ago
15:27I'm going to grab the shade right here the warm kind of caramel brown shade i'm
15:32going to just put that right on my lower lash line
15:43now i'm going to take this reddish brown shade in the far corner and i'm going to
15:47put that right over top
15:53my the only person that doesn't really look at themselves like when they do
15:57this like they just feel for it and just look around the room
16:02I'm going to pick up a small definer brush like this right here and I'm going
16:05to dip into the black
16:07i'm going to put that just on the outer corner of my lower lash line
16:11I'm trying so hard not to make my face when I always do when i apply eyeshadow
16:22on my lower lash line
16:24Oh almost made it to that that was a lot of work
16:30i'm going to apply some mac coast outreach
16:33I pencil in my waterline because i think my wife looks a little bare
16:51alright so i just threw on some makeup obviously to finish off my luck but I
16:55figured you guys might want to see that because this video is about this bad boy
16:57right here right
16:58so i will say that my overall take away from this palette is that if you are
17:03looking for every day
17:05neutral basic palette just applied easily you're not looking for anything
17:08that
17:09- metallic not looking for anything that's too difficult or too bright or
17:12intense
17:13this would be the palette for you it is a great everyday like girl next door
17:17palette i will say for me personally I wish that he shivers had more of a pop
17:22more like a metallic miss to it but that's because i am secretly a drag
17:26queen insights
17:27I always apply my shimmers with mac fix+ or unless they're like a really intense
17:32already much how i like foil shadow
17:35I'll if i go on the shimmer our to be shimmer like I don't want a subtle
17:38shimmer I want like glitter
17:39you know um but some like my sister who just loved like that everyday look like
17:44she would love these shimmers because they have a nice color palette but
17:47there's a very subtle when I tried to apply it over my matte eyeshadow it did
17:52not work but honestly I was stupid for even trying to do in the first place
17:55I know better than that but when I prime my hand and put it on my hand with the
17:59brush
17:59they were beautiful so I honestly don't think that that's kind of how she
18:02intended it because the fact that there are so many more max there's only two
18:06shimmers in the nine color palette so everything that she didn't want you to
18:10be very vibrant and intense obviously because she made them a little bit more
18:14subtle post like a really intense like metallic creamy shimmery eyeshadow you
18:19know overall i would give this palette and a for sure i would get the packaging
18:24and eight plus this is sick nasty islands packaging so much and I was
18:28Kylie out of blow this image up like gigantic like the size of a wall and
18:32then put up my couch for my better something exciting is just so cool
18:35anyways I'm gonna stop rambling thank you so much for watching this video you
18:38guys I really hope that you enjoy
18:40I love you thank you so much for requesting this
18:42and I will see you in my next video bye
0:16hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look right
0:22here I told you guys that would be doing something different and colorful and
0:25smoky and this is exactly what i was referring to so I just want to say thank

0:39it wasn't for your request so thank you so much for that
0:42this look is structure it is intense and his dramatic is over the top
0:46I absolutely love it this look is for my Queens or more like a day-to-day neutral
0:51girl at times other tutorials for that and i'll be back with more than to look
0:54later but today we are feeling ourselves
0:58okay that's better lost my staff members like it
1:02I know the Blues can be intimidating but just don't forget to blend and take your
1:06time and all will work out I promise practice makes perfect and that my mom
1:10always said late at night before you wash your face just pull out your makeup
1:14brushes pull out your palate and just do your makeup provide minutes and if
1:17you're trying to learn new techniques like this lower last technique or a
1:20winged liner just try for five minutes every night
1:23it's just make up a white sauce you can just try it wipe it off try it wipe it
1:26off wash your face go to bed sleep on it try the next night you know what I'm
1:29saying if you do that for a few nights in a row i promise you can earn any
1:32technique that you want nothing is intimidating
1:35nothing is too hard to achieve a makeup you got this and remember it's just
1:39makeup
1:39you know I'm saying wipes right off and you can forget it ever happened
1:42enjoy the video i love you guys and I'll see you soon bye
1:45hello my loves my eyes already primed and i'm going to be going in with make a
1:51geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow i know i use this in the beginning of every
1:55single makeup look
1:56but it's so similar my skin tone going back and forth with this in my entire
2:00crease area just makes it so that no matter what colors I choose to go in
2:03with its going to blend easily
2:05now i'm going to go in with makeup geek unexpected this is the perfect
2:09transition color if you're working with blues or purple because the cool cool
2:14tone grayish purple is just perfect and it's matched so using that same Sigma
2:18e-40 i'm going to dust that back and forth all the way from the inner corner
2:21to the outer corner in the upper crease area
2:24now i'm going to go in with the star of the show and this is anastacio star
2:29cobalt this is a very intense metallic eyeshadow
2:32so when I apply this I pull my eyelid taught like you can see me pulling it
2:35there to really get all that pigment all over the entire lid and it gives a very
2:39shimmery look I'm going to make sure that i put this on the entire lower lid
2:43area but i do not want to go any further than my crease
2:47I want to keep this nice and low because the issue with colors like this is if
2:51you take it - hi all of a sudden that's when it becomes a mess
2:54so keep it low keep it on your lid and do not surpass your crease area
2:58now i'm going to go in with a sigma e25 brush and a little bit more of that
3:01unexpected eyeshadow and we are just going to begin to blend blend blend back
3:06and forth and windshield wiper motions all the way from the outer corner to the
3:09inner corner until you see that blue shade is no longer a harsh jagged line
3:14in the crease then i'm going to go in with mac blackberry eyeshadow
3:18this is just a few shades darker than unexpected which is why i'm going in
3:21with it because you want to start off with a lighter shade and then blend that
3:24and then go darker and then blend that you never want to just go in with a dark
3:28shade and expect that to blend out beautifully
3:30so you blend in between every single step and that is how you achieved a
3:34flawless blended smooth smokey eye that does not have any harsh jagged lines
3:38so once we have moved on from that step I'm going to take a makeup remover wipe
3:42and clean up the under eye and i will also use this to create kind of a cat I
3:47with that shadow
3:48it's a nice easy trick to kind of get that shape that you want that very
3:51sculpted I look and then i will go in with Maybelline gel liner and shader
3:55black is black and then just create a typical black winged liner
4:00the great thing about using and that makeup wipe to remove the excess and
4:03creating that harsh line as you can then follow it with your eyeliner so it makes
4:07it simple to do a wing
4:08now i'm going to go in with makeup geek poolside eyeshadow absolutely gorgeous
4:13I should have done this before my eyeliner but I didn't think about it and
4:16once my eyeliner was done I was looking in my eyes and I was like we need
4:18something else
4:19so taking the same brush this is the mac 242 that I used to apply the star cobalt
4:24i'm going to just tap this on the center of the lid and then blend out and as you
4:27can see it just gives the I much more dimension it just kind of brings that
4:30upper lid together then I'm just going to go over and fix my eyeliner and just
4:35kind of go over that and make it blacker because we completely messed up because
4:38I should have done that step first so if you are trying to throw us off at home
4:41do that part first then do your liner now I'm going to be applying lashes i am
4:45using house of lashes iconic these are my absolute favorite lashes at the
4:49moment I can't get enough of them
4:51I wear them every day I wear them with no liner liner a smoky eye a neutral I I
4:55swear they are just so gorgeous i'm in love with them right now we're going to
4:59go in and Prime at my skin and I am using makeup forever
5:01radiance primer using clean hands of course we're going to use this all over
5:05our entire face and then i'm going to be using a newer foundation today and this
5:10is by the brand LC cosmetics
5:12oh my gosh you guys I talked about this on snapchat I'm just so in love with it
5:16right now and i'm also going to be wetting my face with some mac fix+ the
5:20reason I'm doing this is because this LC foundation is definitely made for those
5:24of you who are more oily to normal
5:26maybe combination skin since I am dry I don't want it to be so Matt so i use a
5:31radiance primer and then i use a dewy skin missed or a mac fix+ just to give a
5:35little bit more of a glow to the skin because it will dry extremely mad on me
5:39i am using it be more foundation brush this is the m4 39 my favorite foundation
5:43brush right now it just smooths everything out so beautifully and
5:46because of the size and the density it just makes it so that you don't have a
5:49build up a foundation on the skin and you don't go overboard
5:52now i'm going to do with the under eye concealer of course I wanted a bright
5:57highlight today so i'm going to start off with using the Urban Decay
5:59weightless naked concealer i think it's called something like that you know what
6:03I'm talking about
6:03i'm going to use this in a triangle motion I'm going to take it down the
6:06sides of my nose and I'm going to drag it back toward the temple using a very
6:11damp Beauty Blender I'm going to blend that out word i'm bringing that down on
6:15the cheek area and then I'm going to take it all the way up to kind of
6:18emphasize the center of the cheeks and then up towards the temple to give that
6:21lift
6:22i'm also going to even out that highlight by putting it on the chin
6:25the upper lip the nose and the center of the forehead and then again go back with
6:30the damp beauty blender and blend that out using a damp Beauty Blender will
6:33make sure that you have tons of excess product it will pick it up and you don't
6:36have cake face that's why i love the beauty blender because like right there
6:39i put a little too much product in my upper lip but that's ok when you're
6:42working with the beauty blender because it'll pick up the excess and you're not
6:45going to have cake frosting see on your upper lip because that's not good on
6:48anybody
6:49i'm going to set my under eye concealer and i'm using a mac
6:51emphasize which is a pro product and i'm going to mix it with the anastacio
6:55banana concealer and i'm going to really highlight that under area again on the
6:59size of the nose the cheeks up towards the temple and then i will also set it
7:02on the chin
7:03the Cupid's bow the nose and a little on the forehead as well because we want to
7:07even out that highlight you're going to highlight you got a highlight do it all
7:11girl don't miss any spots
7:12now i'm going to go in and take care of dem browse i am using anastacio brow Wiz
7:18in the shade
7:20nope i believe and then once i have filled in my brows
7:23I as always use a little bit of concealer underneath that brow just to
7:26help carbon out and give it a little bit more dimension especially on the arch of
7:30the brow
7:31now i'm going to go in with mac shroom eyeshadow
7:34i'm going to use this to highlight the upper brow bone I absolutely love
7:38highlighting the brow bone especially when you're doing a smoky eye it just
7:41give that glamazon very bombshell look to the eyes and I just think that it is
7:47beautiful so I always make sure to highlight then i'm going to also
7:50highlight generously on the inner corner of the eye because the technique we're
7:53going to use on the bottom lash line is really going to pop with this highlight
7:58on the inner corner so I'm packing on that highlight and then i'm going to go
8:01in with the anastacio cream color and the shade ice blue
8:05she came out with i think five or six of these cream colors and they're so
8:09pigmented they are amazing
8:11I was nervous for putting on my waterline was going to irritate my eyes
8:13but it didn't it didn't burn it didn't sting is gonna irritate them which is
8:17surprising because I my eyes get so irritated so easily in this color like
8:21can we talk about it is so beautiful
8:23now i'm going to go in with mac navel this is a pro color so you can get on
8:27mac cosmetics , or at prostores is a very dark navy blue kind of purple shade
8:33it is more on the cool side which is different for me but that's why I chose
8:36it it's gorgeous and I love that it's a matte color so i am just using an angled
8:40brush as you can see i believe this is Action Anastasio brow brush technically
8:44but whatever
8:45moving on I'm gonna line this very tightly on the lower lash line and then
8:49once i get to that inner corner
8:50as you can see instead of sticking to my lash line going to cut it go down and
8:55create almost the effect of a cat I i do have a tutorial going in depth on this a
8:59little bit more i will link it down below it was my trendy i tutorial i
9:02believe it's called as you can see here
9:04i right i just was not as perfect as a left so I went in with a little bit of
9:08concealer on a definer brush and I just kind of clean it up
9:11we all make mistakes but it's okay it's just makeup you can clean up your
9:14mistakes and move on no one ever knows i'm going to just blend out that lower
9:17lash line using any pencil brush
9:19I don't really have any additional products on this I just kind of went in
9:22and blend it out I didn't want the bottom lash line to be too overly smokey
9:26I wanted it to be nice and defined but I didn't want to be too intense just like
9:29a jagged line
9:30I never like jagged lines let's get real i'm all about that blending life
9:34I'm gonna call my lower lashes with mascara and now i'm going to go in and
9:36contour today i'm going to be using if you make it forever bronzer and number
9:4030 and we are going to kick it old school baby with the NARS eat a brush
9:43oh I forgot how much I missed this brush you guys I love it so much if you want
9:48to structure contour i still stand behind this brush it is so amazing as
9:52you can see right here the proof is in the pudding
9:54it's just so easy to contour with it just makes such a beautiful line but
9:58because the bristles are nice and kind of fluff out
10:01it's not too intense and too harsh to the point that you're like oh dear god
10:04it's just an amazing brush i absolutely love it
10:07now i'm going to go in with blush and i am using a beka blush in the shade sweet
10:12pea
10:12and i'm going to be using the morphe for blush brush which by the way this is the
10:17first blush brush ever that has made me turn my back on the mac 129
10:20it is amazing I'll talk about more in depth later but I just absolutely love
10:25it
10:25now i'm going to carve out my contour i'm using the morphe 510 brush and any
10:30light powder that you have as long as it's matt will do for this
10:33put it right underneath that contour and then just wipe it away and that will
10:36help just kind of strength in your contour and make it look more structured
10:39so that it's not messy then taking a little bit of bronzer i'm going to put
10:43that right underneath the lower lip and it will help it look a little bit fuller
10:46and a little bit more pouty know all the tricks i decided to go back in with a
10:50little bit of black eyeshadow because I just felt like that inner corner wasn't
10:53popping enough for me
10:54so just taking a little bit of makeup geek corrupt i'm going to put that on
10:57that inner corner
10:58just for a little bit more of a pop then i'm going to highlight the cheeks and
11:02i'm going to be using the hourglass ambient lighting powder in the shade
11:05luminous light
11:06i'm using the morphe and 501 brush for this this is like my favorite
11:09highlighter brush of all time and i'm going to place this all over the cheeks
11:13the cheekbones for a little bit of a glow that i'm going to set my eyebrows
11:16with anastacio clear brow gel which is the best brow gel and the entire world i
11:20swear to god it's super glue in a tube for your browse
11:22now i'm going to pair this look with a nude lip
11:25I was going back and forth and I didn't want to do a pink or peach because these
11:28eyes just makes such a statement
11:30so I decided to go with anastacio liquid lipstick in the shade pure Hollywood
11:34which was a beautiful nude and what I love about it is it stays all day
11:37because it's a liquid lipstick and it doesn't require a lip liner so last but
11:41not least we're just going to now set our face i'm using Urban Decay to makeup
11:44setting spray just to lock all this and and we are done

0:58just remember that you can of course modify this look and create your own
1:02version of this cat I to fit your knees your eye shape and what you are
1:05comfortable with but i absolutely love this I love the technique is completely
1:10different than anything I've ever done before and you guys will see how easy it
1:13actually is it looks much more complicated and complex and like a
1:16picture that you're going to see that actually is so i hope that you guys
1:19enjoy enjoy making this tutorial for you i love you guys and if you want to see
1:23how to achieve this look then just keep watching my god
1:26hey guys so first thing I'm doing is moisturizing my lips I always do this
1:30before i start my makeups my lips it goes on more smoothly at the end and
1:34there's no what chapped lips get in the way that I'm going to throw my hair up
1:37in a high ponytail so I get all that hair out of my face so you guys can see
1:40what we're doing
1:41I'm going to prime my lids i'm using a mac pro longwear concealer and nw20 is
1:46my favorite all-time primer for the lids because it conceals and primes at the
1:49same time so it's perfection then i'm going to be going in with my new babies
1:54oh my gosh i love these eyeshadows so much these are the new anastacio Beverly
1:58Hills single eyeshadows they will be releasing next month and you guys will
2:02be the first to know because i will let you know the second they release
2:06they are beautiful I'm going to be going in with the shade birkin this is just a
2:11really nice
2:12neutral tone it's great for that crease area as a transition color is very
2:16similar to like a mac soft brown type shade if you're familiar with that i am
2:20using a Sigma e-40 blending brush to dust this all over the entire crease
2:24area you can put this all over the lid if you want you don't really have to
2:27we're really just focusing on that crease area i'm just buffing it out nice
2:31and gently with no harsh lines that i'm going to be going in with a gel eyeliner
2:35this is the key to this look I'm using Maybelline eye studio it from the
2:38drugstore it's black as can be and it's awesomesauce
2:41so what I'm going to do is create an outer wing i am using a e65 by Sigma I
2:48don't know what brush that was for a minute
2:50i'm going to create kind of like a bat type wing where I literally just carve
2:54out that V and then sharpen it up once I've done that I'm going to go in with
2:57the shade smoke
2:58this is again going to be a new shade by anastacio beverly hills and then using a
3:03more fee and three two one brush which is literally the most perfect brush for
3:06this technique I'm going to take that brown color and literally as your scene
3:10just smudge it and some oak it out it is so simple
3:14I'm going to go back with that same black liner and just darken it up a bit
3:18and you will have this look right here
3:20it's so simple but it looks more so much more complex than it is now i'm going to
3:24do is just go in and do a normal liner right on that lash line just like you
3:28would any other day just to kind of connect that wing to the inner corner
3:32now i'm going to do to create that inner corner cat eye is follow the natural
3:36tier duct of my eye
3:38some people's inner corners are going to go a little bit more down than others
3:40some are going to go more straight out
3:42i typically find if you want to look the best for your eye shape when your eyes
3:45are open and close
3:46just follow that natural tear duct so now i'm obviously just going to do the
3:50exact same thing to the other eye again I just draw out that V with an angled
3:55brush and I just fill it in as you'll see right here you might feel like wait
3:59what do I do with the eyeliner because you actually want to connect it to
4:02something don't just literally a buff into the i leave it alone
4:06go back with a super dark brown matte shade and just buff it out
4:10you don't really want about that . color up into the crease you more want to buff
4:13it towards the inner corner of the eye to really give you that long it elevated
4:16cat eye effect then again do your liner just like you usually would
4:20along that lash line and then make sure you take it all the way to the outer
4:23corner so that does connect with that wing again I'm going to do the inner
4:28corner of the same way that the other eye
4:30this might be easier for some of you just using a precise eyeliner brush it's
4:33not an angle brush I definitely think an angle brush can be a little bit harder
4:36but it's just what I'm used to
4:38I'm going to go in with the lower lashes in the style lash in the city but I
4:42always cold my lashes with a thin coat of mascara first before going in
4:46I think it makes it blend a little bit better and also i never ever going with
4:49mascara after my false lashes are on because it can cut down the longevity in
4:53the life of your lashes and make them look a little bit more fake and I want
4:58my false lashes to look as pretty and fluffy as they possibly can so I don't
5:02go in with mascara afterwards I always do it first then i'm going to move on to
5:05foundation I'm using our glass of ale foundation
5:08it's a very pretty eliminating foundation i will say though that it has
5:11a high SPF in it so it does smell like SPF just a warning i'm going to be going
5:15in with a morphe brush this is the end for 39
5:19i believe for foundation absolutely obsessed I've used only twice and i'm
5:22already claiming i'm obsessed you know what's love when I've only used it twice
5:25i'm using the word obsessed
5:28moving on I'm doing my eyebrows and I just showed you the first one super
5:31quickly because it was really out of focus the entire time i'm going to show
5:33you this one a little bit more slowly
5:36i am using the anastacio browse in the shade
5:39oh no i forgot the shade soft brown taupe
5:42I don't know i'll link it down below for you guys but I am going to go ahead and
5:46fill in my brows like normal with you guys want an updated brow routine
5:49just let me know in the comments section down below I'm going to conceal my under
5:53eye area and i am using NARS radiant creamy concealer to do this
5:57I know a lot of you've been saying recently that i have exchanged this one
6:00for the mac pro longwear and it's true you guys I just been using this recently
6:04i go through phases and this is just it's my boy right now so it's what we're
6:08doing I've been enjoying it and if you guys are wondering i do my concealer and
6:13foundation after my eyes when i'm doing a smoky or a cat eye look
6:17because sometimes you can mess up your foundation if you do your eyes
6:20second so doing your eyes first will ensure that you have the perfect
6:24foundation application and eyes as always i'm going to set my under eye
6:29area i am using
6:30mac pro longwear emphasize powder mixed with an associate of Beverly Hills
6:35banana powder this is from her contour kit and it also has put a little bit of
6:39that on my chin and my forehead just to even that out cuz sometimes a highlight
6:43underneath the eyes by itself can be a little overwhelming when you don't
6:45balance it around the face
6:47I'm going to go in with that same smoke color from anastacio if you guys can
6:51tell this is like the easiest thing ever right it's only two eyeshadows that is
6:55creating this look like
6:56yes please I'm going to go back in with that original shape that we went in
6:59Birken and i'm going to just buff that out with a pencil brush on this entire
7:03lower lash line
7:04if you guys don't have to be super smoky you can leave this part out and just do
7:08mascara and call it a day
7:10I wanted to blow it out I wanted to show you guys the full production the full
7:13effect and all the drama and potential this look really has
7:16so I'm going to call my lower lashes with Rima lash accelerator this is from
7:19the drugstore and it's one of my favorite lower lash mascara because it
7:23really separates your lashes and I don't like coffee bottom lashes
7:26I'm going to go in with mac cosmetics mylar I wanted to keep this look very
7:31mad I didn't want a lot of shimmer and it because I just absolutely love a
7:34smoky Matt I like who doesn't it's classic and it's timeless and my lawyer
7:38is a beautiful highlight that isn't a full map but it's not a shimmer house
7:41like this beautiful gleam to it then I'm going to go in and just do a little
7:45bronzing and contouring i am using a nars bronzer in the shade algorithm
7:50this is part of their holiday collection and i am using a morphe brush this is
7:55the 200m be 5 NB five and i'm going to bronze my face I'm going around my
8:01cheekbones around the temples in the forehead
8:04I absolutely love this brush i have been singing its praises for the past like
8:07three tutorials straight
8:09but seriously bomb.com I'm going to go back in with a makeup geek precision
8:12brush and just create a little line right there underneath the cheekbones
8:16just to accentuate this contour a little bit more so I really like a structured
8:21contour with a cat i think it's very flattering
8:24I'm going to go and with mac mineralize blush in the shade dainty which is just
8:28a really pale flattering girly pink so pretty i'm going to lightly dust that on
8:32the cheeks nothing too intense but we just want to have a little bit of a
8:35flush
8:36this looks painful honestly this shot makes me cringe
8:39anyways I'm going to be applying and I call on that lower water
8:43line in the struggle is real as always as you can see and then i'm going to
8:47finish this off with my new lipstick
8:50this is called buttercup you guys are the first to see in the first to know I
8:55am so excited to be using this and introducing it to you

0:36different and just up in the box
0:38it's ok i hear my eye so anyway this is not the only way to wear a shadow of
0:42course like i did it very dramatic you can wear a really colorful shot like
0:46this in many different ways you can use it as a pop of color on that lower lash
0:49line
0:50you can put it gently in the outer corner of your eye can kind of look it
0:53up from your eyeliner for a little purple pop over you can wet your brush
0:56and then go in and do liner with it that is really really fun but you don't need
1:01to they're all or nothing
1:02I really wanted to see the shadow and its full capacity so i did a very
1:05dramatic blown out purple smokey eye which I love creating for you so yeah I
1:10really hope that you guys enjoyed this tutorial i enjoyed making it for you so
1:14thank you so much for watching and I'll see you soon
1:16but hey guys i am so ready to do this
1:20so the first thing I'm going to do is take smaller i call this is by Mac
1:24smaller is a jet-black putting a black color all over the lid is going to make
1:28any eye shadow you choose to put on later pop like crazy which you'll see in
1:32just a few minutes but right now i'm going to just sloppily put this all over
1:36my lid area
1:37cute so cute and I'm going to buff it out with an e 32 from sigma buffing out
1:44on I coal is actually a lot easier than you would imagine it to be because it is
1:47such a crummy pencil as you can see it really has a nice gradient to as your
1:51buffing out the only thing you want to make sure to do is not exceed your
1:55crease area as you can see as I'm buffing it out i'm not going anywhere
1:59past the crease in my eyelid
2:01so again i'm going to put that all over the lid and I wanted to be the blackest
2:05of the black right next to the lash line and then of course your buffing out and
2:09just kind of fading it once you get up towards that crease
2:11now i'm going to be going in with a new makeup forever artists eye shadow and if
2:15you can't tell i'm very excited about this color is in the shade em - 928
2:19don't worry i'll link it down below for you and taking a sigma e25 brush I'm
2:23going to buff that in that entire crease area
2:26so this is just the next step we want to go from black to this plummy purple you
2:30guys can we just talk about how beautiful those colors right now
2:32seriously I cannot deal with it
2:34so as you can see i'm bluffing is all the way to the inner corner to the outer
2:38corner we wanted to be just as dark and intense from inner to outer then next I
2:43am going to go in with the shade orchid
2:45this is by ardency Inn and i'm using the exact same brush and I'm going to just
2:49go over top of that make up for ever eyeshadow and it's okay if it kind of
2:52falls down on top of what we've already done because we're going to go in and
2:55cover a lot of this up anyways doing all these steps is just going to give your
2:58smoky eye a lot of dimension and a lot of pop
3:01so when you're moving your face and you're moving your eyes people are going
3:04to see all different colors shining through
3:05now we are going to go in with the star of the show and this is in the shade
3:09royal oh wow she's so video to wall
3:12i am using a mac 242 to pack this color on my entire lower lid area all the way
3:17from inner corner of the tear duct all the way to outer corner
3:20I'm going to push that all the way up in my crease and then once i get to that
3:24crease area i'm going to go back in with the same brush that I used to apply that
3:27make up for ever eyeshadow and just blend those two together so that
3:30everything is seamless will have a very gradient I from a very bright purple to
3:34a plummy to be pink if you know what I mean
3:37and so basically you guys laying down that smaller eyeliner in the first place
3:40is going to make this eyeshadow pop even more if you ever want to take a color to
3:44another level just put a black eyeliner on before and it will just give it a
3:48really intense extra pop this is a very payment to shadow no matter what but I
3:52just honestly wanted to have a lot of fun and just see what we could do with
3:55it
3:56so as you can see i am using an e 25 just buffing back and forth to make sure
3:59we have no harsh lines then i'm going to go in with a black eyeshadow i believe
4:04this one is Mac carbon and i am using a makeup geek small crease brush just to I
4:09think this is a makeup brush
4:10I'm not sure I like this brush down below I'm going to pack that black in
4:14the outer corner of my eye
4:16just for a little something extra i will say a lot of times people can get
4:19nervous using Purple's they don't look like they have a bruised eye and the
4:22trick to that is using black and not grey
4:25do not mix great with your purple because that's when you can start to
4:28look like you got hit in the face caught in a dark alleyway
4:31but like this using black it really just gives a little extra smokiness
4:35so then I'm going to go in with my favorite lashes of life at the moment
4:37and they are by the brand flutter laughs
4:39ashes and this style is in the shade in the shade in the style Camilla all my
4:45gosh just get ready
4:46look at those flash oh my god they're so gorgeous I honestly want to wear them
4:52every day but they're very dramatic so they definitely call for a dramatic look
4:56so I was going to clean up that entire under eye area because of course working
4:59with bright colors you're going to have some fallout that i'm going to go in and
5:02do my foundation i am using giorgio armani a luminous silk and for those of
5:06you who asked i am currently using 6.5 as my color i believe is that down below
5:13to everything is always below
5:15i'm using my Sigma f80 kabuki brush just to buff this into the skin if you can
5:19tell I really press when i'm using this brush because it makes the foundation
5:22last longer
5:23now i'm going to be filling in my brows and i'm going to be using an SEO brow
5:27powder to do so today just because I thought I'd change it up so i am using
5:30the shade
5:31blonde and soft brown to do that but that's not fun so let's move on
5:35I'm going to be highlighting my brow bone with mac nylon
5:38this is such a beautiful brow highlighter it is very intense so make
5:41sure that you are light-handed when using it
5:43i'm going to be using a sigma f 72 highlight even though it's a concealer
5:47brush
5:47it's my favorite to highlight the brow bone and as you'll see i will bring this
5:50highlight down a little bit and turn my brush sideways and blend it in with that
5:55shadow in the upper crease doing this really helps complete the blending
5:58process to make sure that you have no jagged edges are harsh lines in that
6:02shadow area and it's beautifully buffed out it's a great secret makeup artistry
6:06and it makes such a difference then i'm going to just of course conceal
6:10hello this is necessary i'm going to be using my NARS radiant creamy concealer
6:14and then i'm going to be buffing out with a damp Beauty Blender
6:18I always make sure to tell everybody and make sure your beauty blender is damp
6:22that is what it is made for get it wet underneath the sink squeeze squeeze
6:25squeeze
6:25and then use it to apply foundation or concealer it just moisturize and hydrate
6:29the skin and it makes it so that nothing ever gets cakey and it's just fast and
6:32easy and it just looks beautiful
6:34so then i'm going to set that under eye area as always with anastacio banana
6:38powder this is an absolute must for me but you do you
6:42i'm going to use a flat definer brush and just pack on that same royal
6:45eyeshadow tightly against that lower lash line all the way from outer corner
6:49-
6:50the corner i'm going to make sure to take this all the way into that tear
6:52duct because I really want this to be dramatic and dramatic and bring it all
6:56the way really make the shadow more dramatic going back with that exact same
7:01m2m 928 eyeshadow for make up for ever and a pencil brush I'm going to buff
7:06this back and forth all over that lower lash line area putting two colors like
7:11this on that lower lash line will just make your eyes pop even more and get
7:14more dimension then using an e 25 from sigma i'm really going to buff this down
7:19I do not have any product on it but as you can see i'm going to just go back
7:22and forth over all of this under eye area and i will circle around on the
7:26edge of my eye to really make this look blown out cuz i want this to be more of
7:30a rounded I and a cat eye
7:32so that's why I'm going around the edges but i'm going to just pop that same
7:35nylon eyeshadow on the inner corner with a tiny little definer brush from Mac
7:38just for another little pop I love highlighting the inner corner and the
7:42brow because it really just evens out the I then i'm going to just mascara my
7:46lower lashes with remote lash accelerator and now i'm going to be
7:49bronzing i am using a Make Up For Ever bronzer and number 20
7:53i'm using a nars a brush to sculpt out my face
7:57I will say number 20 and Make Up For Ever bronzer doesn't look dark when
8:00you're looking at it in the pan when you apply it to the face it's absolutely
8:04beautiful so even if you feel like you're kind of tan number 20 is really
8:07beautiful on tons of people
8:09so once i have done that I'm going to go in with becca flower child blush and i'm
8:13going to be using a mac 129 short handle brush to apply this all over the apples
8:18of my cheeks and then make sure you really blend into that contour so that
8:21everything is nice and buffed out of course they're going to go in with becca
8:25rose gold this is my favorite cheap product at the moment right now using a
8:29sigma taper highlighting brush I'm going to run that all over that blush area
8:33just to really make those cheeks pop and glow that i'm going to go in with a bite
8:37Beauty lip liner in the shade and nutmeg
8:40it's a really beautiful neutral pink color and i am using this to line the
8:43entire lip area and i will also fill in the lip area and then once i have the
8:47entire lips coated with nutmeg i'm going to go over it with my lip gloss i
8:52created with Gerard cosmetics in the shade buttercream which is amazing if I
8:56do say so myself
8:57and then once you have completed that you are completely finished with this
9:01look
9:02so hope that you guys enjoy this video thank you so much for watching
9:05I love you and I'll see you soon bye guys
0:16hey guys today I'm going to be doing in this makeup look at every single intro
0:23is always be a game and I'm gonna be going to make the turn on the look that
0:28I want right here anyway
0:29today I'm going to finally be going to make up tutorial i mentioned that was
0:33super pumped to fill my makeup tutorial like a month ago and this was a look
0:37that was referring to
0:38I have been so excited to film this love because I have to be honest I think this
0:42is the fate of my favorite look at least my favorite smokey eye and I've ever
0:46done here on YouTube but i love this look and the my favorite thing about it
0:50is that it will look good on every buddy any skin color any i call this is a
0:54comment absolutely everyone like it's got warmth in there and we get like up
0:58George
0:59he likes it too what I love about this look is it has some more than there but
1:03we also have a really fun color but the color is such an awesome
1:07wearable color for a smoky eye you know what I'm saying like if you're going to
1:10do a color of the smoky eye I definitely this is wearable and it's just so fun
1:14and it's different so i hope that you guys enjoy it
1:17I did add a double winged liner to this look you do not have to do that you want
1:21to do any liner you can do winged liner you can do just a regular black line you
1:25don't do anything special like I wanted to do this because the night that I came
1:28up with this look later that night I was in bed and I came across old photos of
1:32myself and when i first started working at Mac and I used to do the double
1:35winged liner all the time and I would you like a stripe in between out like a
1:40white stripe or like a yellow stripe in between the double wing and i was
1:44looking at that I was like oh my gosh it's so cool like I haven't done that in
1:47years so i thought i would incorporate it into this look to make it more fun so
1:50I what you guys do this video is not friendly i know i'm talking so much but
1:54that's because i miss you haven't been here in a while
1:56the past week has been so busy and the next week is also in certain busy I so
2:01many family and friends business associates all coming into town and I've
2:05had four meetings in the past week and it's just been a lot
2:07so starting februari fit everything is going fine go back to normal calm down a
2:12little bit but this like two week gap is like the busiest two weeks of my year
2:16pretty much so i am trying to be active on Twitter and Instagram though and they
2:20kind of keep talking to you guys so that you don't feel like I'm gone for too
2:23long so yeah I love you guys thank you so much for watching this video and i'll
2:27talk to you guys soon bye
2:28all right let's do this the first thing i'm going to do today is go in with
2:32makeup geek creme brulee and Peach Smoothie eyeshadow
2:35I'm going to mix those two together and then apply them in my upper crease area
2:38going all the way back and forth from my inner corner to my outer corner working
2:42in circular windshield wiper motions
2:45it is super important to lay down a light base as a transition color in that
2:48upper crease because it'll make everything else that you put on later
2:52blend seamlessly with no harsh lines
2:54i'm going in with an e 25 which is just a little bit of a denser brush just to
2:58make that color a little bit darker in the upper crease area then i'm going to
3:01go in with makeup geek cocoa bear this is one of my favorite shadows of all
3:05time and i realized i have not used it and quite a while and my videos so it's
3:09about that time again i'm going to take a knee 25 again and put that in the
3:12entire upper crease
3:14now i'm going to go in with a dark brown shade i honestly would not recommend
3:18this particular one this is ground brown from mac i would use whatever dark brown
3:22shade you have for yourself at home because it's almost kind of choppy and
3:25difficult to blend so I just want to go with this one if you got something else
3:29using a pencil brush from makeup geek which i absolutely love this brush I'm
3:34going to pack that on the inner corner of my eye right by mighty ducks and i'm
3:37also going to pack it on the outer corner of my eye as well
3:41leaving a blank space right in between kind of like a sandwich if you get this
3:45all over your lid don't worry because we're going to go in and cover a lot of
3:47it up anyways I always make sure to go back after every single step though and
3:51just blend everything out cuz that's really key - no harsh lines is
3:54continuously going back and blending
3:56now i'm going to go in with the star of the show and this is makeup geek oiled
3:59eyeshadow in the shade
4:01Houdini look at the beauty just take a moment oh my gosh
4:05the shadows are so gorgeous and i am using a mac 242 brush to apply this
4:09this is a flat synthetic brush which is just like my favorite brush ever to
4:13apply anything that's creamy or super shimmery or glittery because it really
4:16holds the product very beautifully and lays on the eyes beautifully as well so
4:21i'm going to put this all over the entire
4:23hi your lid for inner corner to outer corner and once i'm in that crease and I
4:27it's time to blend it into that cocoa bear that warm reddish-brown i'm going
4:31to go back with another blending brush and just go back and forth
4:34take your time do this for a few seconds I'm going windshield wiper motions and
4:37really make sure that those to kind of meet together beautifully and seamlessly
4:41so you don't have harsh lines because I completely covered up that dark brown
4:45was going to go back really quickly and pack a little bit more on the inner
4:48corner and the outer corner
4:50you could do this with a black as well to make it even more intense but i
4:53wanted to do brown because i just kind of like that brownish bluish kind of
4:57warm reddish-brown all together i think they're very complimentary and they just
5:01tied together beautifully
5:02and then once again i will go back in with the same blending brush and just
5:06make sure that all of that is blended out because I always blend every single
5:09step out then I'm going to take a q-tip and a little bit of eye cream or any
5:14moisturizer eye makeup remover whatever you have and I'm just going to gently
5:17kind of a wipe away the excess because sometimes you can get a little sloppy
5:20and this is a nice little trick to kind of sharpen up that outer corner make it
5:24look nice and energy so that it's not sloppy or you don't have fallout all
5:27over the place
5:28then I'm going to go in and do my eyeliner I'm using Maybelline gel liner
5:32in the shade of black is black as always an angled brush
5:36today I'm only going to do a little bit of liner on the outer corner i'm not
5:39gonna bring this liner all the way and across the lash line because i don't
5:43want to cover up this gorgeous shadow that I have going on
5:46so because of that i'm just going to do a half way and just kind of flick it on
5:49the very edge and then we'll be done with that I'm going to go in with a mac
5:52pro eyeshadow and this is in the shade
5:54Kelly I just wanted to add a little extra pop as you can see it's really not
5:58that big of a difference and not really that necessary but you know I'm having
6:01fun and doing my thing and so I wanted to add a little bit of this in the
6:04center just for giggles
6:06this is a mac pro item so you can purchase it online or mac pro stores
6:10it's not available at you know like regular counters or regular stores now i
6:14am applying the lower lashes in the style lash in the sea
6:18these have a little wing like a flick on the end of the false lashes which really
6:22compliments the winged liner look that we have as you can see right here the
6:25difference between both eyes but I did feel like the wing on the end it kind of
6:30slightly cover up my double winged liner so that's just a tip for you
6:34i am going to be priming my face with Smashbox photo finish
6:36primer water and oh my gosh you guys can we say obsession this is like my new
6:41baby so I'm going to douse myself in this primer water let it get a little
6:45dry
6:46of course dry off the lashes we don't need those things to be sitting there
6:48when the face and then i'm going to go in with my foundation I'm using make up
6:51for ever HD foundation and i am a number one two three
6:55as you can see my neck is number one two three and my face is like a negative
6:58zero so i am going to be matching my neck as always i'm using a sigma flattop
7:03f80 kabuki brush and i do miss it with a little bit of fixed plus from Mac just
7:07because I like how she was at my foundation a little bit and it has
7:10glitter in it so it helps just to kind of make everything stay together like
7:13glue for me
7:15some people can have reactions to fix plus so if you're super-sensitive so
7:18just be on the lookout for that
7:20so I'm just going to blend this all over the face as always nothing too special
7:24and I know that sometimes I can look a little yellow and this is going on but
7:27listen I'm matching my neck and that is what's important it will all tie
7:31together in the end I promise I'm going to of course conceal as always i'm using
7:36a mac pro longwear concealer my favorite concealer of life and a damp beauty
7:40blender which is my favorite way to blend out my concealer ever so i take
7:43this down the side of my nose and I go up towards my temple and it's very big
7:47upside down triangle motion and I blend all that out and then i dab some on the
7:51center of my nose
7:52the center of my forehead I always put a little bit on my chin and my upper lip
7:56on my Cupid's bow as well just to even out that highlight so that we do not
7:59have stock white under eyes and everything else is tad we want
8:02everything to be nice and even
8:04now i'm going to be going in and doing a contour and i am using the Chanel soleil
8:09de tan ok wow we're just moving on i'm using this cream bronzer from chanel and
8:13i am using an FTE again from sigma to do this
8:17I do prefer the f-86 which is angled but that was dirty so we're working with
8:21what we got right now so I'm going to put this all over the cheekbones and
8:24also the temples and the top of the forehead right by my hairline and then
8:29we're going to go in and sculpt this out a little bit
8:31I do intend on doing a full cream contour and highlight video very soon
8:37it's been very highly requested so i'm going to skip through this pretty
8:40quickly for you guys are not going to too much detail but i am using the
8:43Smashbox contour sticks to do this process that i am working with her right
8:47now and i'm using a damp beauty blender to blend
8:50everything out now a harsh harsh contour like this on day to day basis might not
8:54be so ideal and might not be ideal for any of you but I like a really intense
8:59striking contour when you're working with smoky eyes in a very dramatic look
9:02so I of course as always i'm going to set my under eye concealer and then i'm
9:06going to move on to my under eye area so i am using an angled brush this one is
9:11by morphy and i'm going back with the original color from makeup geek in the
9:14shade creme brulee and i'm going to just lightly kind of carve out that lower
9:19double wing that we're going to be doing
9:21I do want my double wing to be kind of smoky so that's why I'm starting off
9:24with a shadow and not just immediately going in with a black intense liner but
9:28i will go in and continue to make it a little bit more intense with liner but
9:33as you can see i'm going to do is go from that lower lash line and just run
9:36it parallel to that winged liner that we already have on the top lid this when
9:41you look at it looks like wow that's too complicated that's too much for me but
9:44if you really try on your own I you'll probably be very quickly surprised how
9:48easy this actually is to do on yourself
9:51so going back with a little teeny blending brush i'm just going to blend
9:54all that out because i do want it to be a little bit smokier than normal
9:58then with a little bit of concealer and a finer brush I'm going to put that in
10:01between those two wings so that it kind of stands out and it's a little bit more
10:05defined
10:06can we talk about how crazy is I didn't bring that blew down on my lower lash
10:09line
10:10I always bring the color down my lower lash line and today I did it and it's
10:13like what
10:14who am i but i really really like this i think that it just makes it look a
10:18little bit different than something that I would normally wear
10:20so I am is going back with that black gel liner and making it more intense i
10:24did just fill in my brows by the way I felt like it was unnecessary to put that
10:27on camera since i recently did an update a brow tutorial I am going to highlight
10:31my inner corner of my eye I'm using Mac nylon which is a very intense highlight
10:37I absolutely love it i use it for brow highlight cheek bone highlight any
10:40height you need
10:41nylon is a very intense shimmery yellow based highlight and very beautiful on
10:46tons of different skin tones so now i'm going to go in and I'm going to line my
10:50lower waterline i am using ardency Inn eyeliner and the black is color they
10:54have it is the creamiest of all time and then i'm going to go in and cut my lower
10:59lashes with mac google black mascara
11:02now i'm going to be highlighting my cheekbones and i am using the hourglass
11:05ambient lighting palette the center shade i'm not sure what it's called
11:08right now but look at how gorgeous this is it's like heavenly it's so beautiful
11:13i am using a sigma tapered highlighting brush to do this and then over top of
11:17that i'm going to lay down makeup geek spellbound blush which is a really
11:21beautiful kind of muted rosy pink and I just think that it looks absolutely
11:25gorgeous over top of this highlight it's like it's beaming through the blush
11:29I love it now to finish everything off i'm going to be going in with this new
11:32kat von d contour and highlight kit and honestly you guys i am just using an
11:36excuse to use this because i am so in love with this kit i am using the brush
11:41that you can buy along with it just to kind of set all the contour that I did
11:45earlier and sculpt out the John the chin and just make everything a little bit
11:49more precise and cut then i'm going to go in and finish off this look by doing
11:52my lips and i am starting off with the Urban Decay liner in the shade native
11:56I'm not overdrawn my lips or anything like that i'm just using it as a base
12:00and then i'm going to go in with lime crime coquettes which is one of my
12:04favorite lipsticks ever it's a nice kind of peachy pink kind of nude shade
12:09I love lime crime lipsticks because they last such a long time on my lips
12:11personally and then to finish everything off i'm going to go in with my favorite
12:15makeup setting spray and this is urban decay chill makeup setting spray you use
12:19whatever you want you do you boo
12:21that completes this look I hope that you guys enjoyed thank you so much for
12:24watching i love you guys and I'll see you soon
0:18hey guys so for today's video I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this
0:24look at just the right here
0:25all of my place I am really really excited to be doing this look because i
0:30have been wanting to do this look for about five weeks now and i was debating
0:33if I should do it or not
0:35sounds like I just say screw into a spring tutorials like I gotta do it
0:39I've been thinking about this look for way too long to not do it I five weeks
0:43I've been what I've been planning this look out honestly I talk to you guys
0:45about on snapchat
0:47I had to get this out of my system guys before jumping into a spring tutorials
0:51i'm very excited for spring and summer trends not excited for spring and summer
0:55because here in florida i get so humid enjoy brace yourselves
0:58but spring and summer makeup trends mmm very excited about
1:03I can't flippin wait flippin know why I that such a funny term
1:07oh yeah so for today's video I'm doing a brown and glittery smokey eye and let me
1:12just tell you it has been a journey
1:14finding a beautiful dark brown glitter
1:17I have been online for about four weeks ordering glitter from all different
1:21companies and even company the cell like over a hundred different litters
1:25it's so hard to find like a beautiful true dark brown leather so for today's
1:31video i use the pretty star groundwater that I could personally find on my hunt
1:35for today's tutorial I carried my silky I with a really intense dark brown lip
1:40and i'll be honest when the dark brown lip first came to the scene and people
1:44were wearing it I was like no thank you all passed that looks like doodoo all up
1:47on your lips
1:48not for me within about three weeks I was like
1:51do I absolutely love a dark brown lip now but it is not for everybody so for
1:57those of you who want to recreate this look
1:59don't think that you need to put a bullet you can do a nude and neutral lip
2:02and you will totally be good to go
2:05i'm going to call it the circle because it drives me crazy it's a very long
2:08story but people have asked questions about it and an electrician came here
2:12and made this mark on my wall
2:14he didn't have a pen with him and he's like well I don't have a pen as it will
2:17all I have eyeliner and he was a battle work
2:19so with my eyeliner he was like oh like a move that's what that is but this is
2:25changing very soon so it'll be gone for those of you who are like like I get it
2:29I'm like I'm like that - I'm nosy one of those girls let's just
2:33I get it I'm going to stop babbling now I swear to God I see that in the
2:36beginning of every single video don't I
2:37but anyways keep in mind that even though that this is a really dark smoky
2:41look this can still do more in the spring there are no rules there's trends
2:45of course but if you want to rock this and like at on a date night and the
2:48spring and girl do you all wear these colors all spring along like of course
2:52so that's the beauty of makeup people set trends but you're a person too so
2:56you can set a trend and I'm saying transferred to my people
2:59where people look for around friends I'm gonna be wearing this in the spring and
3:02summer
3:03you do what you want to do that's the beauty of makeup i love you guys so much
3:06for watching this video and i will see you guys in my next video bye guys
3:11hello my friends thank you for joining me here today
3:14first thing to do is pick up my morphe 35o palette and I'm going to grab this
3:18really light orange II kind of pale peachy shade us one of my favorites and
3:24using the morphe m4 for one brush I'm going to put this in my crease
3:29today I'm going to try to keep the colors a little bit lower on my eye
3:31because it's going to be really bold and intense so I don't want to go overboard
3:34and go up too high to the brow that i'm going to grab the shade which is a
3:38little bit more neutral but in the same tone as the first day that we went in
3:42with I'm going to pack that literally right on top
3:45the reason i will go in with two or three shades on top of each other is
3:49because it makes your job easier when blending out shades when you only blend
3:53out one color can make its kind of difficult you can sit there for a while
3:55can be kind of choppy when you go in with multiple shades over top of each
3:59other just a little bit at a time
4:01it blends out easier and it gives more dimension to the eye
4:03now i'm going to go in with this darker brown shade this is one of my favorite
4:07colors in the palette because it's such a beautiful brown it's not cool
4:11whatsoever but it's not to neutral and it's not too warm and it's the perfect
4:14shade of brown it's not too dark
4:17I absolutely love it so with that color I'm going to do the exact same thing as
4:20before and I'm going to pack that right on in the crease keeping it nice and low
4:24as you can see all the way to the inner corner but i'm not going to go up
4:27whatsoever on the bridge of the nose i'm going to keep it nice and flat on the
4:31inner corner
4:31I don't want this to be blown out to dramatic today since it's going to be
4:35such a dramatic intense dog
4:37I I don't look like i've been hit punched in the face is not a cute look
4:41so now i'm going to pick up a Natasha danone a palette and I'm going to use
4:44the shade
4:45aight aight viso 88 V and now i'm using the morphe em 433 rush
4:51this is my go-to blending brush if you guys need one blending i brush this is
4:55the one I would go with
4:56I can't live without this brush and as you can see this is a warm dark brown if
5:00you don't want to spend the money on Natasha danone shades i would suggest
5:03Mac swiss chocolate it's extremely similar to the shade
5:07you'll get the same result pretty much i'm going to pass that on the lid in the
5:10exact same area that I do with the other colors really making sure that its
5:13darkest in the crease of the eye and I'm going to go back and with my original
5:17blending brush with no product on it and just run over the edges to make sure
5:20that it's all blended out but as you can see i'm keeping it nice and light and
5:24I'm sorry not like nice and tight and low on the lid so it's not too dramatic
5:29and over the top
5:30now i'm going to pick up a kat von d and this is occur metal crush shadows I
5:34believe they're called in the shade energy and then i'm going to dampen my
5:38brush with mac fix+ and everyone always asks i put the product on my brush first
5:43and then I dampen it that's how I think I get the best results and now i'm using
5:47a mac 242 brush which is one of my absolute favorite go-to all over lid
5:52brushes i just think it's perfect
5:54it packs on pigments glitters metallics everything you can think of i just love
5:59this brush so much and I'm going to pack that on the entire lid from inner corner
6:04always outer corner kind of as a base for the glitter that we're going to go
6:07in with but first i'm going to go in with a gel liner and i'm going to be
6:11using color pop call me which is a dark brown kind
6:15of purple undertone and it's definitely a different color it's really pretty and
6:19i'm going to be doing just like a baby half wing today because I didn't want to
6:23leave the outer corner of my eye I totally blank but I didn't want to do
6:26something totally typical like always and do an intense thick black winged
6:30liner so I chose to do a dark brown and I thought that this dark brown was
6:34really pretty because it had some purple notes in it so it didn't just completely
6:38blend in with the rest of the look one hundred percent and i am doing like a
6:41baby half wing as opposed to doing a thick all over the lid wing
6:45I wanted to keep it just the outer corner and that way the glitter can kind
6:49of speak for itself and they're not both fighting for who's boss
6:52and then I'm gonna go in with obsessive compulsive cosmetics also known as OCC
6:56loose glitter in the shade coffee
6:58i'm going to be using it too faced shadow insurance glitter glue this
7:02glitter glue is hands down the best glitter glue if ever use I've tried so
7:05many from so many different cosmetic companies and this is my absolute
7:09favorite so you put the glitter glue all over your lid with the brush and then
7:13while it's still tacky
7:14you just go in and start packing on glitter and as you can see this is a
7:17loose glitter and I am barely getting any fallout whatsoever all my face
7:22if any like it really is the best glitter glue in the world I would never
7:27ever use anything else
7:29honestly especially if it's an occasion where you really don't want your glitter
7:32to be messy and you wanted to stay nice and perfect to face glitter glue is
7:36where its I'm telling you it is the bomb
7:39so using that same exact brush that I've used for everything else on the lid
7:43I'm just packing this glitter all over i want to make sure not to cover up my
7:46eyeliner on the outer corner and I want to grab some mac cosmetics reflex
7:51antique gold don't know why my face gets so splotchy
7:55I don't know I'm so sensitive you guys at my face is such a mess all the time
7:59and I'm just going to pack a little bit of that just in the center of the ideas
8:03for a little bit more dimension
8:05you really don't even notice that it's there it's just going to kind of make
8:08this one of your I pop a little bit more then I'm grabbing blinking butte lashes
8:12these are the style Samantha created Samantha's here on YouTube her name is
8:16Samantha with 3 s's and these lashes are beauti ful so I was pop some of those on
8:22and then i'm going to prime my face
8:25i am using the Becca back
8:27lighting filter or something this is the luminous fiber i'll link it down below
8:32I'm going to prime my entire face with that and i'm going to be going in with
8:35giorgio armani a luminous silk foundation one of my favorite
8:39foundations of all time and i am back to using a my morphe foundation brush brush
8:45this is the m4 39 brush
8:47I was on the artiste brush kick for a while which I still really love that
8:50brush but i have been back to this one the past couple of weeks i just love it
8:55it's one of those brushes that it's just it's always going to be there for you no
8:57matter what no matter what you go through no matter how bad times get that
9:01brush will always work I love it
9:03now i'm going to put on some urban decay naked skin concealer and I'm going to
9:08blend it out under my eye area i am using the new on kat von d & Beauty
9:12Blender collaboration which is why the Beauty Blender is black
9:16I think it's super cool even though you can see every little speck of concealer
9:20and Iran it's cool to see a black beauty blender and then I'm going to take that
9:24same concealer and put it down the center of my nose on my Cupid's bow and
9:27on my chin and i'm going to kind of just blend it out everywhere so that we have
9:32a nice highlighted center of the face as well because that under eye area was
9:35looking pretty white because my spray tan is very very orange you talk right
9:39now so I need to kind of even out the face then I'm going to grab Anasazi a
9:43banana powder and normally i mix this with some mac and the size but recently
9:48i have been loving just using this all by itself
9:51I feel like it makes my under eyes look better I feel like it kind of hides any
9:55creepy or dryness it really brightens it doesn't accentuate any like on like
10:00under eye lines or anything like that i love it
10:03now i'm going to be going in with giorgio armani powder
10:06I just discovered this like a week and a half ago and oh my god I why did I ever
10:13know about this powder before it is such a beautiful face powder so I'm going to
10:18lightly set my entire face with this powder that way i can go in with bronzer
10:22and everything will go on a nice and smooth
10:25I'm going to grab this color again that we use on the upper lid from the morphe
10:2935o palette using any pencil brush I'm going to begin to put this on the under
10:34eye area all the way from inner corner to outer corner but when I say in our
10:38corner
10:39I don't like to go too hard on
10:40inner tear duct because then it can start to look messy especially
10:43throughout the day so I don't bring it all the way and I kind of just go
10:47towards the inner corner and it kind of stopped right at that tier . if that
10:51makes sense
10:52these shots are terrible when i was adding this I was like I need to lower
10:55my camera
10:56this is such a mess and the facial expressions i make i just can't so right
11:00now i'm going with that same Natasha didn't own a shade and I'm just fucking
11:04that out and then I'm going to grab some black liner this is by ardency Inn I've
11:08said a million times this is the best black liner i've ever used on my
11:12waterline it doesn't move
11:14it's so creamy and easy to apply and then I'm going to grab a little bit of a
11:18black shadow on a definer brush and just stay right on that lash line and just
11:23wiggle back and forth so that it smokes out look at my mouth though
11:26honestly I'm like all up in your face pretty much out of focus of my mouth
11:30hanging open like could I really chocolate like get it together haven't
11:35you been doing this for like three years now four years come on
11:38reevaluate your life i am putting mascara on my lower lashes of course i'm
11:42using L'Oreal
11:44what is this l'oreal carbon black voluminous mascara that's what it is
11:48and then for brows i'm going to be using the Anastasia brow definer oh you guys
11:54are probably gonna get sick of me talking about this freaking product but
11:57honestly you guys
11:58it is so good like I don't even care it's getting to that point in our
12:02relationship
12:02I am loyal you'll be getting our invitations very soon the wedding is
12:06happening we are in a committed relationship
12:08so let's just move on I'm going to be bronze in my face using Mac give me son
12:12I just recently purchased this product again I was shopping on like mac
12:16cosmetics calm and I saw give me son and I'm like oh my gosh why have I not use
12:20this if you guys are watching my very first videos here on YouTube
12:23I went through probably five of these like this was my favorite bronzer of all
12:27time i've been using again this week and I'm like why did I ever stop using this
12:32bronzer it's so beautiful and i am using the mac 135 brush to apply it and then
12:37i'm going to do just a little bit of cooking and I'm going to use some are
12:40cma no color translucent powder i'm going to let this sit here for just like
12:44two minutes while I just run over my face with some other products so that
12:47it's not as sloppy as i just applied it
12:50i am putting some anastacio clear brow gel which is
12:53the gorilla glue a brow gel honestly it's the bomb and i'm taking a little
12:57bit more of a banana powder and just putting it on the center of my base my
13:01chin and just kind of running it over like the t-zone area cause I just felt
13:04like I wanted to be a little bit more defined that way the bronzer didn't like
13:08run over to the center of my face
13:10i'm going to go ahead and blend out that bacon if you will always the best
13:15feeling when you blend that out on your contour like in your bronzer just nice
13:18and sharp and clean like I swear I think that's my favorite part of doing makeup
13:21now for blush I'm going to go in with two Mac blushes this whole palette you
13:26see here is matte blushes
13:27I'm going to grab modern Mandarin such a tongue twister for me and copper tone
13:32and i'm going to mix those two together and then i'm going to put that on the
13:35apple of the cheeks going a backward towards the temple kind of blending in
13:39with the bronzer
13:41I didn't want to be too much on the apples of my cheeks though because then
13:43I can look I had a sunburn
13:44I'm trying to kind of angle it to the side and brush it back i'm going to use
13:48the charlotte tilbury bar of gold to highlight this is my first time using it
13:52and I think it's really really beautiful and for the brush I'm using the morphe
13:56am 310 fan brush i mentioned this in my favorites video i have been loving this
14:03recently to highlight with I just think that it makes it so easy and just
14:07distribute it evenly across your face I've really been loving it
14:10I'm gonna take a little bit that same highlight and put on my Cupid's bow and
14:14then it's time to go in with our lip
14:16i'm going to be using jeffree star dominatrix which is a very very deep
14:20dark brown
14:22it does have a red undertone in it which I really really like because there are a
14:26lot of different shades of dark brown out there
14:28this one definitely has a red undertone which I just think is really pretty and
14:32complement to look especially like this one
14:34not to mention jeffree star liquid lips are one of the best and my personal
14:38opinion
14:39I'm not a liquid lip fan overall but i do like Jeffrey
14:42so yeah after you apply that lip we are good to go so i hope you enjoy this

0:25collection i started pulling out my gold my glitters and I need to come up with
0:29this look at my mind and it was like gold foil glare on the lid and like a
0:32brown cut crease maybe with some purple smoke down underneath and an inner
0:36corner cat eye and I was like my creative juices were flowing at the mad

2:06guys like this video
2:08it is going to be a top through video today meaning i'm going to be talking to
2:11you and I'm applying my makeup as opposed to a makeup tutorial with a
2:15voice over so you guys at the style this video let me know and I will talk to
2:19incorporate more voice overs in the future so let's jump into it
2:23so we're going to be starting off with my skin today so I'm going to start by
2:26priming my face i'm going to be using the Makeup Forever skin equalizing
2:30smoothing primer so i'm going to be putting this where I have issues with
2:33pores because I don't all over my face and I really don't want this to matt
2:36face so only going to put it right on the nose in this cheek area because
2:40that's really where the poor issue 6 not for the rest of the face i'm going to be
2:43going in with the hourglass fail mineral primer this is oil free and I'm going to
2:48be applying this to the rest of the face where I did not apply on the smoothing
2:52primer right there in the center so I'm going to put this everywhere else and
2:57it's not necessary to use two primers obviously you can just use one but I'm
3:02happiness
3:03ok so now for foundation I'm going to be going in with the new
3:07L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion I'm so excited when I saw that lore'l was
3:11coming out with a new formula and the true max lumi meas True Match Lumi used
3:16to be like my my ride or die
3:19oh my god if you guys remember from back in the day I used that for a year
3:22straight i'm using the shade + 3.5 so the system is a little different because
3:26the original True Match Lumi I'm a w5 and this is n 3.5 so I don't know how it
3:32works exactly but it looks like this little cushion and then foundation comes
3:36out there also
3:37it's so cute I'm going to go in with a new brush my morphe I haven't tried
3:41yeah it's brand new and this is the e 50 for me to lead collection so it's a
3:46synthetic brush and literally just going to take a brush and put it straight in
3:50here
3:51hopefully I like this brush oh god I'm like okay wait to see the color my
3:55beloved I've gotten so pale the past couple of days because I've been
3:59exfoliating and all my tan is coming off and it says it's a buildable coverage
4:04but I honestly feel like this goes on
4:06initially as a medium to full coverage it's really easy to build it up see can
4:12you see how much is going on my face like it's full coverage i really have to
4:16like spread it around so that I don't get cake face and I were not found a
4:23shin i'm going to go in with concealer and I actually just got to New on Real
4:28Techniques Beauty sponges because my was getting so nasty and dingy and falling
4:32apart and i stopped me . amazonas they just got in the mail this morning so so
4:35happy so I just went and wet this one under the sink and it's so firm
4:40I was like oh that's what it's supposed to feel like I have totally forgotten
4:43um so I'm going to be going in with the new makeup forever concealer
4:47I don't know these are actually out yet they sent them to everyone on their PR
4:50lyst
4:51but there wasn't any note as far as the launch date or anything in the bag that
4:55came in so i'm using shade why 33
4:58so I'm just going to . it under my eye area like this if you're super creamy
5:04but it doesn't feel so thick that you're like oh this is not going to blend out
5:08like it feels really really creamy kind of slimy but very blendable it's super
5:14hydrating - it's not dry which is amazing
5:17so now it's going to take the damp Beauty Blender and i'm just going to
5:20blend this out
5:23I just bouncing up and down very quickly
5:26this is my favorite way to blend a concealer of all time is using any sort
5:31of damp sponge if you really dry on the under eye area a tip is to take some
5:36pics + from Mac like this and spread it on your damn
5:40under and then blend it out and that will make your concealer really really
5:45hydrating but because it has blisters and it will also help it stick to each
5:48other as well so if you suffer and struggle with super dry under eye area i
5:52would suggest using some mac fix+ on your beauty blender
5:56ok so now i'm going to set that and i'm going to kick it old school and have to
6:01kick it old school and I've been doing the same damn thing for the past year
6:04and a half but recently i've been using the laura mercier translucent powder and
6:08today I want to use the mac pro emphasize powder and the Anasazi of
6:12banana powder the nslc banana powder you can buy individually on her website and
6:17the mac pro and the size you can buy this on mac com or any post or I'm going
6:21to be using the morphe e 48th this is a new brush in your recollection
6:25I just got these yesterday and I haven't tried them yet so I'm just trying them
6:28now for the first time and then i'm going to just set that under my eye
6:35ok so not the face i'm going to spend it very lightly with a powder
6:38normally i would use the laura mercier well the laura mercier translucent
6:41powder but today I want to be as mad so I'm going to keep the old school using a
6:45demon mineralize skinfinish from Mac this is the shade medium is going to be
6:49using a big fluffy brush is the e34 morphy and i'm just going to get all up
6:55in there
6:56I'm just going to lightly set the face i'm not doing this for additional
6:59coverage mineralize skinfinish is very very light coverage so I'm just doing
7:03this simply just set the foundation in place so it doesn't run anywhere and
7:08this will make it really easy to blend products on the skin with bronzer and
7:11blush and highlight but this is not really going to get much coverage
7:15alright so now we're going to move on ties and I actually put a new lens on my
7:18camera today so look at what we can do
7:20all
7:21we can zoom in i normally film like a 50 millimeter lens so i can zoom into my
7:26eyes all the way and get closer but today gotten lensbaby so we're going to
7:31be able to finally zoom it
7:32ok so for the eyes I'm not gonna lie i'm challenging myself not to make a beat
7:37today because I always going to make a beat for this look especially i use the
7:41eyeshadow deserts and if you're a shot all time but today I'm going to branch
7:47out and use different brands so what
7:49let me see what i got here so I'm going to grab some shadows from the lorac Pro
7:53make it 2 palette i'm gonna start off with the shade right here called Tommy
7:57the third one in on the top row I'm going to take that and just dust it
8:01right there in the crease you guys know this process the transition color I'm
8:08going to not keep this precise really at all we're going to blend it out in this
8:12entire crease area and then once we don't have a type of product on the
8:16brush computer you put it there in the crease
8:18that's we're going to start working kind of upward just to make sure it's blended
8:21out in this entire brow bone area
8:24anything over here just going to go in and place that color initially right
8:27there in the pocket of my crease
8:29if you do not have a crease just create one
8:32just do this wherever you want to create a crease on your eye area if you have
8:36put it I just brings color up a little bit higher than your hood crease area if
8:41that makes sense
8:42it's a very important when you're blending your I try to not only going
8:45windshield wiper motions but also circular motion so I start off with
8:48windshield wiper and then I go in tiny little circular and I go back to
8:52windshield wiper and then I go circular that's really the key to getting an
8:56eyeshadow to blend is windshield wiper and circular a nice shadow color though
9:01like this ok so now i'm going to go in with my is not focusing
9:06now i'm going to go in with burlap right here which just had a little bit more of
9:10like a baby puke coloring do it with you know I all about that life
9:15i'm going to just layer that right on top of Tony the original quality when
9:21I'm with the exact same area is going to give it more dimension by layering the
9:25shades windshield wiper motions and then circular motions so it was kind of like
9:33put it on there like this kind of sloppy can see it really choppy and unblended
9:37and then we'll begin to do circular motions and windshield wiper
9:42just back and forth between those two motions
9:45we've got those two shadows on our eyes i'm going to grab the mac pro and
9:48besides shaping powder again that I used to set my under eye area in this time
9:52I'm going to put it on a eyeshadow brush my hair brush I'm going to grab this on
9:57a mac
9:58ok that's attractive I'm going to get this on a mac 242 brush just any flat
10:03synthetic eye shadow brush will work
10:05I'm going to get to pack this on the inner corner of the eye to make it nice
10:08and bright
10:09this powder is just so pigmented as you can see i love it so much for an
10:14eyeshadow i think it's so beautiful
10:16the great thing about it is that it's not frosty but it's not a full mass so
10:20it doesn't look chalky
10:22it hasn't a really beautiful natural sheen to it that's why it's so easy to
10:27apply and it looks so nice
10:30I'm just packing us on and just patting motions looking to make sure to bring
10:35this up in this area
10:37this will help open up the eyes more if you leave it just on the lid it kind of
10:41close the eyes
10:43but if you bring it up like this towards the bridge of the nose and towards the
10:47brow
10:47this will open your eye up i'm also going to take this and put it underneath
10:51the eye area and the inner tear duct area and make this nice and bright
10:58right here I'm doing this because we are going to go in
11:02and put some glitter liner in this area so I want this nice bright highlights
11:06too kind of shine through and make that glitter pop even more so that's why I'm
11:10pockets on the inner corner here because I now that we are very white eyed and
11:15right I'm going to just fill in my brows because it's a good time to do so
11:19I always start at the bottom of the ground to give it the shape that I want
11:22and I make sure to hold the pencil far down I never hold it up here otherwise
11:26it will make it really dark and intense i will it really lightly at the very
11:30bottom like a pencil and I just do light strokes to get the shape that I desire
11:37and then go from there
11:38I am constantly using the spoolie I cannot live without the spoolie I
11:45physically could not do my brows without this
11:47now i'm going to highlight my brow bone and i'm going to be using what do you
11:53know something better change i'm going to be using Mac nylon and i'm just going
11:57to strictly put it right at the tippy top part of the ground ball just like a
12:03little a little battle yeah i'm not going to drag it around and like blend
12:08it out otherwise it's just going to become too much too over-the-top to
12:12quickly so just right there at the high point
12:14so now i'm going to go in with my favorite Brown shadow right now and this
12:18is by anastacio is in the shade
12:20fudge I'm going to grab budge on a sigma e 15 which is just a flat definer brush
12:24I'm going to begin to press it really tightly into my lower lash line only
12:30strictly on the outer corner of the eye
12:33so we're just going to keep that like a super harsh line okay it doesn't look
12:40good right now but it will it's a process
12:42do not try to blend with a small precision brush like this one
12:47just pack it on there and make it harshly get sharp it's not going to look
12:49good but we will blend it out with a pencil brush I'm going to go back
12:54the same eyeshadow that I used on my upper lid i will grab you could grab
12:58Tony or burlap or any sort of warm round to use on your lid it does not matter
13:02either one of these will work
13:03I'm going to grab the burlap and just on the very tip of the brush
13:07this is the morphe e18 pencil brush and then i'm going to just put it directly
13:12over that fudge eyeshadow and just blend it in tiny little motions back and forth
13:19I'm kind of wiggling my brush downward so I'm kind of going like this and I'm
13:23going down like this because i personally love the look of a smoky
13:28lower lash line and the outer corner and when it's kind of brought down it really
13:32helps open up the eyes if your upper shadow was brought up your lower shot at
13:36shadows brought down on the outer corner
13:38it widens the eye and gives you a doe-eyed effect so that's what we're
13:42doing right now is we're opening the eye by dragging us down and out
13:47I need to do the no mirror makeup challenge I want her how bad I would
13:51suck at that because I don't look in the mirror a lot when I'm blending my lower
13:55lash line and i always think like I wonder how that I would do with that
13:58challenge i'm going to use the map , graphic pencil in the shade and see 15 /
14:04and w20 any cream eyeliner pencil will work
14:08I just don't want brown shadow in this water line
14:12I want it to be nice in wide-eyed
14:15ok next step is going to be applying lashes this is totally your call though
14:20you do not need to apply lashes for this look you could just do mascara and
14:24totally get away with it
14:25i'm going to apply lashes though because it's just going to add that extra
14:28glamour and it's very easy to apply lashes once you practice and get the
14:32hang of it you'll be able to pop them on like boom this is the Loreal voluminous
14:34carbon black such a good drugstore mascara so for lashes i'm going to be
14:39going in with on this legal actions by flutter these were limited editions
14:43they're no longer available what makes me so sad because they're like the most
14:47comfortable beautiful lashes everyone in my life they're extremely long though so
14:51I know that not everyone is going to like the drama
14:53these lashes on them personally like I do I'm just comfortable with myself and
14:57very dramatic lashes but I know that these are very over the top for a lot of
15:01people on it is important to find your lash and what works for you
15:06i always recommend the floor lashes whisper sweet nothings they are long
15:11so if you have small eyes or really hooded eyes you might not love them but
15:15they're so fluffy and girly and beautiful also the are dealt with speed
15:20and the drugstore those are great
15:22Vegas nay I know that she has some lashes that are so not at walgreens and
15:25alton and i have not tried them yet but I just order them online but I've heard
15:29great things about those and those are an expensive as well so there's so many
15:33great lash brands out there now it's just important to find like what style
15:37works best on you because we all have different styles so when I sit here and
15:40say oh my god I love this boss so much
15:42there's gonna be thousands thousands of people are going to hate it because it's
15:45not gonna look the same on my eyes that will on your we all have different
15:47shapes so please flutter please sheyla bring it back here so good
15:52I'm gonna pop these super duper close to the lash line and that's why my tweezers
15:59come in handy there are tools out there made for this aren't losers because
16:03these could definitely poke your eye out so I do not suggest going in with razor
16:06sharp tweezers on go in with an actual professional last tool but that's what
16:11they're so great for as you can get them so close to your actual lash line and
16:16not have any gaps or spaces
16:18I could never apply a lash without some sort of tweezer or tool like this is my
16:29secret to getting it so close to the lash line
16:32pop them what on I always start on the outer corner to make sure that that here
16:37is first and then I go in
16:39with the inner corner because the inner corner can always be a little bit testy
16:43here so i do the outer corner first just to make sure that we're all going to go
16:48alright so now we're going to move on and we're going to go in with some
16:50glitter liner
16:51we are going to be using the Urban Decay heavy metal glitter like glitter liner
16:55this is my absolute favorites glitter liner of all time
16:59so all I'm gonna do is line directly over where we put that white on the
17:03under eye area so i'm going to start on the inner corner and i'm going to get
17:06really so make sure that you don't do your mask area you need to do this with
17:10no mascara on the lower lashes and i'm going to get super duper tight to the
17:15waterline and just begin to stroke glitter on that area
17:20if you have mascara on at this point you're going to completely ruin it and
17:22get glitter all over your mascara so make sure you do this first
17:28I just start on the very inner porter and then I just drag you do not put on
17:39your waterline you don't want to put any inner rim you just want to put it on the
17:43skin right voice right underneath of the water line on the lash line
17:51ok so once you know that you are totally done applying glitter and that's when
17:54you can apply mascara to your lower lash line but i would not apply mascara until
17:59you know for a fact that you're done with your glitter otherwise you can just
18:02get messy and not have that clean look that we're going for
18:05i'm going to be using the volume mascara about having a quantum my mom squares is
18:08mascara so like let's give it a try and see what she's hiding up about
18:18trying so hard not to make my ugly face because whatever i apply mascara on like
18:21where is my sculpting powder ok so i'm going to be using Mac shade start today
18:29shade sir is actually permanent item at the mac pro store so you can get it on
18:33mac.com i believe and at any pro store
18:35it comes in a little individual pan like this its magnetic map shade started my
18:40favorite contour like all time I think it is such a good shade kind of want to
18:45try this brush for contouring I'm really scared of it I haven't used this before
18:49I kind of think that this could be cool
18:52this is the morphe e 58 brush so I'm going to try this for the first time for
18:56a contouring powder so since i haven't used it yet i'm going to get nice and
18:59dirty and rough I'm going to get a lot of product on there and then went to
19:02dust it out this is how I always go in with a brush for the first time and then
19:06I'll kinda like rub it on a paper towel beat it up a little bit the process I
19:09gotta show this bitch who's boss
19:31ok so because this brush to not make my contour on like precise and sharp i am
19:38going to just quickly do a little baking
19:40the only thing I ever do Scott that my face just bake away
19:55so I'm going to dust that off to clean up the lower half of the face and make
20:02it look much smoother more put together for blush I'm going to go in with this
20:09mix blush in the shade coral dream just like this
20:12Knicks have great blushes I love their blushes are very pigmented and they're
20:17very inexpensive which is just a bonus is going to pick that up and just go in
20:25short stroke emotions now for highlight i'm going to be going in with Bobby
20:34Brown bronze glow
20:36I'm not going on sheriff a paucity which is very hard for me because we actually
20:40look freaking course with this look
20:41but that's okay i'm going in with bronze glow because i'm trying not to you
20:46champagne pop so much even though it's my baby
20:57it drives me so crazy that my highlight looks like that on camera because I'm
21:01person as looks completely different person my highlight looks so smooth and
21:05blend it and then on camera
21:07it looks chunky and glittery and creepy and like clockwork almost every single
21:12time I need a subscriber you guys always Tony and my makeup looks a better person
21:16than it does on camera and I'm like why I need to figure out my lighting game
21:21but I mean I don't I do it all on my own like I don't have anyone to help me with
21:25my writing anything you like
21:27hire professionals to ask them like what I'm doing wrong because this is not the
21:32same
21:32oh ok so now for lips i'm going to be going in with her red
21:36um i have worn the captain lights for the night several times
21:41this is her collaboration with over cosmetics for a second liquid will be
21:44it's absolutely amazing the formula so beautiful
21:46it's nice and moisturizing it's not too dry and the color is gorgeous but today
21:51I'm going to go in with a true red
21:53this is ho ho ok just whatever ho ho
21:57by jeffree star so i'm going to be going in with this one I haven't used the
22:01shape yes i'm really excited to see it is liquid lipsticks they're so nice out
22:05of the password packaging their high-quality he is just awesome i love
22:08him
22:14it's serious it takes me it's such a long time to apply liquid lipstick or
22:17line my lips because my lips are naturally so on
22:21even like one side goes straight down and the other side is rounded and in
22:25this side goes straight down and then this side is so much like fatter and
22:30have it more meat in it my lips are so out of proportion I've always wanted to
22:34get lip filler to balance them out like temporary lip filler to see if it would
22:38look better but I don't kind of scares me but maybe one day but for now that's
22:43when they get this for last but not least I'm going to get a quick spritz of
22:48the indicator makeup setting spray to my face and we'll all right so here we have
22:55the finished look
22:56I actually just talk a little bit of gloss on my lips this is the Anasazi I
23:00Beverly Hills runway red lip gloss I just thought i would put it on so I
23:04never ever too glossy bold lips I'm very uncomfortable with it so i thought why
23:08not step out of my comfort zone and try a little ghouls
23:11um keep in mind that for this look you do not have to use false lashes if
23:15you're not comfortable false lashes if you never do saw flashes you do not need
23:19false lashes to complete this look just coating your own lashes with some
23:22mascara and giving them a curl will be more than enough
23:25the thing that really makes this look glamorous and festive is definitely the
23:29gold glitter liner and the bold red lips combined so I really hope that you guys

0:20when I had my Rihanna inspired makeup look a while back i asked you guys what
0:23celebrity would like to see next and hands down kylie jenner to the cake
0:27the reason it's taking me so long to get around to building this tutorial is
0:30because for the last couple of months i have actually been formulating a
0:33lipstick inspired by kylie jenner her lip color is just like crazy in the
0:38makeup world and the beauty industry people are just loving that the color
0:41and going bonkers over and so many people have been asking me what little
0:45combination i think it is what color I think it is and I thought to myself you
0:48know what I'm gonna figure this out
0:50so let's create one that's exactly what I did I tend to withdraw automatic and
0:53we created a kind of general inspired lip color
0:56I did the entire process I was so thinking about the formulation I was so
1:00good about the color that's why it took me such a long time and so so happy to
1:03introduce this color to you guys

1:38literally went to Instagram and stop this girl like boom screenshot probably
1:4230 pictures

2:23lipstick that I created thanks so much for watching this video and if you want
2:26to see you how to get this kylie jenner inspired makeup look
2:29then just keep watching bye guys
2:34i'm going to be using that whole lot more concealer to prime my eyes in the
2:37shade nw20 i'm going to go in with makeup geek purely naked who looks like
2:43this has just a little bit of sugar in it not too much though where it's not
2:46going to get in the way we're blending in our crease
2:48- very useful neutral brown color I'm going to take on a Bigfoot fluffy brush
2:52this is a e 40 from sigma i'm going to dust that in my crease area
2:56i'm also the resume you it because let's get real
2:59I know you want to see this bad boy up close yeah I am initially when i pick up
3:06that pigment starting on the outer edge so that that is the most intense and
3:09once there's not much product on the brush
3:11I'll bring it in work so this color is light i'm just going to blend it upward
3:19towards that brow area but i do not have very much and I rushed right now I'm
3:24just blending so we don't have any
3:25any harsh lines i am going to go in with a more d eyeshadow in the shade number
3:3162 it looks like this it is not a really warm or really cool eyeshadow it's right
3:36in between so it's a nice neutral shade and i love the tone of it is it's got
3:40some depth so we're going to take that on a smaller more precise timing brush
3:43and we're going to put that in the full crease area and yes these are more the
3:48eyeshadows the ones i was talking about my last video there are only two dollars
3:50a pop
3:51yes please so I'm going to start this outer corner I'm going to push it in
3:55that area and i'm going to bring around all the way about right here i'm not
4:01gonna bring it all the way and i'm going to bring it about right there and then
4:04blended back and forth on the actual lip because at this point i'm only working
4:12in the crease on the actual lid
4:14you can really just kind of bring this down however you want but I don't want
4:17the lid to be as dark as the crease area i want the main product to be right here
4:23in this section and then a little bit can come down this little area that's
4:27fine
4:29ok now I'm going to clean brush this isn't a 25 from sigma and then just with
4:35absolutely no products on it go over that entire crease area because we need
4:40to lend
4:47so now i'm going to go in and do my eyeliner and i'm going to use Maybelline
4:50eye studio gel liner in the shade black black I'm going to use an e 65 right by
4:55mu by Sigma this is my favorite eyeliner brush and just the perfect all angles
5:00nice and petite
5:01so what kinda typically does her eyeliner and she does a little wing and
5:04then she keeps it nice and bold on the outer corner and then trimmed it down
5:07really quickly and it ends right in this area where the eyelashes start to thin
5:12out so i'm going to show you exactly how to do that and what you're going to
5:15start with is the inner corner you're going to trace it right along the
5:18eyelashes i do much can't talk while I'm doing this because I'm talking my eyes
5:21moving it has to be really precise so i'll see you in a show you
5:33ok so as you can see i have literally just like dab right at the lash line and
5:38all i have created is just the finish line ever on my lash line and you
5:42honestly can't really tell that huge difference from the side to that I
5:46that's what we're going to start off with
5:47and now we're going to create the wing and once we follow it and we connect it
5:51to this little line that we have it will come together beautifully
5:54let's hope and I do have an eyeliner video that's kind of old something
5:58walking through this right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to follow the
6:01bottom lash out of my I up to towards the corner of my eye brow write like
6:05this and that is going to be the exact line i'm going to draw for my little
6:09wing them doing
6:17just like that so that line literally it goes from bottom lash line towards the
6:22brow
6:22that's exactly how you follow that and then if you do that on both eyes
6:27your wings will always be even so now i'm going to go ahead and connect the
6:31dots
6:57i'm going to be using the last of the Rimmel lash accelerator this is my
7:00favorite drugstore mascaras and I really really like it to curl my lashes before
7:03i go in with false lashes
7:05just because i think it makes a nice and long and separated and your lashes don't
7:09get in the way of your falsies sometimes using these two volumizing your lashes
7:13they can be too chunky and they can really stand out laying against your
7:17balls lashes so literally cannot decide which one should I want to wear these
7:21are both from house of lashes this one is called Bambi and these are called
7:24siren and I love them both and i do not know which one I want to do
7:28I'm kind of leaning towards Bambi ok so i have decided on Bambi my gosh these
7:37are so much
7:38fine all I'm doing is going out with the same gel liner that using the first
7:45place
7:46I'm just going over the band of that latches to cover it up I never liked to
7:49see the band of my false lashes
7:51even though it's obvious these are false I don't make them look even more faults
7:55and they need to look in the first place
7:56if you notice it so now i'm going to move arms my skin
7:59Kylie usually seems to have renounced looking is getting you know it's obvious
8:03that she's wearing foundation she's just not kicking it on and she typically is
8:06all mad that's something that I've noticed about her look is it is very
8:10rare that she does any sort of highlight the only highlight she will do is I can
8:14under i highlight with her concealer but it's still mad
8:17so I wanted to do a foundation that is not going to be doing whatsoever or give
8:21me a glow and make it forever is that foundation for me
8:24if your oily make it forever is going to probably make you a little doing but
8:26since I'm already so dry
8:28this is not going to make me look do you whatsoever i'm gonna look completely
8:31matte foundation will go sweets color so it works good
8:36I'm really going to spread this all over my face so that it's not too heavy so
8:46I'm going to a light application a foundation you can totally see my skin
8:50on
8:51using the camera but I can still see my little freckles and my blemishes but now
8:54i'm going to go in with nars radiant creamy concealer
8:58i'm using the shade custard and i'm going to apply this under my eye area
9:03i'm going in with a damn you wonder it's gonna make you more sure
9:16okay i'm going to just set that under eye concealer i'm going to be using the
9:20Anasazi of banana shade from her contour palette and I'm also been using mac and
9:24besides as always mix those together before this look I'm mainly using the
9:29anastacio banana shades and i'm just going to set this entire under eye area
9:34ok so now i'm going to go ahead and fill in my brows normal i am not in any way
9:39to try to replicate or duplicate had dinners I drive you completely different
9:44browse and i'm not going to go to come that road so I'm going to fill them in
9:46like I normally would
9:47one brown John wanted to go ok so now i'm going to shade mylar by Mac it looks
9:54like this right here
9:56it's a really really light shade have a pearlescent to it
9:59it's not shimmer and not Sparkle were just as a nice lean to it it just kind
10:04of reflects the light it's hard to explain it's a beautiful color very very
10:08neutral basic i'm going to use this to highlight underneath the brow bone
10:12because whatever she is using up there is extremely natural pretty much like
10:17she is nothing but i can see there's a little something
10:20i'm going to use that same I large touch on that inner corner for a really
10:26natural inner corner highlight i'm going to take a touch of black
10:33i'm using make a geek corrupt and I using i'm going to eat 15 black liner
10:38brush by Sigma i'm going to take this on that outer corner right here and match
10:43it up to that wing wire that we did earlier and just press it into that lash
10:48line only in the outer corner like that
10:54I'm going to go back with more key eyeshadow in the shade 62
10:57i'm going to use that to blend out this under eye area
11:03I'm going to buff that back and forth
11:11i'm going to be doing is bronze in my face because she really doesn't do much
11:15blush for faces look very natural just a little bit of color is touching the skin
11:19so i'm going to be using agar lactic map bronzer and shade Cabo start blending
11:25you
11:25I have never used this product before so this has been my first we'll see how it
11:29goes
11:32oh my god this bronzer is Georgina
11:40oh and the brush I'm using to apply this is by tom for I I can't talk about it

11:48i bought it anyways now I'm in love
11:50it was an impulse purchase and I'm sorry so last but not least we get to move on
11:54to the famous kylie jenner lip color and like I mentioned the beginning of the
11:57video i did create a lipstick inspired by the general lip color

12:09me
12:10- mom - Rosie Super Bowl i'm going to put on right now for you guys without
12:13any lip liner

13:31or dark eyeshadow something that matters have any shimmer on a blending brush and
13:35then just lightly put it underneath that bottom one just ever so slightly and
13:42that bring it down a little bit now that we don't watch on a rock brush and that
13:49creates a natural shadow making it look like that bottom lip is kind of folding
13:53over and make that a little slumber

14:06watching
0:00hey guys so today I'm going to be doing this natural glam makeup look for you
0:19and what I mean by natural lamb is we are going to be working with all neutral
0:22tones but it is still a glamorous look so this is a full face of makeup it is
0:27not like a five-minute natural makeup when you're running out the door
0:29it is a full face but instead of focusing on like dramatic winged liner
0:33or intense contour
0:34we're really going to be focusing on keeping everything soft and feminine and
0:37blurred out the point of this look is to really make it look like you are just
0:40glowing from within and just enhancing your natural beauty
0:45this is very on trend right now you see tons of celebrities wearing this look
0:48and tons of celebrity makeup artist wearing and doing this look right now so
0:51i just wanted to make a video showing you how you can achieve it for yourself
0:54every single person watching this video can do this look and it will look good
0:57on you and I can promise you that
0:59and it is so easy to achieve anybody can do this
1:02so I really hope that you enjoy this video as always i love you guys so much
1:06and I'll be seeing you soon
1:11all right guys the first thing I'm doing is throwing my hair up so that we are
1:15not distracted by it hanging all in my face
1:18we are going to be starting off with the skin today so i am going to prime my
1:21face using L'Oreal magic Lumi this is a light diffusing primer and went to warm
1:26it up on my fingertips and pressed it into my skin
1:29pressing primer and your skin will help with the longevity and make it work much
1:33better then we're going in with lush feeling younger this is a skin tent
1:38it is absolutely beautiful full it reflects light in all the right ways you
1:43can put on before foundation during foundation or after
1:46oh we are absolutely in love so i'm going to apply this all the cheekbones
1:50some of the forehead and chin
1:53wherever you want light to reflect then we are going in with a new foundation
1:58you guys are actually the ones who told me that i need this in my life and you
2:01are correct
2:02so this is the Chanel left Lumiere it is such a beautiful medium to full coverage
2:05foundation and i'm going to use as always my Sigma f80 kabuki brush and as
2:11you can see i am pressing this into the skin
2:14once again like we press the primer into the skin this will just help it lasts
2:17the longest and will give a nice dewy glow so just pressing all over the face
2:22as you can see it's a little bit darker but it does match my neck which is what
2:26I want to match then we are going in with mac pro longwear concealer and i'm
2:31using shape and w20 i'm just going to dab this on the skin with my fingers
2:36going all the way back toward the temple area and then grabbing the sigma f 86
2:41brush and blending this out
2:43this is not technically a concealer brush but I just recommend everyone uses
2:46it for concealer because it is absolutely beautiful
2:49don't forget to also run over the eyes to prime the eyes for the shadow that we
2:53will be going in with I also slightly go over my eyebrows it doesn't really
2:57matter but it can help to prime the eyebrows as well
3:00speaking of brows boom done I did use the anastacio caramel and ash blonde to
3:07fill in and then I'm going to go and sculpt again with that mac pro longwear
3:10concealer i will put my full brow tutorial down below in the description
3:15bar as always for you
3:16I just like stopped in my brows out
3:18like the way it looks just having a little bit more defined and other
3:21intense right now but it will all work out using the anastacio contour contour
3:25kit in the banana shade
3:27we're already hit pan and the mac pro emphasize powder
3:31what can i say some things never changed i'll be using this powder forever
3:34using the Sigma taper highlighting brush I'm going to dab
3:37as you can see literally dabbing motions I really prefer dabbing when i'm setting
3:42my concealer as opposed to rubbing and sweeping it really presses the powder
3:46into the skin and keep the concealer in place all day long I've never had an
3:51issue with my concealer breaking up at all then going in with the mac
3:56this is mac mineralize loose powder who can remember that for a second
4:01i'm going to just dab this almighty zone because i have an issue with my makeup
4:04breaking up in my t zone because I make so many facial expressions
4:08who would have thought then I'm going to kick it old school and use mac soft
4:12brown today for my eyes
4:13i'm going in with a sigma e40 brush which is just a big fat blending brush
4:17and I'm going all the way from inner corner to outer corner
4:21as you can see i'm not putting it all over the lid I am starting deep down the
4:25crease and working my way up
4:27so we're just going to blend blend blend and don't forget to practice patience
4:31while blending because it's definitely going to come in handy
4:34so just keep going all the way from air corner and our corner making it as dark
4:38as you please
4:38I've also done this look using a bronzer instead of an eye shadow and it's just
4:42as beautiful
4:43then we're going with mac texture its a Mac day what can i say who . for me for
4:48that right I'm going again and inner corner and the outer corner as you can
4:52see i'm leaving the ball of the eye
4:54blank you don't have to you can just continue to get this all over the eyelid
4:59but i'm just leaving the center of my eye with not much on it just focusing on
5:03the inner and outer corner and then make sure you go back and blend that out once
5:08again against again
5:10blend blend blend blend blend then we are going in with becca highlighter in
5:17opal
5:18haha I've been seeing the praises of this highlighter for a while now i just
5:22love it
5:23you can use any brush I'm using them
5:24- 52 brush tapping this all over the center of that lid which is why I left
5:28it blank and then as you come to the outer parts just start to lightly blend
5:33it out word once you don't have as much payment on that brush using mac fix plus
5:37i'm going to just dampen the brush to make it more intense
5:41you can use eye drops for this water won't really work but I drops will you
5:45can wet any shimmery eyeshadow
5:47max don't work but any shimmery eyeshadow will become more metallic and
5:51give more of a finish or a foiled application when you wet it with 6 plus
5:54i'm sadly not right on the center
5:57just for a little bit more intensity than going in with mac nylon such a
6:02beautiful highlight it's a yellow base make sure you are right handed with it
6:05because it is a very very intense highlight but as you can see it's
6:09absolutely gorgeous
6:11so just a tiny bit will go a very long way you can see i absolutely love love
6:16love this highlight and I'm going to curl my lashes very lightly and yes very
6:21lightly because we are going to use false lashes so you want to make sure
6:25that curl is not too intense
6:26otherwise it's going to be very hard to get false lashes on i am putting a coat
6:31of giorgio armani eyes to kill this is still my sample size , himself says i
6:36love it
6:37then we are going to pop on a pair of lashes these are bias quito they are
6:42mean clashes which looks so natural beautiful it is not always easy to wear
6:46false lashes without eyeliner but if you get it close enough to that lash line
6:50and you're very patient
6:51you can do it and it will look beautiful as you can see I'm squeezing just to
6:55make sure that there's no separation and boom
6:57beautiful just make sure that you get those tweezers in there and really
7:02squeeze that fall / with that natural lash obviously be aware of your skin but
7:07it will just keep it super super low so that you don't have any separation
7:11between your naturals and your falsies then we are going to just go in with any
7:16pencil brush and blending texture underneath that island
7:19starting in the outer corner i always like to start in the outer corner
7:22because i like the most intensity to be in the outer corner
7:25if you don't want the most intense thing at a corner you can start in the inner
7:27corner just once again
7:29don't forget to blend so many clients for the past few years have always had
7:33issues with their under eye area because they just don't like to spend time under
7:37blending so just don't give up keep blending back and forth constantly and I
7:42was going in with a smaller more precise brush just putting more of that texture
7:45shape just more densely up in those lashes just to fill them in so there's
7:49no gaps or separation then in the inner corner going in with nylon again just
7:54highlight you can see this highlight is moving so we have the highlight on the
7:59inner corner
8:00follow the eye and on the brow bone so those three areas of highlight on the I
8:04really are very flattering on everyone
8:06then going in with nar's long wearing eyeliner and rue bonaparte which is this
8:11beautiful nude that I go back to every single spring and summer
8:14i'm going to just line my waterline i'm not going to show you me doing this for
8:18a very long time
8:19just because my allergies have been off the chain and my eyes are so red right
8:24now I really don't watch myself to this forever either moving on we're going to
8:28just mascara the lower lashes and I feel like it's very important to put on a
8:32generous amount of mascara on the lower lashes when doing a look like this with
8:36a nude liner and the waterline and false lashes and sneeze them eyeliner ruined a
8:43whole sad day
8:45so i'm going to show you how we can clean this up wait about 40 to 60
8:49seconds and then get a q-tip and just wipe and literally it will just come off
8:53like a chalkboard like it never even happened
8:56do not try to take off any one mascara or eyeliner wait until it's dry then
9:00going on with Studio care blend pressed powder this is in shade medium deep
9:04because I'm pretty fair right now I'm going to grab a big that brush
9:09I don't know the number of this one I will listed below for you and I'm going
9:12to bronze the face we are not doing any contouring we are just bronzing but it's
9:17pretty much the exact same thing is contouring just not precise so we're
9:20just going to bronze the cheeks right underneath the cheekbone area on the
9:23temples around the forehead bottom part of the chin
9:27we just want to give a really beautiful sunkissed glow to the entire face
9:30make sure you don't put a lot on your forehead or knows you want to leave that
9:33area blank so just the outer
9:35part then kicking it old school going in with mac peaches blush if you guys have
9:41been a loyal follower of mine from the beginning
9:44you know I used to be obsessed with matt peaches I actually think I've gone
9:47through three of these blushes which is the most i've ever gone through a blush
9:51all my years working at mac i put this on everyone who walked into the store
9:55so I'm going to blend this with a mac 129 into my bronzer going backward
10:00even though it doesn't even though it doesn't have a sheen or shimmer in it
10:03it really gives a beautiful glow to the face compliments so many people
10:08everyone thinks it looks scary in person until you put it on it is such a
10:11gorgeous color I use it every spring and summer
10:15moving on going back with the Bekaa highlighter and opal we are going to use
10:20be Sigma taper highlighter brush once again and just dust this all over the
10:25top of that cheekbone bringing up to the side kind of by the eyebrow that will
10:29get a really beautiful glow especially when you're turning your face from side
10:33to side make sure that you do a light amount of this you do not want to be too
10:38generous with this because it is a very intense highlighter and it on the chin
10:43Cupid's bow and of course in the center of that knows you do not have to do all
10:47that if you don't look super glowy but I love lighting up like a disco ball
10:50then we're going in with anastacio clear brow gel just so that are brown hairs
10:54are not flapping all over our face throughout the day because my will fall
10:57and look a hot mess and there's this there's just nothing worse
11:01ok really first world problems then we're going to go in with mac Japanese
11:05maple i am using all my old staples today I just love love this color it is
11:10such a beautiful nude and you can finish it like this and just do a super new lip
11:14which of course totally gorge
11:16but instead we are going to go on top of that with the new mac mineralize gloss
11:20and be nice
11:21which is such a pretty coral rosy shade
11:26I absolutely love these formulas they're such great losses so just mixing that is
11:30going to be a nice glossy nude coral shade absolutely perfect
11:35so that completes our look I hope you guys enjoy thank you so much for
11:39watching i love you all so much and I'll see
0:11hello my love
0:15today's video isn't making sure how many lives are going to change before
0:19embarrassing myself in front of thousands of people moving a lot
0:22today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look that i am wearing
0:25right here and I'm super excited for today's video because it isn't all
0:28affordable makeup look which I am very very excited about the only thing that I
0:34kind of skipped over was the brows i use the Anasazi of Broadway's but I figured
0:38you guys would forgive me because you know how it is with the brows it's like
0:41don't mess with the brown
0:43I saw recently a ton of requests on like two videos ago for an affordable or
0:48drugstore makeup look
0:49so I was like let's do it i also saw your quest incorporating cool tones into
0:54a smoky eye
0:54so we did that as well which is very outside of my comfort zone let me just
0:58say when I was going in with the cool tones in my crease like because I always
1:02work with neutrals or warms all myself because I just don't love cool tones on
1:07me but I actually do like this look right now I really like how it turned
1:11out so I am comfortable with this
1:13and i also saw a time of you guys asking for me to work with the jaclyn hill
1:17favorites palette that I design with more feet last December so I thought I
1:21would bring that back for this video
1:23so we're doing cool toward the jackal favorites palette and we're doing an
1:27affordable look at one video so I'm trying to me as many requests as
1:30possible
1:31if you don't own this palette don't worry they sell the shadows individually
1:35for two dollars a piece so I will go ahead and list them down below for you
1:38guys at which ones i am using so if you do want to purchase these you can go
1:41ahead and purchase the exact same colors that are in this palette for yourself
1:45online so don't feel like left out because you don't have this gallery
1:48thing like that you know saying I also want to say really quickly that i use in
1:52the elf blush palette today for the first time ever a subscriber recommended
1:56this me so I immediately went out and bought it a couple of days ago and you
1:59guys have seen me use this palette which is the morphe 9b palette I
2:04I love this palette I don't just love this palette for its affordability
2:08I can't look at this palette say oh yeah it's good for the price like no this
2:11palette is just good like these blushes are good they're pigmented their
2:15blendable they're soft I love them but i wanted to try something different today
2:18because I just got these a couple days ago and I was really excited to try them
2:22i will say they're just as pigmented as the morphe brushes
2:25the only difference is the more key ones have a little bit more blendabilities
2:29there a little bit creamier but other than that they had the same pigment on
2:33so the more he was gonna be easier to work with but still if you're looking
2:35for a great inexpensive blush palette to grab at your local drugstore this alpha
2:40one was really good i just want to mention that before jumping into the
2:43video because this was my first time using this and so that's like my little
2:46baby mini review on it i hope you guys enjoy this video and if you do get a big
2:51thumbs up and please subscribe
2:53i love you guys so much you know i mean it and i'll see you soon alright so
2:58first thing we're going to do today is prime our face
3:00i'm using the Loreal light infusing a primer this is my favorite drugstore
3:04primer because i am very dry so this helps give me like a radiant glow to the
3:09skin and makes the foundation glide on just a little bit easier and today for
3:13foundation I'm going to be mixing the original Lori true
3:16l'oreal true match and the L'Oreal True Match Lumi i'm using shade w4 and both
3:20foundations the original one is just a little bit too dry for me but the
3:24looming one can be very luminous so I want to mix them together to kinda get
3:28the best of both worlds
3:29so I am using a more p.m. for 39 foundation brush as always to blend this
3:33into the skin and this is a very affordable foundation brush as well if
3:37you're looking for a good one this one is bomb
3:40now i'm going to going in with concealer and i am using the Maybelline master
3:44concealer i really really like this concealer
3:48I am blending it out with a real techniques sponge which is basically the
3:52same thing as a Beauty Blender but again it's more affordable and i love this
3:55I've been choosing it over my beauty blender for the past month
3:58it's super big one side having a flat side and the other side is like a point
4:01is you can really get up in the corner of your eyes and blend everything out so
4:05fat and squishy and i love it
4:08now i'm going to go in with a next highlight and contour kit
4:12and i'm going to be using a more p.m. for 38 brush to use these two middle
4:17shades together on the under eye area just to set my concealer i normally use
4:21the anastacio powder and the map emphasize but these do the exact same
4:25thing and they did a great job so I'm just going to be blending that out on
4:29the entire under eye area and then i will also put that on the island as well
4:33so that my shadows blend a little bit better now i'm going to be going in with
4:36the morphe jaclyn hill favorites palette which is so like awkward to say that but
4:40anyways i am using this kind of medium tone warmish neutral brown that you saw
4:46all the way to the left side the palette i will put the exact numbers and names
4:49down below for you guys if you don't own this palette and i am using a sigma e40
4:53to dust this all over in the crease area
4:56I like to initially go in with a neutral or a warm shade because if I go in was
4:59just nothing but cool colors you can sometimes look like I've been punched in
5:03the eye
5:04so I always like to start with kind of a peachy warm or neutral base to blend
5:08everything out and then pack on the cool shade on top of that i'm going to go in
5:13with the first cool tone brown right here and I'm going to be using a what is
5:17this more fee and 433 brush to apply this in my crease area
5:21I'm going to go all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner I'm
5:24going to keep this as low as possible because again i do want to bring this
5:28too high up
5:29because that's when you're i can start to look a little bruise when working
5:32with cool tones so I keep this really low and that crease as you can see i'm
5:35really hollowing out back and forth and then once there's less product on the
5:39Block brush i will begin to blend upward in that warm color to kind of combine
5:44the both of them into a neutral shade
5:46now i'm going to go in with an even duck cool tone brown which is the one right
5:50next to the one that we just picked up and using the exact same brush I'm going
5:53to do the same step right in the crease of my eye I'm going to go back and forth
5:56and really carve out this crease area if you do not have a defined crease and
6:01that's okay you can create one and do the same step and full people that you
6:05have a deep set crease even if you don't that's the beauty of makeup
6:09if i seemed distracted or i'm laughing I'm looking around I'm talking it's
6:12because my mom is in the room she was on the phone and she had on speaker so i
6:15could be a part of the conversation but I'm like I'm still filming
6:18even if you're going to be behind the camera so that's why I seem a little
6:21distracted at times anyways once you don't have as much product on you
6:25brush you want to blend upward that is like the biggest part and blending out
6:29your shadow and making it really seamless
6:32now we're going to grab the shade right next to those are the two Browns that
6:34we've been using this whole time which is kind of a neutral kind of cool tone
6:39sandy brown that's how I'm describing it and any synthetic brush will do to pack
6:44this on the lid
6:45i'm going to go over a couple of times to really make that color a little bit
6:48brighter
6:49if you want to spray your brush with some fix+ that would be great
6:52you want to I actually tried spreading my brush with the law real makeup
6:55setting spray and it just was not having it at all it was not it didn't have
7:00glitter in it so it wasn't really sticking and giving that metallic look
7:03but you could use eye drops and that would also wet your brush and it would
7:06give it a little bit more sticking power if you want your eyes to really listen
7:10so now i'm going to go in with lore'l smoldering eyeliner
7:13this is a creamy Cole liner and i am going to just put this all over the lash
7:17line as you can see I'm not really trying to make it perfect but I want to
7:21keep it more on the thin side and right on the lash line and then I'll take any
7:25sort of small definer brush and just very lightly kind of smoke that out i
7:29don't want to be too smoky though
7:31but i just wanted to be a soft liner not to black not too intense not too smoky
7:34which is a little bit of definition on the lashes so that we don't leave the
7:38lash line completely blank but I didn't want to do like a dramatic cat I today
7:42now i'm filling in the brows as always and I am just using the Anasazi or
7:46browse in the shade hope I tried the I think it's by NYX the NYX brow pencil I
7:52think maybe was NYC and it was just so hard to use I just stuck with the
7:56Anastasio one that one which is super dry i don't know if i got like a dud and
8:00if they're usually good but it just wasn't working for me so I just stuck to
8:03what I know so that I didn't mess up his eyebrows
8:07so I go a lot lighter on the inner corner and then I go much heavier on the
8:10outer tail and I just blend it all out with the spoolie now we're going to go
8:14in with lashes and i'm using house of lashes in the style
8:18siren these are very fluffy and I refer to them as daytime lashes but for some
8:23they are not daytime lashes but they're very fluffy and very beautiful without
8:28being really over the top and dramatic
8:30so I am using the Loreal voluminous mascara and carbon black and I'm only
8:34putting this mascara on the very base of the
8:37ashes and the reason I do this is because it really helps blend the lashes
8:40with your fake ones but at the same time I don't want to take it up all the way
8:45out all the lashes because it can really kill the longevity of wearing these
8:48lashes multiple times not to mention it can make them look noticeably fake so i
8:52just do it at the very root and base of the lashes
8:55now i'm going to mix the two highlighting shade from this palette 1
8:59it has a little bit of a pinky undertone and the other one has a little bit of a
9:02yellow undertone so I mix them together to make it a little bit more neutral and
9:05using any synthetic brush just pop this at the high point of the brow bone and
9:09then blend it down along the tale of the brow
9:12if you want more of a natural daytime look you can skip this but you know me
9:15I'm always going to add the drama for you so that you can see how it looks now
9:18using the same a l'oreal smoldering eyeliner I'm just going to align my
9:22entire water line because we are going to smoke this out a little bit and once
9:26I've done that I'm going to go in with this really super dark brown has a
9:29little bit of a purple undertone in it for the lower lash line any definer
9:33brush i'm just going to pack this really tightly up against that lower water line
9:38so that the black liner and this doc brown can kind of mix together and
9:42become its own little special cocktail and then using a pencil brush I'm going
9:45to blend out the whole lower lash line all the way back and forth
9:48i always suggest putting a light brown shade on the pencil brush because it'll
9:52really help get that lower lash line nice and seamlessly blended and then
9:56basic where it's going to go in and apply some mascara to the lower lashes
10:00again i am using the Loreal voluminous and carbon black because i like my
10:05lashes black just like my heart but I couldn't resist i'm sorry i'm going to
10:11be bronzing my face and I'm using the morphe for brush to apply the jane
10:16bronzing powder and a shade inspire love this brush and love this bronzer these
10:20two together are amazing i think this bronzer is so great it's so blendable
10:25it's very light
10:26so I like that it's not orange and i like that i actually have to pack it on
10:29to get some color because you can sometimes go overboard bronzer right and
10:32you're like whoa
10:33why does it look like I have an orange blob on my face or it can look muddy but
10:36this one
10:37you really have to pack it on to get the shade to show up which I kind of
10:40appreciate because you won't go overboard to easily so it's going to
10:44blend that out all around the cheek area down on the job on the forehead the
10:47temples basically everywhere except the center of the face
10:50and i'm going to go in with my blush palette and this is by elf and this is
10:54in the shade dark they have a light one and a dark one
10:56and i'm using the doc one and i'm going to mix these two shades together one is
11:00like a raspberry any other one is a pink
11:02you can see how pigmented this is it is like it's pigmented and i'm using that
11:06exact same
11:07p for brush my morphe to blend this out and i'm really going to make sure i work
11:12at blending this out because it is really pigmented they aren't that crazy
11:15blendable but that's okay because they're so pigmented that my group worth
11:19it
11:20so now i'm going to make these to highlight shades in the Knicks highlight
11:23and contour palette and I'm using the morphe and 501 brush to apply this and
11:27look how pretty this highlight turned out
11:29it's so pretty I mean it's definitely white it's not like a champagne color or
11:34a gold color but i just think that it's such a beautiful highlight shade so i'm
11:38going to put a little bit out on my chin and a tiny bit of it on the side of my
11:40nose and really blend that out so we can get a nice glow going on because you
11:44know
11:45strobing is all the thing of this fall so I'm now going to line my lips using
11:49the revlon colorstay lip liner in the shade chocolate which this color does
11:53not like chocolate to me right like it looks like such a berry fault I'm shade
11:58it doesn't like chocolate but that's okay
11:59any lip liner will work i'm going to go with a super super dark lip but i just
12:03wanted to line my lips because this is going to kind of act as a base to keep
12:07the lipstick that we're going to put on next in place so it doesn't slide all
12:11over our face and now i'm going to go in with an oldie but a goodie and this is
12:14revlon black cherry any of my OG subscribers will remember this from like
12:18the first six months that i was on youtube so i thought we would bring it

1:39thanks for watching i love you and I'll see you soon
1:41I I wouldn't room Annie fashion if you don't like it
1:44please don't watch it I mean it's not exactly how he says it but you know I'm
1:48trying to be a lady here on my channel
1:50hm you know I am a quick disclaimer my spray tan is bad
1:55this is not cute on my wrist so throughout the video orange hands orange
1:59everything
1:59uh it's not good so I want to throw that out there yes I'm aware this rate as bad
2:04it's not a good situation
2:06all right let's do this thingy first things first I'm going to prime my eyes
2:10and I'm going to be using the Too Faced shadow insurance
2:12I typically use a concealer and then set it with powder for my eye primer which I
2:16actually do prefer but for some reason i was just i don't know i was in a mood
2:20and I was like you know what we're going to do this today so that's what I did
2:23now i'm going to be going in with the man emu a and makeup geek eyeshadow
2:26palette and I'm going to be grabbing beaches in cream right here top Center
2:31taking any fluffy brush that you love and you trust and you have a long-term
2:34committed relationship with going to go in and just blend that out all the way
2:38from the outer corner to the inner corner
2:40as you can see beaches and cream pretty much doesn't show up on me especially
2:42when I have a spray tan like I do right now I'm still gonna throw it in there
2:45just for good faith and it'll help blend out the next colors
2:48I'm going to be mixing sora and frappe and I'm going to do the exact same thing
2:52as i do with peaches and cream i'm going to take these two colors and i'm going
2:55to go from inner corner to outer corner all the way back and forth and
2:59windshield wiper motions
3:00I'm putting the heaviest of the pigment right there in the crease of my eye
3:03if you do not have a crease in your eye you can just create one just pick a
3:07place and go back and forth and windshield wiper motions and then
3:10whatever is left over on my brush
3:12I will just lightly kind of blend upward as you see me doing right now but I
3:15don't have barely any pigment on my brush at that point
3:18now i'm going to mix Mars and Aphrodite Mars is like a really intense kind of
3:23reddish raspberry and Aphrodite is a really kind of beautiful true deep dark
3:27brown
3:28I'm going to mix those two together to get almost like the color of like
3:31chocolate cherries i want to say I'm going to take again any fluffy brush
3:36that you love this is the more p.m. 4 3 3 i'm going to keep this a little bit
3:39lower than I did with the first shade since it is so dark and i'm really gonna
3:42go heavy in the crease itself as you can see I'm being very sloppy on the lid
3:46because i don't care how that looks
3:48I'm not gonna worry about blending that out because i'm going to cover that up
3:51with another shade in just a few moments I'm only going to worry about blending
3:54out the top area in the crease so i will go back with another fluffy brush which
3:59is a little bit more of either frappe or saw just any light brown you could grab
4:03beaches and cream and we're just going to go over that area nice and slow and
4:07very
4:08soft just to slightly blend out those edges without making them come too high
4:12or look too jagged
4:14now i'm going to pick up cosmopolitan which is a really beautiful kind of
4:17Rosie golden shade and grabbing a mac 242 brush I did wet my brush a little
4:22bit with fix plus i'm going to begin
4:25just to put this all over the entire lid and at first I was like do I only one
4:29purpose in the inner corner and kind of fade out I wasn't quite sure but then I
4:32ended up doing a really intense it almost creates like a an illusion of a
4:37cut crease because I want my brush and I made it so metallic i'm going to really
4:41use this brush to make it really intense so my lid color is just strictly
4:46cosmopolitan and then that darker chocolate cherry shade is just strictly
4:51in the crease so that's what i decided to do with that and then I packed on
4:54glitter later I just love the way it all came together
4:57I'm going and just making it a little bit darker in the crease area because I
5:01just thought that it is a little bit more extra what I had on cosmopolitan
5:04now for liner
5:06i am using the Maybelline gel liner I swear to god you guys like this is still
5:11my favorite gel liner is my favorite gel liner forever like nothing compares to
5:15it
5:15everything smudges nothing lasts nothing is as black as I wanted to be like this
5:19is the most bomb liner ever and it's from the drugstore you can get a
5:22walgreens CVS alta it's my favorite gel liner of all time so i am doing a wing
5:27but I'm going to keep it a little on the thin side this is at least 10 for me
5:30because i love a big huge intense
5:32whoa I like a big intense thick week but I'm going to keep this one small so I'm
5:37going to go in with a little bit of the two-faced glitter glue
5:40this is my absolute favorite way to apply glitter it's the best glitter glue
5:44out there
5:44it doesn't separate it doesn't like it really is super glue for glitter it
5:48keeps on your eyes it's not going to fall off throughout the night
5:51it really does stay in place it's a gorilla glue for your eyeshadow it's
5:55amazing so I will pack it on with a brush and I'll grab glitter and almost
5:59immediately pack the glitter on right over top of it you want to make sure you
6:01do it fairly quickly because once the glue dries it doesn't serve the same
6:05purpose you want that glue to still be tacky on the lid when you're packing on
6:08the glitter and since I am packing on so much glitter
6:11by the way i'm using eye candy glitter in the shade taffie such a gorgeous
6:15color
6:16it's like a rose gold kind of coppery pink it went perfect with this
6:19I look
6:20this is the same girl I was also wearing in my last video because a lot of you
6:23guys were asking so i will find it link it down below for you
6:26I'm just covering up my eyeliner again so i don't have a glitter all over my
6:29liner because that is definitely a pet peeve of mine is when you have glitter
6:32all over the liner so I always make sure to cover that up on myself and then i'm
6:35going to pop on some lashes and i'm using flutter lashes and the style
6:39Ashley these are such a cool ash they're like very wispy very long but yet
6:45they're not super duper thick so you can still see through them and see the
6:49eyeshadow look if you know what I'm saying
6:50now i'm going to prime my skin and i'm using this ridiculously bougie YSL
6:55primer
6:56um I don't know the exact name of it but again i find it below I'll find it all
6:59this if you guys down below but it's a blurring primer it's my second time
7:02using it and i really like it
7:03we're gonna kick it old school with the giorgio armani a luminous silk
7:06foundation
7:08i am using the morphe and 439 foundation brush to apply this I swear this
7:14foundation is just so good like if you've been around my channel for a
7:17while you know this was pretty much a foundation I use for a solid eight
7:20months and I haven't used it in a long time have been trying to foundations
7:24I went back to this one and I'm just like oh I missed you so much it's just
7:28such a good foundation i forgot how much I loved it
7:31so then for concealer i'm going to you know just past the entire bottle on my
7:35face no big deal
7:36i'm going to be using the Urban Decay a weightless naked concealer this like i
7:40said before my favorite concealer of all time I have gone everyone addicted to it
7:44i've got my mom addicted I've got my sister I've got my friends I've got my
7:47cousins
7:48I've got everybody to do this concealer I swear works for everyone i know it's
7:52so beautiful it is so weightless
7:54it doesn't get a crazy mess it's not too oily it's not too creamy it's it's it's
7:59the most beautiful concealer ever I swear like urban decay has like some
8:02voodoo going on in their lives because they created the most incredible
8:05concealer of all time so i am putting that under my eyes forehead nose and a
8:09little on the chin and I'm going to grab the anastacio banana powder and I'm
8:13going to pack that wherever I put the concealer so i use a pretty light amount
8:17and I am blending out with a really really fluffy brush
8:20this is the e3 it's part of the more feet Elite Collection and as you can see
8:23it is really yellow and the reason i like that is because it's going to help
8:26- really bright in
8:27my face and especially once i put on bronzer it'll just kind of pull the
8:31whole look together everything will look nice and light and fresh
8:35now we're going to go in and contour using my favorite contour powder and my
8:38favorite contour brush this is my favorite way of contouring as far as the
8:43brush goes this is the m5 23 brush my morphe i am obsessed i think it's the
8:48most amazing contour brush I used to love the NARS e21 and now this has taken
8:52over my holy grail because it just makes it softer and more blendable and easy to
8:56apply it's just it's beautiful
8:57and then for the actual powder i'm using Mac shade stir you can find on mac
9:01cosmetics calm and I realized the center of my forehead was looking dingy and
9:05dirty so I grabbed a little bit of that Anastasio banana powder and i lightened
9:09it up
9:09my face looks really like because i was so dark like darkly spray-tanned but
9:13once everything oxidizes in like 30 minutes I will get a little bit darker
9:17my face will match my body a little bit more
9:20I'm going to grab the rcn day and no color powder and i'm going to just put
9:24this right there going from the corner of my lip to the corner of the top of my
9:28ear not quarters right corner of my lip to the top of my tea i'm going to make a
9:31line going to let that sit while I finish my makeup and then it will just
9:34sharpen my contour got it from the brows what you gotta do when you see that
9:39extra hair grow and just get rid of it
9:41I do not suggest is going in with scissors to your browse by the way if
9:44you haven't done it before like first go to a professional don't chop off your
9:47browser ladies my best friend literally took scissors to her eyebrows when she
9:51was 12 years old it was the saddest thing ever
9:53oh my god girl i still feel for you i'm filling in my brows using the Anasazi a
9:58brow definer i feel this is the only black pencil never going to use for the
10:01rest of my life I'm so obsessed that makes it so quick and easy and then i'm
10:05going to go in and grab the highlighting shade from the man emu a pallet and this
10:09is the color artemis on the kind of its kinda reminds me of mac nylon in a sense
10:13it's a really beautiful highlight and it's got a little bit like a yellow
10:16sheet and it's gorgeous so I'm going to pack a little bit of that only the high
10:19point of the brow and then a teeny tiny bit on the very inner corner of the eye
10:23just to keep things kind of nice and bright and I'm going to grab a frappe
10:27and then
10:28and just any pencil brush and I'm going to just run this over the lower lash
10:31line
10:31I want this to be darkest and most intense on the very outer corner
10:35that's just a personal preference for me though that has nothing to do with the
10:38look
10:38that's just the way I like it on my eye shape is i like it to be the darkest and
10:42I get to come down the lowest on the outer corner of the eye that I'm
10:46grabbing a little bit of Aphrodite I didn't show a shot of it but that's what
10:49i'm doing right now is that super dark brown and then pack that on super super
10:53tight to my lashline like literally in my lashes on my lash line as close as
10:58possible and then i will blend it back out with more frappe
11:02you can grab some Mars and go in and blend that out if you want to make it a
11:04little more rise Barry under there that's totally up to you and then I'm
11:08going to grab mac cosmetics fascinating i call this is like stark white like is
11:13white as paper it's not creamy it's not a nude it is white but i wanted to use
11:17it today to really make the colors pop and also make my eyes stand out as well
11:21then i'm going to go in with a blush and i'm using the sephora brand blush in the
11:25shade
11:25tangerine tease I was online shopping a couple weeks ago on sephora.com and I
11:30just tried a couple of these i bought some of them because I've never tried
11:33before brand blush and some of them i don't really love but this one I think
11:36is really really beautiful it's got some nice shimmer and it's a beautiful coral
11:40i'm going to go ahead and just erase that bacon if you will to reveal a nice
11:44shot contour if this is too sharp for you totally understandable go back with
11:49your contour brush ever so lightly and just lightly go over it and it will make
11:53it a little bit more buff out but I'm going to keep it nice and sharp girl i'm
11:57going to go in with this malli face and cheek palette i discovered this because
12:00of kathleenlights and I'm not gonna lie i ordered on amazon for like two times
12:04the price because I'm just that kind of girl when someone's reading about
12:07something I'm like oh I have to have it i'll do i need to do to get my hands on
12:11this bad boy but can we talk about this highlight no let's just take a moment of
12:15silence for the highlight
12:16oh my god I can't breathe okay i'm gonna take that same highlight i'm going to
12:20put on the Cupid's bow
12:22this is just a little trick to make the mouth look a little bit powdery ER and
12:26i'm going to take a latte and I'm going I'm sorry
12:28frappe and i'm going to just coat that all over the bottom lip again you will
12:32see it's going to give it more of a shadow to make it look like it is fuller
12:36now i'm going to go in with mac cosmetics subculture lip pencil
12:40i just purchased this last week because this used to be my favorite lip pencil
12:43ever when i worked at mac i wore every day with every shade of knew that you
12:47can think of it was my go-to color and I just remember like why don't you use
12:51that color anymore so I jumped online and i bought it and I'm in love with it
12:54all over again
12:55it's such a good everyday lip liner like it's just the perfect color for
12:59day-to-day lips at least for me it is a great neutral and i'm going to go in
13:03with the Ariana Grande and mac cosmetics
13:05Viva Glam gloss if you guys don't know about the mac viva glam program it's
13:09amazing
13:10one hundred percent of the proceeds go to men women and children living with
13:13and affected by HIV and AIDS so it's always nice to know that your money is
13:16going to a great organization whenever you buy a Viva Glam gloss or lip sticks
13:21so last but not least I'm going to just cut my lower lashes with some mascara
13:24because i forgot to do this and I looked at myself in all right way
13:27something missing so i'm using the mac extended play mascara which is my
13:31favorite for lower lash and then this look is complete
13:34I hope you guys enjoy the video thanks so much for watching i love you and i'll
13:37see you in my next video bye guys
0:18hey guys today's video I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look
0:23that you see right here i need to come up with a different row my goodness
0:27gracious
0:28every single he got me like it's been like almost four years i think i'm still
0:33doing the same intro really rockin
0:35I am ridiculously obsessed with this makeup look I'm trying so hard not to
0:39stare at myself in the viewfinder and seem like a total narcissist because
0:41every two seconds I want to be like hmm i don't remember the last time I loved
0:45my makeup look as much as I love this one like this like filled up my cup if
0:50you know what I mean like I just feel like alive with this makeup look on
0:53and the reason I'm putting this tutorial for you guys is because i was wearing
0:56the same look a couple days ago and i was on snapchat that day and I went over
1:00to Twitter and I could not believe how many requests there were from you guys
1:04treating me to film this makeup for you guys
1:06so that is exactly what I did you know how it works so wish is my command
1:09that's how we do it around here but i did just kind of spice it up a little
1:14bit i added lashes that are a little bit more dramatic and I made my lower
1:17lashline pop just a little bit more
1:19I just feel like every time I do the same look like a second time it gets
1:23better like the first time I like it but the second time I usually love it and
1:26keep that in mind because if you try to look one time and you're not like crazy
1:30in love
1:30give it a second shot I feel like the more you do something more you can
1:33perfect it like practice makes perfect and i'm saying so
1:36yes I am so in love with this colorful liner trend I know colorful liners are
1:39really in every single spring and summer but this year it's everywhere and brands
1:44have been coming out with more colorful liners which I just love so much
1:48I've seen so many gorgeous looks with colorful liners on Instagram there was
1:51this one girl that you like a smoky black eye with a white liner is so
1:54gorgeous i saw in the popular page on Manny he recently did a makeup look
1:59using the same exact liner i think i think it was the same exact liner a
2:04couple weeks ago his look was much more subtle than this so if you want to check
2:07that out
2:08totally beautiful but yeah i'm just i'm in love with this i really wanted to a
2:12yellow liner like a yellow line would be really fun and different but i'm trying
2:16to think of how it would work i think like a turquoise like almost like sea
2:20foam
2:21we have a gorgeous like a yellow liner and
2:23I'm dying and rambling i love this look and I hope that you guys maybe get some
2:28inspiration to jump outside of your comfort zone and try something different
2:31like a weed colorful either because it's just so much fun not to mention it's
2:34like fun for everybody around you every single time you blink it's like but a
2:38nice surprise for all of your friends and family so I hope that you guys enjoy
2:41this video thanks for watching i love you and I'll see you guys soon
2:44no right please God no I don't want to get glam I want to go back to bed
2:49I'm just kidding okay i want to start by priming my eyes I'm using any concealer
2:55that's just the way i prime it
2:57i'm using a dry Beauty Blender just to blend that out you can use your finger a
3:00damp Beauty Blender a brush
3:02it doesn't matter this is just the way i prime my eyes it's what works for me
3:05after I had my entire eyelid covered with a thin amount of concealer i will
3:09just a little bit of powder over a translucent powder
3:12it can be like a setting powder it doesn't matter just anything to make it
3:15Matt and first and foremost i'm going to be going in with makeup geek
3:19chickity since we're going to be going in with reds and corals and kind of
3:22picky shades today i wanted to go in with chickadee
3:24first it is one of my favorite all-time colors for the crease when i'm doing a
3:28warm smoky eye and i am using a sigma e40 which is one of my oldies but
3:32goodies it's a great blending brush and as you can see i'm bringing it all the
3:36way to the inner corner to the outer corner and I'm keeping it very low on
3:39the entire crease area and then once i have basically no product left as you
3:43see I bring it up basically all the way towards my brow and that's how we get
3:46that really seamless blending perfection look that we want on the ice
3:50now i'm going to go in with more fiesta this is a single eyeshadow by morphy
3:54recently I'm package like every single morphy eyeshadow like a couple weeks ago
3:58and put them in pallets and so I've been kind of dabbling around them more and
4:02more and so I'm going to do the exact same thing with this that I do a
4:04chickadee and put it just directly over the first color right there in my crease
4:08then i'm going to reach for makeup geek
4:10morocco I don't know why I just discovered this eyeshadow like why have
4:14I not been using this every day of my life
4:16welcome home mama you are now a part of the family how long with this eyeshadow
4:20is so gorgeous as you can see me doing the exact same thing and bring this one
4:24down on my lid a little bit more than the rest
4:26just because i felt like it there wasn't really no rhyme or reason I was just
4:29having fun and I'm going to grab Mac red brick going to be honest you guys it is
4:34not necessary to put on four different shades of corals and oranges
4:37it is so totally not but just because this is one of my favorite colors to
4:41work with I wanted to utilize as many of my shadows as possible but honestly can
4:45do this with two or three of the shadows you do not need all of them
4:48I'm grabbing anastacio burnt orange which is such a beautiful kind of
4:52caramel camel shade if you're like a doctor all complexions would be such a
4:57beautiful shade for your transition right there in your crease for an
5:00everyday color it's so gorgeous
5:02picking up another blending brushes the morphe and 4 3 3 i'm going to do is just
5:06grab a little bit more of that makeup geek morocco and Anasazi burnt orange
5:09and just put a little bit more intense and make it a little bit deeper in my
5:12crease because i want to just a little bit more like pronunciation in the
5:16crease area
5:17so then I'm going to pick up the new tart clay pot waterproof liner and this
5:22is in the shade
5:23mint and I'm going to be applying this the exact same way that I would apply
5:27any regular basic black liner except honey today we in basic
5:32I want to make this pretty thick honestly I felt like when I was done
5:35with the entire locals like I could have made this wing even thicker you can
5:38honestly go as thick and dramatic as you want with this wing because it's already
5:42such a fun bold look it will just add to it and grow up you're gonna do it do the
5:45damn thing right
5:46i have to of course obsessed over my wings to make sure they're even because
5:50I'm not being funny you guys it's not normal I'm such a perfectionist with my
5:54makeup if my wings aren't even I will literally wipe off my makeup and just
5:56leave the house with no makeup I rather have no makeup and uneven liner because
6:00i am that I'm a psychopath ok moving on
6:03I'm cutting my lashes with mascara to make sure that I don't have any of that
6:06eyeliner like stuck on it so that my natural lashes blow up my fake lashes
6:10really nicely and i'm going to be using the lower lashes and fluff and wispy
6:15these are probably the number one or two favorite dramatic lashes I think they're
6:20so gorgeous and now i'm going to move on to the face and I'm going to be priming
6:24it using my favorite primer right now which is the backlight priming filter it
6:29just gives such a gorgeous radiance to the skin
6:31if you're dry and you want radiance girl this primer is bomb and I'm going to
6:35grab my L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion foundation and i'm going to take my
6:40foundation brush like I just take it and directly put it into the center of that
6:43cushion
6:44I don't press really hard because it can get full coverage really quickly
6:47i press like halfway down and i am using the morphe and 439 brush to blend this
6:51out
6:52this is my all-time favorite foundation brush a bar ever ever I've gone through
6:57a lot of obsession with a lot of foundation brushes and this is my
7:00absolute number one I feel like no matter what i try i always go back to
7:02this guy right here and then I'm going to pick up my favorite concealer ever
7:06and this is the Urban Decay Naked weightless concealer we put this on the
7:09entire under eye area and I know it looks like it's a lot but that's because
7:12it is i'm going to use a damp Beauty Blender though and using the damp Beauty
7:17Blender makes it so that even if you apply too much concealer it will pick up
7:21the excess and just make the under eyes look so natural which is why i have been
7:25die hard for a Beauty Blender for like the past two years now I'm going to grab
7:28the Anasazi a banana powder
7:31i'm going to set my under eye area i'm only using the banana powder today and
7:34I'm not mixing with anything else because i didn't want the under eye to
7:37be to highlighted I didn't want to be too shiny or to radiate I just wanted it
7:40to look really nice and soft with the rest of the skin and now using a fluffy
7:44brush I'm going to just apply a shear amount of powder no additional coverage
7:47just wanting to kind of slightly modify myself so I'm not super duper do we eat
7:51and then i'm going to go in with ardency Inn liner in the shade
7:55lilac oh these liners are my number one favorite liners in the game
8:00they're so creamy they stay so long my inner line and it kind of frustrating me
8:04because you can't really see the color popping on camera button person this
8:07color was gorgeous and I'm going to grab Mac deep damson this is a matte kind of
8:12wine
8:13purple shade and i'm going to take a definer brush any definer brush anything
8:17small precise will do we take it all the way from my lower lashes
8:21we're like my mint green liner ends i'm going to bring it into the inner corner
8:24and i'm going to stop it where my lashes stop growing if that makes sense and i'm
8:28going to pick up another morphy single eyeshadow this is in the shade magical
8:32magenta and i'm going to overlay it right on top of deep damn sinks I just
8:36felt like it was looking just a little too basic and typical under there and I
8:40wanted to really brighten it up and make it a little bit more fun because if
8:43we're gonna do it we're going to do it right like I want this look to stand out
8:46and be really colorful and different
8:48I'm going to pick up just a little bit more of that make a geek morocco and use
8:50it to blend out that lower lash line
8:52this will also help tie the entire look together to bring some of that warm
8:56orange on the lower lash as well now i'm going to go in with mac nylon my
9:00favorite brow highlight in our corner highlight of all time
9:05this has been a ride or die product of mine legit since what 2,000 oh my god
9:092005 it's been a while
9:11I'm going to fill in my brows using the anastacio brow definer today is full of
9:16my favorites guys I just cause my favorite favorite product video because
9:19this is my favorite brow product ever like I don't think you understand
9:24everybody in my life has this definer now because I'm like wait a second
9:28you're still using the Browse i'll come on girl what are you living in a lot
9:31like this is the most amazing brow pencil of all time there's nothing like
9:36it i'm just ridiculously dedicated so let's just move past that we are going
9:40to be doing a little contouring and i'm going to be using a benefit hoola
9:43bronzer an oldie but a goodie
9:45I want to do an update a contour video soon because I just been using so many
9:48different brushes recently and we have been doing it I've been making it much
9:52more of an intense angle as far as from the top of the ear to the corner of the
9:56lips and then as always I am blending out the forehead area just around the
10:01hairline and making sure I don't get any product in the center of the forehead or
10:04center of the face because it will defeat the contouring purpose
10:07all right now mom's gonna bake do you see how much power I'm you think it
10:11looks like it's snowing in here do you see hope
10:14i'm using the RCM a no color powder to do a little bit of baking while i apply
10:19my blush and i'm using one of the new Becca
10:22blushes in the shade Tiger Lily they are very high pigmented they are very
10:26shimmery very frosty they're like similar to their highlight formula but
10:30for a blush so i use this coral shade to kind of tie the eyes and the cheeks
10:34together and then on top of it
10:36not necessary but I just felt like a little bit of pink - I picked up a
10:39little bit of mac kini pedal and i'm going to just put a little bit of that
10:43right over top so I feel like it was a little to call on my cheeks and I was
10:46like
10:47again not necessary I'm just extra and when you have a big makeup collection
10:52you want to use a lot you know what I'm saying so you can totally Capac blushes
10:55on do more than one but it is not necessary to all you guys going to go
10:59ahead and wipe away all that power that I put down there but then I was like
11:02wait a second
11:03I like the way this area looks i'm going to put just a little bit more and I'll
11:06dust it off in like a minute
11:07I'm going to grab some of the becca shimmering skin Perfector in the shade
11:11opal on a more feet 501 brush and I'm going to just highlight the tops of my
11:15cheekbones i still love opal so much it's like a cool tone highlight having a
11:19little bit of gray in it but it's just so beautiful it really stands out in a
11:23crowd
11:24I just love like the silver tones and I think it's really pretty I'm going to
11:28coat my lower lashes with some mascara I'm using the cabinet qua mascara i love
11:32this one it's my mom's favorite mascara and i've been using it a lot recently
11:35again and I i forgot how much i love it as well
11:38for lips i'm going to use color pop BFF lippie Stix it's like a really pretty
11:43orgy coralie kind of pale terracotta has a longer description of my life and then
11:49for gloss i'm going to go on with the Kylie cosmetics lip gloss in the shade
11:53so cute
11:54which is the Palace of all her shades I personally and not the biggest fan of
11:58these glasses I don't hate them but I'm not crazy about them you know
12:01you know I'm saying ok now i'm saying but I really like this with combination
12:04i think it looks super super pretty you know me I love a good nude and then just
12:08because I want to do a little something extra
12:10I'm going to take a little bit of brown shadow and just put it on my lower lip
12:13area just to give a natural contour to make my lips look a little bit fuller
12:17and powder and then use a little bit of clear brow gel so that these babies stay
12:21in place and that completes the look
12:23I hope you guys enjoyed thanks for watching love you see you soon
0:16hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial for you

0:24getting ready and I have to leave my house right now like I finished right on
0:28time so yeah I am sick i woke up this morning with eight terrible sore throat
0:34hurts so bad and probably go to the doctor because it's just not going i'm
0:37starting to think i'm getting a fever 2 which is just beyond typical because i
0:41am flying this week on
0:43i am going to New York City for a half business half vacation
0:47I will be there for four days i'm leaving on thursday return on monday so
0:49it's like of course I'm getting sick right now right

0:55I'm leaving my house soon as i'm done with this to go spend the afternoon with
0:59my family for easter so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this makeup tutorial it's
1:03very spring appropriate very fresh
1:06I absolutely love this look I'm wearing it constantly constantly recently
1:09this is the same look that was wearing in my favorites video that i just did
1:12and so many of you were asking what I was wearing if I could do a tutorial so
1:16here it is
1:17I hope that you guys enjoy thanks so much for watching i love you guys and
1:19I'll see you soon bye
1:21hello my loves the first thing we're going to do today is prime our face
1:24i am using the Makeup Forever radiant primer I'm going to massage this on my
1:28face with clean hands you know the drill you know how to prime your skin moving
1:31on
1:31i'm going to use the smashbox primer water only because i was so dry from
1:35being sick but two primers not necessary let's get real
1:38I'm going to also go in with the cabin a quan liquid highlighter I talked about
1:41this in my most recent favorites video this highlighter is my favorite going to
1:45massage that all over my bare skin
1:47just to give a really beautiful radiant glow as the base then i'm going to go in
1:51with your new dare foundation and I'm going to be applying that with what do
1:54you know the Sigma f80 kabuki brush as always i'm currently using the shade 030
1:59in this foundation and actually is a pinch too light for me but that's okay
2:03i'm going to go with bronzer and i'm going to warm up the skin and add some
2:06color
2:06I would prefer my foundation to be a little bit too light over too dark
2:10any day of the week now I'm going to be applying my under eye concealer and i'm
2:14using the Urban Decay Naked weightless full-coverage concealer
2:18I think I just nailed it i'm going to apply a little bit of on the under eye
2:21area and then also on the lid as well and I'm going to blend all that out with
2:24a damp Beauty Blender a tiny bit of this product goes a very
2:28long way so as you see i do not have to over use it and this is my favorite way
2:32to prime my eyes is to just use concealer and then go over top of it
2:36with a powder so i am using the anastacio banana powder to set this
2:40entire area that's my favorite way to Prime and i am using the morphe m510
2:45brush for this i really like it because it's kind of tapered and precise and i
2:48really like it for that area
2:50now i'm going to go in with the Chanel cream bronzer I should have done this
2:53before i set my under eye area i never recommend using any creams after powders
2:58but I wasn't feeling well so I wasn't really with it that day so I forgot
3:02but if you're doing this on your own do the cream first and then set the under
3:05eye area so i am using the Sigma f80 to which is an angled kabuki brush to apply
3:10this all over the cheekbones the forehead the temples the chin I'm just
3:14kind of bronzing not contouring
3:16now i'm going in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow and i'm using a sigma
3:21e40 brush to blend this back and forth and windshield wiper motions in my
3:24crease like i said before peach smoothie is my absolute favorite number one eye
3:27shadow of all time I basically can't do any makeup look without it it's just
3:31perfect for a nice transition shade
3:34now i'm grabbing makeup geek cupcake on that exact same brush I'm going to dust
3:38this right i mean that color back and forth and windshield wiper motions from
3:41inner corner to outer corner and then i will blend it upward as that product
3:46kind of disappears from my brush
3:47i will start going up like you see right now just to make sure that everything is
3:50blended together and we have no harsh lines
3:52now i'm going to go in with makeup geek latte this is kind of a reddish medium
3:57brown color and using a more precise brush this is the e25 from sigma i'm
4:01going to put that lower in my crease area so as you can see i am no longer
4:04kind of blending upward like I do with the other colors
4:07I'm kind of blending onward onto the eyelid if that makes sense as you can
4:11see right here
4:12then I'll go back with the sigma e40 and blend everything out once again with
4:15absolutely no additional product on that brush
4:18now i'm taking make a get chickity this is an oldie but a goodie has been one of
4:21my favorites forever
4:22it was just a touch of that i'm going to put it in that upper crease as well a
4:26lot of people are fearful of this color because it's orange and it can look
4:28crazy but if you use just a touch of it adds such a beautiful glow
4:32now i'm going in with makeup geek foiled eyeshadow and this is in the spotlight
4:36this is one of my absolute favorite shadows ever it is so beautiful it is
4:40such a gorge
4:41is beaming highlight shade for the lid i am using a mac 242 brush which is just a
4:46flat shader brush to apply that all over the lid
4:48you can use your finger for this product that works really well what's great
4:51about these is you get no fallout which is like my favorite part
4:55so once i put that generously all over the lid i will go back with the Sigma
4:58e25 and just kind of go over the edges that way there's not a distinct harsh
5:02line to where the shadow starts then i'm going to fill in my eyebrows i'm using
5:06anastacio browse in the shade
5:07nope i'm going to skip through this really quickly though because it's not
5:10so fun to watch
5:11in my opinion now i'm going in with mac and bark I love embark this is one of my
5:15colors that I just have to have from Mac it is a go-to color for me it's a super
5:20dark rich kind of purply brown and using an e 15 from sigma i'm going to just
5:25press that really tightly on my lower lashline not too generously because i
5:29don't want to be too dark and smoky then taking any pencil brush and a little bit
5:33of that same latte color that I used on my upper lid
5:36i'm going to just blend that out making the goofiest face of all time
5:39I'm going to go in with mango tango this is another shade from makeup geek
5:44such a pretty kind of orangie pink I love this color and I'm just gonna put a
5:48little dab of it on that lower lash line as well just to give some more dimension
5:52now i'm going in with a creamy ivory eyeliner and I'm going to line my
5:56waterline to really open up my eyes and make them look very fresh and springy i
6:00will list the one that I use in the description bar down below
6:03now i'm applying mascara so I am prepping my eyes for lashes
6:08we're going to be going on with my absolute favorite which are whisper
6:11sweet nothings by the lore lashes I love these because they look beautiful with
6:14or without eyeliner
6:16they're not too over the top of my face into dramatic but yet they're still
6:19super girly and they make a statement
6:21now i'm going to go in with makeup geek blush man it's a makeup geek day I'm
6:25going to be mixing a rendezvous and spellbound to make a really kind of
6:29purply pastel pinky cheek i have been loving loving this color of cheek
6:33recently for spring it's just so girly and dainty and super feminine
6:37now i'm going to be doing something that is so unnecessary and i'm going to be
6:41using it to separate highlighters these are both by becca and we are going in
6:44with opal and moonstone and i'm mixing those together just because i own them
6:48both and they are absolutely gorgeous when combined so i am using
6:51PM 501 brush to place this all over the tops of my cheekbones
6:55I keep the bow a dot on my chin and i'm also going to use the shades to
6:59highlight the brow bone as well i am again using the mac 242 brush to
7:03highlight the brow
7:04now i'm going to go and of course with mascara this is Mack nigga blacklash
7:08this is my favorite lower lash mascara I know it seems high maintenance to have a
7:11favorite lower lash mascara but I do
7:13now i'm going to go in with colour-pop lippie sick in the shade a westie a
7:17beautiful baby pink
7:18I'm going to top that off with a nars gloss in the shade glow pink which is

1:28enjoy this spring a huge trend is copper eyes oranges yellows coppers warm ground
1:35which I love because you usually think of autumn and fall for that type of
1:39trying but this year's spring you guys know
1:41that is like literally right up my alley I am so super excited so I thought I'll
1:46go ahead and shows with you it's a very fresh based super easy not even wearing
1:50eyeliner today which is crazy for me right so i hope you guys enjoyed this
1:53video i hope that you do it yourself a call if you do don't forget to tag me in
1:57any pictures and as always all the information every single detail every
2:01single question everything product that he mentioned in this video is going to
2:04be in the description bar below so many guys so much else sees it but we are
2:10going to start off today with the skin so first I'm going to do is primarily
2:13using do our globe maximizer like boosting primer and we are going to
2:17press this into the skin it will make such a difference if you press your
2:20primer into your skin as opposed to just rubbing it across your pores
2:24then we are going to go in with NARS sheer glow foundation and marc jacobs
2:28mixing these two together just gives me a really nice natural luminous finish
2:33I just that's just me I like mixing my foundations and i am using a sigma a
2:39brush to apply the foundation as always
2:42and then I'm going to go in with tarte amazonian clay concealer which I don't
2:46think I've ever even use on camera before but I actually would like to
2:48finish of this and i'm using it just too lightly highlight some areas of my
2:52phases where needed so around the lips
2:55Cupid's bow chin nostrils where you just get more morally red and as you can see
3:00this is not a very intense highlight it's nice and mild which I really like
3:04for a look like this since we really do want the skin to look nice and fresh and
3:08youthful but we don't want it to be like BAM highlighter or BAM contour your face
3:12so a little trick is just using your concealer for the face and I do prefer
3:16this concealer on the face as opposed to under the eyes
3:19I find that increases a little bit so under the eye i am going to use mac pro
3:23longwear concealer
3:25this one isn't she NW 20 which is a pinky beige undertone and as you can see
3:29it looks like i'm putting a lot on but i am actually blending it out and my
3:34finger will pick up a lot of the excess and then this is the f-86 brush by Sigma
3:39and the reason i love this brush so much is because it picks up so much excess
3:43concealer
3:43so you really don't get that buildup of chunky concealer that crease is
3:47underneath your eye i just love this brush because of that
3:50i'm also sweeping across my eyelid to prime for my eye shadow
3:54then I'm going to go in with my Bobby Brown Foundation stick to contour i will
3:58put my contouring video down below that's all about cream highlighter so
4:02you can see exactly what i'm doing and how I'm doing it but I am just using an
4:07angled brush again by Sigma absolutely love this brush for contouring as you
4:11can see it just blends out
4:13so naturally so beautifully I do pick up the product on the brush first as
4:18opposed to drawing on my face
4:20where the contour can be a little too strong and intense
4:24this will make it look much more buff out and natural just like you've been
4:27kissed by the Sun then i'm going to go in with Smashbox suntan matte bronzer
4:32with the NARS eat a brush and just hit that on that high point of my cheekbone
4:37and just dust it out I'm not going to really take this or drag all around the
4:41face just to bring more depth to certain areas and then using a Marc Jacobs
4:47foundation brush don't ask i'm obsessed with it i don't know why i bought it and
4:50now i'm just i'm in love this brush for buffing up my bronzer
4:53then i am using the brow bar to go this is by lightning lightning
4:57I have fallen in love with this product recently so i'm just going to use the
5:01lighter shade to fill in the inner part of my brow and the darker brown to fill
5:05in the outer part i am using anastacio brush
5:08I'm not sure which one it is but i will list it down below and then using the
5:12anastacio contour kit i am going to go in with this banana color right there in
5:17the center and mix it with mac emphasized as always
5:22and then just lightly dust that around the eye area
5:25i am using a sigma tapered highlighting brush to do so and as you can see i am
5:29just padding padding padding
5:31you don't want to go too generous with this highlight because again you don't
5:34want the skin to be really intense today you want to keep it nice not natural not
5:40au is not the word because this definitely isn't natural
5:43but you understand we don't want anything to be too intense and in your
5:46face so make sure using a light hand with all the products that you are
5:49applying so just using these highlighting powders just
5:52set everything that I've done then i'm going to go in with amber lights and
5:56copper ring both by math cosmetics
5:59these are the two shadows that i have been wearing for nine years of my life
6:02mixing them together is just absolutely beautiful
6:06so I am using a sigma e25 brush just about this all over my lid which is just
6:10a white goat hair blending black brush and this is the only brush that you will
6:14need for this look on the top of the eyelid and because these shadows are so
6:19creamy and smooth you don't even need another brush or another color to buff
6:24it out where typically in your transition shade and this look this is
6:28all you need
6:29with putting no additional products on that brush just buff upward and it will
6:33just naturally blend itself out just make sure you continuously go and
6:37windshield wiper motions
6:39then with any pencil brush this is an old-school pencil brush i just use it
6:42all the time is like my tried-and-true die don't even remember what brand is
6:45from it might be sedona lace just put that on earth your eyes from inner to
6:50outer corner buffing it back and forth again make sure you get even amount of
6:54product of the gold and the copper if anything like to pick up a little bit
6:58additional gold then with no additional products and a blending brush
7:02I just go back and forth just to buff that out even more and give a really
7:06blown out feel then i'm using Giorgio Armani is to kill mascara which oh my
7:11gosh I'm falling in love with this is a sample size and I do not want to spend
7:15that kind of money on mascara i'm pretty sure i'm going to have to then i'm using
7:18Mac spring machine
7:20blush which is absolutely gorgeous it's the perfect peach with a little bit of
7:25pink and i'm going to dust that on the apples of my cheeks working backward
7:29blending it into that bronzer toward the temple area making big buffing circular
7:34motions to again adds that sunkissed glow look
7:38then I go in with the same brush that I used to highlight and I just kind of go
7:41over that blush area and that's what gives you the really blown out airbrush
7:45look on the cheeks then i'm using the Bekaa highlighter in the shade opal
7:49which I am falling in love with this is such a great dupe for mac whisper of
7:54guilt which is only comes out like once a year in a collection and everybody
7:58loves it and it's such a beautiful highlighter but this one is so close
8:02in comparison I absolutely love it so using a sigma taper how to brush again
8:06I'm going to touch on the high points of my base
8:08moving on and I'm just going to cut my bottom lashes and any mascara you want
8:13just to finish off that I look now it is totally optional but i'm just going to
8:17pop on a pair of false lashes with look like this false lashes can be really
8:21really pretty and you don't need any eyeliner as long as you get close enough
8:24to your lash line
8:26these are escudo lashes I'm not sure which style i will list that in the
8:29description bar with a link to it and then using the Maybelline gel liner this
8:33is totally optional i just wanted to show you an easy tip just to push it up
8:37on that top waterline
8:39this will make your lashes look thicker fuller and blend your natural ones with
8:43your fake ones it's also a great tip just to make your lashes look fuller you
8:46know if you're not wearing falsies then using the Tarte Amazonian butter
8:50lipstick and golden pink
8:52I'm going to also mix that with the YSL rouge alup number 15
8:56using patting motions to get my favorite lip color for spring
9:00absolutely love then setting everything with Urban Decay eyeshadow makeup
9:04setting spray i'm going to take a shower in it just as everything is set and then
9:08you're all done so i hope you enjoy this fresh-faced spring tutorial and love you
9:13guys and I'll see you soon
0:00hey guys so today I'm going to be doing it really easy everyday fresh face
0:05makeup look
0:06this is truly an everyday makeup look this is as little as it gets for me if I
0:10am NOT doing this and I'm not doing anything
0:13i typically only wear make up about three or four days a week me sometimes
0:18like one or two days a week but three to four days a week and this is a look
0:21I wear one like I have to get up early and i'm going to be running errands all
0:24day long
0:24I don't want to be looking like a caveman but at the same time I want to
0:27give a little something
0:29so this is like my happy medium where I'm not all dolled up and glamorous
0:32oh yeah i'm not looking like I dead so this is super easy
0:37basic gonna work for everybody of course i have a couple versions of like my
0:41everyday makeup look
0:43this is the most easy basic shortest one that I have you have an upgraded version
0:47of this that's a few more additional products a little bit more glamorous
0:51I of course will be happy to do that for you if you want to see that look as well
0:54but I thought we would start with the basics so i hope you enjoyed this makeup
0:58tutorial and i will see you guys soon
1:04good morning everybody
1:07well hello honey boo go nice to see you shirtless
1:10ok moving on the first thing we're going to do is put on our foundation I'm using
1:14bucks and show some skin weightless foundation
1:16i'm going to be using my very own brush line today making your tips I'm going to
1:22just warm this up and emulsified on the tips of my fingers
1:24make sure your hands are freshly clean and then i'm going to just rub this on
1:28my face I know you're probably thinking oh what the hell just froze over where
1:32is your Sigma f80 but when you're in a rush and if your brushes are dirty
1:36mhm my situation sometimes you just gotta use your fingertips God made him
1:41for a reason
1:42so make sure you Bluff in the foundation it's not gonna look as pretty as a brush
1:45but hey we can manage that i'm using maybelline fit me concealer
1:49this is a drugstore concealer obviously since its by Maybelline
1:52it is a nice sheer concealer but you can get a medium coverage out of it because
1:56it is buildable using my middle finger i'm going to just blend this in and then
2:01i'm also going to make sure that I get it on my eyelid I always always do this
2:04because you have a lot of veins in your eyelid and if you're tired you're
2:07definitely get redness there and it's gonna show all your dirty secrets so
2:11cover up your eyelid area it will smooth everything out make you look a lot more
2:15fresh I tap this nav
2:17as always I take it back towards my temple make sure when you're finishing
2:21off you go in an inward motion from outer corner in your corner
2:24it will help prevent creasing then using bare minerals
2:27well rested powder this powder is formulated to make you look well-rested
2:31has a brightening effect in it but it is not a highlighter so don't get it
2:35confused this is just going to set your concealer and give a nice well rested
2:40effect
2:41it's really nice for everyday look because it looks nice and natural and
2:45there's no shimmer or highlight happening it whatsoever
2:49I always set my eye area just so that that doesn't move around whatsoever
2:53now i'm going to go in with benefit give me brow gimme brow
2:56sorry give me about the tiniest little itty-bitty brush of life
3:00I'm gonna go in and just brush through my natural brow hair
3:03I love gimme brow because it has fibers and it adheres to your natural brow hair
3:08so not only do they still and it makes it look fuller instantly
3:12it is such a genius product and because the brush is so tiny it grabs on to
3:16every single little baby hair
3:18it is so so fast so double grass and i'm going to go in with makeup geek creme
3:24brulee eyeshadow
3:25you can use any eyeshadow you want or bronzer whatever you prefer this is just
3:29my go-to eyeshadow that looks nice my skin tone and I can just put it in my
3:33crease any day of the week and I'm never going to be disappointed by it we all
3:36have those go to colors and this one is mine
3:39so using an e 40 brush by Sigma this is definitely my go-to i brush when it
3:43comes to blending and buffing things out so i'm just going from inner corner to
3:47outer corner and it's just going to contour our eyes so we don't look like
3:50we're sleeping
3:51I'm going to curl my lashes any lash curler will be just fine as long as you
3:55like it and I get a couple of pulses squeeze squeeze squeeze
3:58and I'm good to go i'm gonna go in with l'oreal voluminous original mascara in
4:03the shade black and make sure that when you're applying your mascara you really
4:06wiggle especially at the root of your lashes
4:09it's a little trick that we all use just like you tease your hair for fullness
4:13you want to tease your lashes for fullness as well so really go back and
4:16forth and wiggle at the root of those lashes and then drag it down straight
4:20work if that makes sense then we're going to go in with mac care blend
4:25pressed powder in the shade dark this is my go-to bronzing powder right now and
4:29i'm using a big fat fluffy brush and I'm going to just bronze in the outer
4:33portion of my cheeks as you can see i shake off a lot of the excess
4:37this will help / bronzing any streaking or muddiness that could happen on the
4:41face so I'm just going to bring the cheek area and then around the forehead
4:45just to even it out don't neglect your forehead when bronzing because it can
4:49look a little weird
4:50I'm going with matt spring sheet i always choose a blush
4:53it has a really nice shimmer in it because on days like today I'm not going
4:56to be doing the whole highlighting and contouring so using a brush like this
5:00already has some shimmer in it will help to highlight and a more subtle way and
5:05not just like BAM streaks of highlight on the cheeks then i go over with that
5:09well rested
5:10again whatever is left on that brush and this is just a trick to buff things out
5:14so you don't have any harshness and it looks airbrushed on the cheeks
5:18now we're going to go in with mac sure we're going to just dad this underneath
5:22that brow
5:23this is my favorite most universal beautiful highlight shade
5:26I've loved it for
5:27years and i truly pretty much use it on everyone and going to dab and inner
5:31corner as well
5:32putting a light shimmer in the inner corner and brow will really help in
5:36making you look more awake for someone who's more mature i highly recommend
5:39mylar my mac cosmetics
5:41it doesn't have as much shimmer but it's beautiful I'm going to go in with stigma
5:44lip gloss in the shade tent
5:46this is my favorite lip gloss right now for days like today because it's pretty
5:49much the exact same color of my lips but just nice and glossy it's got that
5:53perfect little rose effect to it going to put that on and then we are all done
5:58can we get any easier I think not I love you guys thank you for watching and I'll

2:08will be available until wednesday April thirtieth which is one week from today
2:12unless it sells out beforehand
2:15I will list all of the direct links along with the discount code for you
2:18guys in my description bar below this video if any of you are interested
2:22ok let's get into the tutorial first thing I'm going to do as always is prime
2:27my eyes I'm using mac pro longwear concealer in the shade and w 20
2:32this is a little bit lighter than my natural skin tone which will really help
2:35to get a nice blank highlighted canvas as the background and make your shadow
2:38show up a little bit more intensely
2:40not to mention such a smooth surface to blend and work with your shadows on then
2:45going in with good old scotch tape
2:47we're going to take off a piece and put on the back of our hand just to get off
2:51that intense stickiness so it doesn't pull out your eye area
2:54now we're going to match up kind of winged eyeliner from the angle of your
2:57ID going toward the tail of your brow
3:00I did the same method in my smoky Cateye tutorial and it works like a charm
3:04then going with makeup geek peach smoothie and creme brulee
3:08we are going to take an e-40 brush and just dust this in our crease
3:11we're going to start in the outer corner because we prefer to have the darkest
3:15color in the outer corner and wherever you first lay your brush on the skin is
3:18where you're going to have the most pigments but we are going to blend this
3:21all the way into the inner corner and add that pigment is leaving the brush
3:25start going upward and that will help blend it out then going in with makeup
3:29geek trap
3:30we are going to take this color which is a mid-tone brown it's not as warm as the
3:34others which really helps give more dimension to the look and we are using a
3:38sigma e25 starting again and that outer crease you can go right over that tape
3:42which is what makes this look so easy just that tape makes it impossible to be
3:47too messy
3:48so just go right on that tape blind to all the way from inner and outer corner
3:51and make sure you blend it out with a clean brush another shadow by makeup
3:55geek is cocoa bear
3:56we're going to take this on the same a 25 x sigma and put this predominantly in
4:01that outer corner
4:02I know this seems like a lot of shadows but that's because it's a lot of shadows
4:05and this is going to give you the best result then going in with make a beak
4:09corrupt any black shadow will do make it because the blood
4:12shadow I've ever personally worked with before and this is a makeup geek brush
4:17I don't know the name or number of it i will sit down below in my description
4:20bar of course which is going right over top of that tape
4:23we're going to blend it in work the great thing about this is you do not
4:27have to worry about blending two perfectly because the next step will
4:30really take care of that for us
4:32so just go over with any brush you can have a little cocoa bear left on it or
4:36can be blank
4:37whatever and I just go over that black area just so that you don't have any
4:41harsh lines right in there but don't worry about blending it on your lid
4:44we're going with Too Faced shadow insurance glitter glue
4:47huh one of the best products in the world when working with intense pigments
4:51or glitters at all
4:53we're going to put this all over the lid as you can see i use my finger then
4:56we're going to go in with makeup geek
4:57it's making me kind of gay people utopia this is such an amazing pigment but
5:02listen to me when I say use a glitter glue if you don't use a glitter glue it
5:07can be a hot mess
5:08packing this all over our lid we are using a mac 242 brush because when i
5:12find working with messy intense pigments like this you're going to have the best
5:16outcome when you use the thinnest brush possible that brush is gonna take too
5:20much of it and slaughter on your face
5:22so thin brush like this we'll pack it on as you can see I'm patting i am not
5:26sweeping
5:27so you want to pat pat pat pat pat this and you want to blend and sweep your
5:32brushes when you're blending your other shadows but with this pigment just
5:35strictly Pat we did the eyes first because otherwise this will be all over
5:40our foundation
5:42so just peeling off that tape you can see shows am baby you have got an
5:46intense cat eye when you first pull it off it always looks kind of weird like
5:50okay that's a really really harsh line but you will see how we are going to
5:53blend that out
5:54you can see up close it's intense you could just pop on a pair of false lashes
5:59like this and you'll be good to go just mascara your natural lashes and you can
6:02see super pretty
6:04i'm going to show you how to do eyeliner if you're interested because it is so
6:07easy
6:08so you're going to follow that natural line at the scotch tape made taking any
6:12black liner i am using Maybelline blackest black
6:17and i'm just going to follow that exact edge and then just sculpt out my
6:21eyeliner as always
6:22whenever you are doing eyeliner over any sort of glitter sparkle chunky pigment
6:28anything along that line
6:29just be patient you're gonna have to go over a few times back and forth to make
6:33sure that it is black
6:34if you're a perfectionist like me you have to go over a lot of times because i
6:37hate glitter being on my black liner and then we're going to pop on a pair of
6:42false lashes by the Brandis quito i am not positive of the name of these so i
6:46will sit in my description bar right below this video
6:49they are very dramatic and very prominent proprietary when I got them in
6:53the mail I looked at them and I was it from
6:55oh sorry how to bust out and dance for two seconds moving on make up for ever
6:58micro perfecting primer is where i'm going to be using it's important to
7:02Prime and times where you really want to make up to
7:05last last last in this primer i do see a difference i really been enjoying it so
7:09make sure you press it into the skin has a nice yellow tent in a few different
7:13colors depending what you need
7:15now i'm going in with NARS sheer glow foundation I'm using the shade
7:19punjab and using an f-86 up kabuki brush
7:23one of these days I'm going to switch it up on you guys use a different
7:25foundation brush and you're going to be like hell froze over what's happening
7:28for right now I'm going to be using the f80 as always impressing into the skin i
7:33always start in a pressing motion and whatever is left over you can kind of
7:36move around in a sweeping motion but pressing into the skin will help it
7:39lasts the longest make sure you blend it down the jawline
7:42so you have a line of demarcation then i'm going to fill in my brows
7:46I'll put my brow video down below in the description bar i usually put all my
7:49basic videos down there in case you're curious i'm using the Anasazi or browse
7:54in the shade soft brown and then caramel for the tail
7:58so by being we're going to finish that do you whatever you want to do with your
8:01brows have fun then we're going to go in with the same concealer that we put on
8:06our eyes in the beginning
8:07mac pro longwear and w20 as you can see it's lighter than the rest of my
8:11foundation which we are going for because i want that highlighted
8:14look I'm blending it out with the sigma f 86 brush which is my holy grail
8:19foundation
8:20I'm sorry concealer brush I absolutely love this brush evening out our
8:25highlight under our eyes we are going to highlight other areas of our face
8:29using the Mac prep and prime highlighter and shade light boost which is the green
8:32yellow shade
8:33there is also one that is a pinky shade and a peach i'm going to just put this
8:37around the mouth area and then in between the eyebrows
8:41this will help so that you don't have that stark white under eye area and the
8:44rest of your face just looks kind of strange you want to balance it all out
8:48by doing this
8:49it's very quick and very easy i know it looks intense promise you
8:52then i'm going to go ahead and set that under eye concealer using macpro
8:58highlighting powder in the shape emphasize this is a stark white powder
9:02so make sure that you are not going overboard with it just a light tapping
9:06is all you need
9:07again I tap this and press this into the skin other than a sweeping motion it
9:11will help to truly absorb that powder and not crease throughout the day as
9:15opposed to when you just sweep it across the face sometimes it can settle into
9:18the fine lines even more then we're gonna go on with Smashbox suntan matte
9:24bronzer and we're going to contour using our nars eat a brush
9:28i highly recommend contouring on prom as opposed to bronzing because this will
9:33definitely show up and pictures it'll make you look nice and mature and really
9:37give you that Kim K look that everyone is going for
9:40I of course will put my contour video down below I am sculpting out my
9:44cheekbones and around the temples of my forehead and you can touch a little bit
9:47on the jaw line and blend it all out then going in with mac shroom
9:52we are going to put this right underneath our eyebrows on that brow
9:56bone and a little tip if you have issues blending your eyeshadow up on top by the
10:00brows just kind of bring this brush down and blend it into that shadow that you
10:05already have on the eye area and it will help bring it all together and we're
10:09going to put a dabble of cocoa bear which was that warm brown and our outer
10:13corner on the lower lash then going in with whatever you want creme brulee
10:17frappe anything you have just take any pencil brush and just blend back and
10:22forth back and forth
10:24this is really going to open up your eyes so i recommend you really blend
10:27don't be scared blend back and forth and really buff out this under eye area and
10:32make them look much bigger especially and photos
10:35then i'm going to use makeup geek I don't know the name of this liner for
10:40the first time in my life I'm at a loss for words
10:42I cannot remember the name of the signer it's a black gel liner i listed down
10:45below
10:46I love this for the water line because it does not move and it does not burn
10:49and those are the only two things i'm asking for life when it comes to liners
10:52then I'm going to go in with back a wild honey blush
10:56saddest day ever i'm going to just blend this all of the cheek area this is a
11:02bronzy color with a little bit of terracotta in it's so gorgeous it
11:07doesn't have a super shimmer which I don't want a really intense shimmer
11:10I want my keeps to be a little bit more mad and then we're going to go in with a
11:14highlight this is opal by becca one of my all-time favorite highlights ever in
11:20a sigma taper highlighting brush just to highlight those cheekbones this again
11:24will look absolutely beautiful and pictures you wont be over shimmery over
11:27Dewey it will be the perfect amount and photos
11:30just a little top of it on the chin Cupid's bow and nose and you're done
11:36i'm going to remove the foundation i have going on my lips and you can see
11:39how naturally pigmented my lips are
11:41it's a little intense and it's difficult for me to get new lips because of how
11:45pigmented my naturally are so we're going to go in with mac creme brulee
11:50this is a cream machine i believe so it's nice and creamy and on the sheer
11:54side and i'm going to top it off with color your smile lighted lip gloss in
11:58the shade
11:59nude if you guys have not heard of these glasses yet you need to jump on the
12:02bandwagon
12:03they're amazing and they have a mirror on the side of the lip gloss tube and
12:06they light up so you can do your lip gloss in the dark in public it is
12:10definitely a prom and all night out essential
12:12I love mine then i'm going to set the masterpiece with Urban Decay chill
12:17makeup setting spray and take a quick bath in this and we are all done
12:20i love you guys so much thank you for watching happy prom and i'll see you
12:24soon
0:13hey guys today I'm going to be doing my first holiday look I am super excited to
0:23finally be doing this oh my gosh
0:25so the story behind this yes there's a story as always so I uploaded my blog -
0:30it's a couple of days ago and if you guys watch that you can see that i have
0:33my friends in town and I like a little vacation and I got sick to top it off
0:37and it's like we're not running Cygnus
0:38but anyways because of that I haven't got around to doing quality looks and I
0:42have all these ideas and everything is so last night I was setting up my lights
0:46and everything to film this morning and I wanted to do something like really
0:49crazy colorful and glittery and the holidays and then I was like you know
0:54what
0:55yes those things might be fun but we're already in the middle of the month and I
0:58thought I want to do something
1:00it's more neutral and wearable for you guys that are actually watching this
1:03video because even though it can be fun to watch something like glittering over
1:06the top but like why i like you know like not actually useful for the average
1:12woman and we're already in mid-december so it's like I figured let's just do
1:16something that like you guys can actually take tips from you guys can
1:20actually use for yourself at home you're saying so I i love this look it's like a
1:25very soft cut crease
1:26we have some glitter in there but it's not too much not overboard
1:30I just think that this is very subtle but at the same time
1:34screams the holidays you compare this I with any lip color that you want right
1:38now i'm wearing occ lip tar in the shade
1:40harlot Marlo harlot is what i am wearing
1:45so yeah oh yeah and he's ready to thank you so much for watching i love you guys
1:49so much i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and i'll see you soon
1:52but so I'm going to be starting off priming my eyes because we are going to
1:57start with our eyes today since we are using glitter I don't start my
2:00foundation because the glitter can fall down and kind of ruin the foundation so
2:04study with eyes i'm going in with mac kid eyeshadow
2:08this is a great transition color if you're familiar with soft brown it's
2:12kind of similar just a little bit cooler and lighter in tone which i absolutely
2:15love
2:17so using an e 40 brush from sigma i'm going to concentrate this on the upper
2:20crease of my eye
2:22I'm trying to kind of avoid the lid just because we
2:25we're going to do a soft cut crease today now i'm going in with a morphy
2:28eyeshadow and this is number 62 this is a little bit darker than kid and it's
2:32very neutral in tone so it's not going to be too warm or too cool
2:36using a sigma e25 i'm going to just put that again in that upper crease area
2:41kind of trying to avoid the lid
2:43once we have that on i'm going to go in with another morphy shadow and this is
2:46number 15 which is much warmer in tone i'm going to take a makeup geek blending
2:51brush you can go in the same be 25 this was just laying there so I just used it
2:54for you no no really different reason
2:56but i'm going to again to the exact same thing with this and I'm going to just
2:59start buffing everything upward again just avoiding that lid board the fact
3:04that we are doing a soft cut crease then I go in with an e 40 from sigma always
3:09this is like the magic wand in my collection
3:11just to buff everything out and make sure that we have no harsh lines and
3:14then i'm going to go in with mac shroom
3:17this is very loved in my house as you can see i go through probably i would
3:21say one of these a year because I just absolutely love it
3:23it's gorgeous all over the lid it's gorgeous as a brow bone highlight as a
3:26chick highlight it works pretty much on all skin tones
3:29it's just a great color so using a 242 brush from Mac I'm going to just press
3:34this all over the lid and going to help it to carve helped carve out of that lid
3:39area even more so we have more of a defined cut crease as you can see i will
3:44push that up on the entire lid up into that crease area to kind of erase some
3:48of the brown fell down on our lid
3:51this will just help define it just a little bit more and then as always I
3:54will go back with a blending brush and just ever so slightly
3:57make sure that we have no harsh lines because even though i'm doing a slight
4:00cut crease I still don't want to be too harsh
4:03so now taking a makeup geek pencil brush and makeup geek corrupt eyeshadow which
4:08is a very black intense shadow
4:10i'm going to just ever so slightly press the shadow on my upper lash line only on
4:15the outer corner of my eye
4:17this will give kind of like a romantic soft smokey effect but I love doing this
4:23only on the outer corner and leaving the inner corner blank because I just think
4:26that it really gives you like that cat eye and it's just very romantic as
4:30opposed to lining everything which can be a little bit more dramatic and a
4:33little bit more harsh
4:34Plus this brush makes this step just like foolproof
4:37anyone can do it I'm going to go with a pencil brush and literally just above it
4:41back and forth with really no rhyme or reason just so that it's not harsh
4:44whatsoever because i do not want it to be too black or too intense at all i
4:48want to be nice and soft and subtle
4:51so now for the fun part i'm going to be going in with mac cosmetics loose
4:55glitter and this is in the shade reflects pearl
4:58this is a mac pro item mine is from an old wonder woman collection but you can
5:02still get it online on just the regular mac cosmetics website to add here that
5:06to the eyes i am using two faced shadow insurance and glitter glue
5:09I put it in the back of my hand and then I kind of pick it up with a 242 brush
5:13anything that's flat and I press that glitter all over the lid and then I
5:17immediately put my brush in the glitter and I start dabbing if you do this your
5:22glitter will not move it will not fall on your face
5:25it will not crease this glitter glue is everything
5:28there are many different brands that have glitter glue but i just love this
5:30one it's like my tried-and-true it literally is like super glue for glitter
5:35i absolutely love it i've never had an issue with it so i put it all over my
5:38lid and then immediately within 10 seconds
5:41I pack on that glitter well it's still tacky now i'm going to go in with
5:44flutter lashes in the style
5:46Kim oh my gosh i love these lashes
5:50they are so fun they're like have these lashes so they're not going to go on
5:54your entire lash line
5:55they're only gonna go on the outer corner but they are so cool I was not
5:59expecting to love them as much as I do but look at how awesome that is like
6:03it's just a little extra something so i didn't want to go overboard the lashes
6:07because i wanted the inner corner to be nice and subtle and kind of blank and I
6:11wanted the outer corner to have more like a romantic kind of flirty vibe so I
6:15love these lashes for that purpose
6:17I'm going to be priming my face and I'm using our glass of ale and I'm gonna rub
6:21that all over and then i'm going to go in with the what do you know the same
6:25foundation is always
6:26giorgio armani luminous silk i'm using shade 6.5 and no it does not match my
6:32face whatsoever but it does match my neck and that is what we want to color
6:36match it with I need to get my selfless tanner on though because this is not a
6:41good look for me
6:42so yeah I need to remind me to do that later thank you moving on i'm going to
6:46go ahead and conceal my under eye area
6:48i'm using mac pro longwear concealer which is
6:50try to intrude absolute favorite concealer ever ever ever ever for the
6:55under eye area
6:56I'm mixing shades nw20 and NW 25 just to get my perfect color i really wish that
7:01they would make like an NW 22.5 because hello
7:05I need up in here using a damp Beauty Blender I'm going to blend that
7:08concealer out towards the temple is just to kind of give a slight sculpted lifted
7:12look to the face
7:14i'm going to set my under eye concealer as always i'm using anastacio banana
7:18powder from her contour kit
7:19I also mix it with mac pro emphasize shaping powder i am using a tapered
7:24highlighting brush from sigma which is ideal for the under eye area and i'm
7:28going to use a mineralized skin finish from mac and shade medium plus and i'm
7:32just going to put powder on my nose because i don't like a shiny nose
7:36I'm totally out of focus here for my brows so i'm going to move right past
7:39that because i just did a video and i will link it down below
7:43so after my brows I am highlighting my brow bone using the same car that we use
7:47on the lid which is shroom by Mac then to finish off the eye area
7:52I'm going to take the same black shadow from makeup geek and i'm going to just
7:55put that only on the outer corner of my lower lash line and then buff it out
7:59with a pencil brush as you can see it took 2 seconds
8:03I don't really want it to be perfect on there i want to be a little messy just
8:06to kind of give that soft romantic feel
8:09and on the inner corner i'm going to highlight as well using any highlight
8:13that you want i think im using shroom here i might be using crystal avalanche
8:17because they're right next to each other my palate but whatever you want i'm
8:20putting a quick coat of mascara on my lower lashes
8:23i'm using a rimmel lash accelerator from the drugstore
8:27so that is our completed I look and now to finish this off we will move to the
8:30face
8:31i'm going to use a mac studio careful and pressed powder in the shade dark
8:34which is technically a face powder but like I've said many times before i love
8:39using face powders for sculpting the face because i think that they usually
8:42are the softest ones and most blendable since they are designed to be a full
8:46coverage foundation
8:47I typically like those the best for contour e so using a makeup geek blush
8:51brush I believe this is I'm going to just put this on the temples in a
8:54contour a little bit we're going to go in with a more fee and b5 and just buff
8:59all this out so that it looks more like bronze and not like LA
9:03in your face contour I'm going to go in with becca flower child
9:06I wanted some pinky cheeks and i am going to be using the morphe what is
9:12this this is the more feet
9:13mm no g8 the morphe GA as my blush brush i absolutely love this brush for blush
9:19it's like my favorite right now for highlight i'm going to go in with
9:22artists couture
9:24this is the diamond glow powder and i am going to be mixing the shade conceded
9:29and yeah as I give myself seriously want to say that I'm going to be mixing those
9:35two colors and highlighting my cheekbones
9:37I'm gonna be honest this looks way better in person the camera is picking
9:41it up very chunky which I am NOT happy about but in person these really are
9:45very beautiful
9:47to complete this look you can pair any lip color you want but i did choose to
9:51use occ lip tar in the shade harlot and i will put the lip liner that imac shit
9:56with in the description box down below so that completes this tutorial i hope
9:59you guys enjoy i love you so much
10:01happy holidays and i'll see you soon bye guys
0:13hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial and honestly I have no
0:21idea what i'm calling this yet I am so scatterbrained right now I just
0:24literally grab some eyeshadow sat down and just fill this as i was coming up
0:29with it in the mirror so typically i am much more thought-out and put together
0:32before I fill my tutorial for you but this was just like I was inspired to do
0:37this because twice yesterday i saw in a magazine article and on the TV show how
0:42orange eyeshadow is so I'm trying for summer but so many people are
0:46intimidated by the color and don't know how to wear it so I was like I got it
0:50because if you watch my channel and if you are new to my channel the first
0:53thing you should know about me is I am orange obsessed anything warm brown
0:57orange corals gold yellows
0:59I just I love itself about that I would do a tutorial for you guys showing you
1:05how all of you can get an orange eyeshadow look that is not overwhelming
1:08not gonna be scary and it's going to come with all I shades this look is
1:12really going to make light eyes such as mine blue green hazel eyes really bright
1:16and really stand out there very complimentary sorry I'm like talking so
1:20much with my hands
1:21way too enthused about this situation my personal favorite eye color for this
1:25look though is brown eyes
1:27anytime that I use the shadows on a brown eyed girl
1:30oh so beautiful it will just make the honey stand out in your brown eyes and
1:35just really shine through
1:37so this really will look good on all I colors and as you'll see the tutorial it
1:41is so easy to achieve
1:43so I'm going to stop rambling and one of you guys enjoy this video sorry for
1:45being a little over the place in a little wacky Jackie is always i love you
1:49guys so much thanks for watching and I'll see you later
1:51hey guys so the first thing I'm going to be doing today is applying lip balm i am
1:56using the sugar lip treatment it's always a good idea to moisturize your
1:59lips before you apply your makeup so they don't get dried out then i'm using
2:03an oldie but a goodie
2:04L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation I'm using my Sigma f80 flat top kabuki brush
2:09to press this into my skin
2:11this foundation is ideal for somebody who is dry to normal and skin type
2:15because it has such a beautiful dewy luminosity to it it does not have any
2:20glitter or any shimmer or Sparkle and it
2:23just gives a really dewy fresh face glow
2:26I absolutely love it it is from the drugstore but feels much more like a
2:29high-end luxurious foundation it is beautiful on the skin
2:33then we're going to go in with mac pro longwear concealer and i'm going to tap
2:37this starting an inner corner of my eye
2:39lightly dragging it down make sure you're very careful towards the temple
2:42and then going in with sigma f 86
2:45this is not technically a concealer brush but i use it as a concealer brush
2:49because since it has the synthetic fibers it really soaks up the excess
2:53concealer
2:54so if you're somebody who can accidentally be too heavy-handed on your
2:57concealer application
2:59this will really soak up the excess product so that you won't have creasing
3:02or cake under eye area then we are going to go in with mac pro soft focus which
3:08is the yellow shade and emphasize which is the white one and we're going to mix
3:12them together and just tap this underneath the eye area to set that
3:16concealer using a sigma tapered highlighter brush I use this brush for
3:20many different things and this is one of them
3:22i am currently out of my anastacio banana color powder so i am using the
3:26soft focus one instead which is absolutely ideal for anybody who is a
3:31little bit darker and skin tone of the meat but I'm making it work then I'm
3:34going to fill in my brows just like normal and i'm using anastacio browse
3:39now i am using oh yeah look at the difference in those brows baby i am
3:42using a different shade accidentally like i told you i'm a little over the
3:46place today
3:47accidentally using the wrong shade to fill in my brows so because of that they
3:51come out looking a little ashy today but we can see past that and just move right
3:55along and filling them in like normal though no intense like shaping or
3:59anything just a typical brow
4:01Phil situation then we're gonna move on to eye shadow i'm using makeup geek
4:05peach smoothie and a sigma e40 fluffy brush and I'm going to dust this from
4:09inner corner to outer corner
4:11as you can see i am a lightly building it up but I'm starting off with just a
4:14tiny amount of eyeshadow and just making it more intense as we go
4:19it is so important to start off with a light color like this
4:22higher up and the crease this will really make it so that your blending
4:26just comes out perfectly
4:27start with a light color first then move downward and darker shapes going on with
4:32makeup geek
4:33chickity and an e 35 brush any 35 brush is a more tapered brush it has less
4:38hairs and it is longer so it's going to blend a little bit more precisely and
4:43get deeply in that crease so I'm going all the way from inner corner to outer
4:47corner back and forth and windshield wiper motions them back with the e-40 to
4:52buff it out you can use more peach smoothie if you want you don't have to
4:55just make sure you blend blend blend and windshield wiper motions
4:58this is a part of the tutorial where accidentally didn't record the majority
5:02of applying eyeshadow
5:04so i'm going to explain to you exactly what i do i am using makeup geek
5:08glamorous eyeshadow as you can see right here in this clip it is a beautiful
5:12bronzy gold shade it is more of a rose gold with some copper tones in it is
5:17absolutely gorgeous
5:18we're putting that all over the lid from inner corner to outer corner then we're
5:22going to take makeup geek gold digger eyeshadow
5:25we're going to put that on top of the shade glamorous and the ball of our eyes
5:29so right in the center of that lid we're going to put gold digger or top just to
5:32get a pop so now you have that bronzy copper and gold going on on that lid
5:38then we're gonna mix
5:39tickety and cocoa bear and rub that all over the lower lash line and then last
5:43but not least we're going to highlight the inner corner and the brow with becca
5:47opal highlighter such an amazing highlighter look at that thing
5:52it's beaming it's amazing and then we are going to get back to reality
5:56okay we are now applying the lower lashes and whisper sweet nothings
6:01these are like my top three favorite lashes of life I just absolutely love
6:04them and i am using a different glue than normal this is a house of lashes
6:09I ran out of my duo glue this month and so i have been using this for a few
6:12weeks and so far i really really love it
6:15so no liner just lashes then I'm going to take that gold digger shade on any
6:21brush that you choose and I'm going to push on my lower waterline if you let me
6:26push the water line will flip out and you can get an easier application
6:29without causing wrinkles and tugging on that lower waterline
6:32it might seem weird that I'm using
6:34eyeshadow instead of eyeliner but for people who have sensitive eyes eyeshadow
6:38can actually work better because it doesn't hurt or burn your eyes at all as
6:41opposed to some liners and it really will stay for a long time and I was
6:46going to call my lower lashes with lashes with mascara black mascara and
6:50this should be your eye looks so far so very gold very warm not overboard in the
6:55orange right
6:56I think it's the perfect amount of orange then we're going to go in with
7:00math care blend press powder in the shade dark using the NARS eat a brush
7:05I'm going to lightly contour i do not want to do a heavy contouring but i do
7:09want to do a little so we are just going to buff this out on the cheekbone and
7:13then around the temples and the hairline
7:16I typically don't like to go too far down on my forehead i like to leave a
7:20nice circle in the center of the forehead as a highlight and then I just
7:23contour by the hair line on the outer portions of my forehead
7:28make sure you blend then we're going to go in with backup cosmetics songbird
7:32blush
7:33this is such a pretty color we are going to start an apple of the cheeks and just
7:37work backward blending into that contour and a going backward on the face towards
7:42the temple to make sure you lightly dust and blend and then we're going to go in
7:46with mac global glow
7:48this is a newer highlighter to mac and this is my first time using it and as
7:52you can see i am already a fan
7:55this is really beautiful on someone with my skin tone over top of a blush if you
7:59want to use this as a specific highlight on the face
8:02you're going to be a few shades Tanner that I am now we're going to go in with
8:05the mac limited edition lipstick in the shade would rose
8:09this is very similar to blankety so it would be ideal for somebody who is again
8:13a shade or two darker and skin tone than me i'm getting all you ten girls many
8:18recommendations throughout this video then i'm going to go over that with
8:21color your smile
8:23coral crazy which is a new lip gloss by them it is a nudie peachy
8:28pinky coral shade it is absolutely beautiful
8:31so after that your look is complete I hope that you guys enjoyed this video
8:35I love you so much as a way to talk to you soon bye
0:13hey guys today I'm finally going to be doing a makeup tutorial using the morphe
0:1835o palette and I am so excited to be doing this you guys because it is so
0:22highly requested not to mention i'm using this palette off-camera literally
0:27almost every single time I do my makeup i'll use at least a shade or two because
0:30I'm still in love with it but I haven't been able to do a tutorial on it because
0:34the fact that it has been sold out for the past six to eight weeks so it is
0:38finally back in stock and I wanted the time I video out so the day came back in
0:42stock is the day I feel my video on with life so that is why it has taken me a
0:47long time to film this video but this is the 350 palette right here as you can
0:51see it is a fall
0:52I shadow dream I mean at least it's my dream when I saw this palette it was
0:56like like you know the heart I'd emoji
1:00that was me in the 350 when we first connected it was a very very magical
1:04little bit past couple of months
1:05I feel like more feet pallets have been like on steroids like I am so
1:10ridiculously impressed with how pigmented and smooth and buttery
1:15it's been a while reviews that word I want to sit here and tell you that morph
1:18use the exact same qualities like makeup geek but i will say that they are
1:22getting closer and closer with every palate because this palette really
1:26impresses me
1:27I did reach out to more fee and I just straight up asked them if they would be
1:29willing to give you guys a little bit more of a discount code because of the
1:33fact that I post this on Instagram about two months ago
1:35rating about how much I loved it and coincidentally the pallets sold out
1:39literally like 15 or 20 minutes later and so many disappointed comments and
1:43tweets and even emails that i asked them if they'd be willing to give you guys a
1:47little bit more of a discount code to help make up for the fact that i did
1:50post about it and then it was just gone
1:52so they did agree to get you guys fifteen percent off and this is only
1:55gonna last for five days because they do not do fifty percent off my normal
2:00discount code jack attack is only for ten percent and that is an affiliation
2:03code but they are going to up it to an extra five percent for you guys
2:07just for a limited time of five days for those of you who really really want to
2:11get this palette but you couldn't so I hope that that's is exciting to you guys
2:15because i was really excited when they agreed to it because i know its hands of
2:19you were really disappointed about not getting this
2:21keep in mind this palette does sell out again it is a permanent items palette is
2:26not going to be gone forever does sell out a couple of times they will keep
2:29coming back
2:30it's not limited edition so don't worry you will be able to get your paws on i
2:33have some point so yeah that's not I'm translators anything else I have to say
2:38oh yeah i did get a spray tan earlier this week and you know i like the way it
2:42came out of my body my skin on my face is not having it and I literally have
2:46like alligator skin and has dry patches all over the place
2:50so in the tutorial if you're wondering what the heck is going on with her skin
2:54it's just my spray tan is all going to be okay i'm sure my skin will be back
2:57from on a couple of days
2:59I don't know why I'm talking about such first world problems right now I you
3:02guys enjoy the video
3:03let's just get into it okay okay my thanks and gave me alligators and there
3:08are people dying in the world Jacqueline
3:10hi everybody so today we're going to be starting off with our skin first and i'm
3:15going to be priming using the new backup backlight priming filter that's a
3:19mouthful
3:20I am loving this primer because it gives your skin such intense luminosity which
3:25is great for someone like me who's looking for the glow who has dry skin
3:28etc so once i have that on i'm going to go in with foundation and i'm going to
3:31be using the Makeup Forever ultra HD stick this has been one of my favorites
3:35for the past month or so
3:36so I'm going to put a line on my chin and two lines on my cheeks that I'm
3:40gonna grab some mac fix+ and more feet foundation brush this is M 439
3:44I'm going to give it a couple of spritz and then i'm going to just buff this out
3:49this foundation is super creamy it's very dewy so if your oily i would
3:52suggest probably staying away from this one because it definitely is going to
3:56give you a luminous dewy finish which is why i love it because I feel looks very
3:59natural on my skin since I am dry to normal
4:03so if you're looking for a dewy foundation the last for a really long
4:06time i would highly suggest this one I love it and a little bit goes a very
4:09long way and it's a medium coverage which is great because recently I
4:13haven't been inside the full intense coverage like I used to
4:16so now i'm going to conceal my under eye area and i'm using the Urban Decay
4:19ultimate coverage concealers that's what it's called about sure but you guys know
4:23what i mean i'll link it down below this is my absolute favorite concealer at the
4:26moment I honestly think it's my favorite concealer of all
4:28I'm you guys it's just so high coverage while still remaining hydrating because
4:33sometimes a really high coverage concealer can get really dry on the
4:36under eye area and make it look kind of creepy and unsettling even more
4:40this is just like the perfect amount of hydration while still being full
4:43coverage so i love it i am using a real techniques damp beauty sponge to blend
4:48this out and then i'm going to go in and set the entire under eye area using the
4:53Kat Von D shade light palette this is her highlight contour kit and these to
4:57highlight shades are basically my favorite highlight shades ever i really
5:01wish that she would sell these individually and not just in the kit
5:03because i would buy them in the pan like hot cakes because i love the formula of
5:08these so much so I'm going to make sure i said that entire area in the v all the
5:12way down the side of my nose up towards the temple and then i'll also dust it
5:15over the eye area that way at prime is my eyes for shadow and shadow will go on
5:20a lot smoother
5:21so now we're going to go in with the morphe 35o and we're going to pick up
5:24this first shade right here and we're going to mix it with the other one that
5:27I'm pointing out that they don't have names so I'm just like this one and this
5:30one
5:31it's like a light brown and a medium tone brown one is a very neutral and a
5:35little bit more is like a camel e warm shade so going in initially with the m4
5:40for one brush this is my morphe it's kind of a long haired blending brush I'm
5:44going to put this right in my crease all the way in the inner corner and blend
5:48out all the way to the outer corner
5:50add the product begins to leave my brush I'm then going to go upwards and start
5:53buffing this out towards my eyebrow
5:56then I'm going to pick up this kind of burnt reddish shade very warm one of my
6:01favorites it reminds me of like a mack brown script or a makeup geek cocoa bear
6:05and just going in with the exact same & 441 brush I'm going to begin to put that
6:09right over top of the first two shades that we initially went in with and i'm
6:13going to again go back and forth and I'm really making sure i go deep into that
6:16inner corner of the eye and then all the way outward and then again
6:20buffing it up and then i'm going to go in with an even a red shade and i'm
6:24going to mix it with this one in the center of the palate
6:27this is going to give me a really really rich red brown this is what's going to
6:31bring a lot of that warmth in those red tones - this looks so if you don't like
6:34those red tones go with a more medium brown in this palette but you guys know
6:38that I can't get enough so that is what i am doing and I'm going in
6:41an e 17 brush my morphe to initially pack on this red brown color and the
6:45inner and the outer corner and then i'm going in with an m4 33 and just making
6:49sure that it's all blended out and we don't have harsh lines this
6:52East 17 brush is great if you're really looking for something small and dense
6:56you can really precisely pack on color but yet you still have some blending
6:59control it's a little bit bigger than a pencil brush so it's still have that
7:03blending shape to it which makes it so great an ideal for something like this
7:07so as you can see i'm leaving the center of my lid blank because we're going to
7:10go in and put something in the center so now i'm going to go in on those - dark
7:14Browns the very bottom and i'm going to mix those together because since i have
7:1835 colors i might as well use as many as possible so i just keep mixing them and
7:21going back in with the exact same
7:23East 17 I'm going to begin to pack that super dark color on the outer corner of
7:26the eye because I just wanted to be a little bit more intensified out there
7:30then going back in with the m4 33 which is just a great blending brush I'm going
7:34to just go over the entire area all the way from inner corner to outer corner to
7:38make sure that it's all blended out we don't have any harsh lines now picking
7:42up this pale orange shade that reminds me a lot of makeup geek tickety
7:46i'm using the same blending brush i'm just going to put this at the very top
7:49of the crease just make sure that everything is nice and blended out and
7:52we have a smooth transition and now i'm going to pick up this very bottom
7:56intense oh my gosh I don't even know what to refer to the shade as it's just
8:00gorgeous
8:01I'm wetting my brush with a little bit of fixed plus i'm going to begin to pack
8:04this color on so i wanted to be super metallic make sure that when you wet
8:08your brush with 6 plus that you don't get soaked
8:11otherwise it's going to kind of meet the purpose and you're not going to pack
8:13that much product on so just a little spritz will do
8:16and then you'll get that really intense foiled pigments had look that I'm going
8:19for
8:20so this shade as you can see is super or super warm it reminds me a lot of makeup
8:25geek flamethrower which is one of their foiled eyeshadows especially when you
8:29wet your brush with fix plus it looks like a foil shadow which is why i use
8:32fix+ so often because you can completely change your eyeshadow look with just a
8:36spritz of fix+ now i'm going to pick up a super dark color at the bottom of the
8:40palette either one of these shades would do and i'm going to use a sigma e 15
8:44definer brush to pack on the shade on to the lower lash line and I'm literally
8:48going to draw this color from the outer corner to the inner corner of my
8:52by using this definer brush and then once we have that intense dark shade on
8:57i will go in and blend this out so it's not so harsh
8:59of course otherwise it looks like you drew it on with a sharpie so picking up
9:02a little bit more of this burnt right shade and a pencil brush I'm going to
9:05just blend this out from the outer corner to the inner corner i really like
9:09my under eyes to personally be smoky I think that they open up my eyes they
9:13bring more attention to your eye color and they just give you a really intense
9:16global smokey look so I always really blend that out on the lower lash line
9:20so now i'm going to fill in my brows nothing special i'm using the Anasazi of
9:23broadway is in the shape taupe Anasazi as browse is my favorite pencil of all
9:27time when it comes to browse when I switched from the mac 12 Anastasio one
9:31it was just like that having gates open because i love it so much
9:35so I am lining my waterline with a vanilla shade pencil but i'm actually
9:39going to take that off in a minute or two and replace it with a black because
9:43i realized i wasn't feelin myself so I'm going to go in with this highlight shade
9:46and a teeny tiny little brush this is an e36 from morphe and it's ideal for
9:51highlighting your inner corner of your eyes i've been loving it recently
9:54it's the little things in life I swear to God literally so after I highlight my
9:57inner corner i'm going to pop just a little bit of that same shade only at
10:01the high point of the brow and kind of blend it downward onto the shadow itself
10:05now i'm just going to give my lashes a coat of mascara because i am going to
10:09prep them for lashes
10:10don't feel like you need to wear lashes but I'm a last girl and I wear them all
10:13the time so i'm gonna pop some on and today i am using the new Sophia lashes
10:18by Sophia chang who is known as fashionista 804 here on Instagram she
10:22collaborated with velour to make these lashes and i have to say they're one of
10:25my favorite styles by them i love them so much and i will definitely be showing
10:29you guys them again because they are so gorgeous
10:33perfect for a smoky eye I've been wearing them with minor without liner on
10:37a day-to-day basis on a smoky basis so I'm all about these lashes right now
10:40congratulations girl
10:42so I am a scurrying my love mascara i am putting mascara on my lower lashes and
10:47then i'm going in with some eyeliner this is the ardency Inn eyeliner in
10:51black because I realized I was not liking that vanilla liner I wanted
10:55something a little bit smoke year so I went over it with a black kohl little
10:58bit and just completely cover it up and made it darker and smoke year which i
11:02liked way better
11:03and then I go back and with that same Sigma
11:0515 definer brush and just kind of smoke out and blend out that liner
11:09since you can't see what I'm doing some looking straight down i'm explaining it
11:11to you instead
11:13so now for cheeks i'm going to be using the mac cosmetics sculpting powder in
11:17the shade shade stirrer which I've talked about a few times i love it so
11:21much and i am using the NARS eat a brush which I have really fallen in love with
11:25recently and I'm going to be contouring my cheeks and I'm doing kind of a hike
11:28on tour today meaning i am sculpting starting a little bit higher by the ear
11:33and bring it down a more intense decline down by the mouth because i wanted to
11:38get that kind of sharp intense contour and i'm just going to blend that around
11:41on the forehead and i'm going to pick up some of the laura mercier translucent
11:45powder and then i am using this intense sculpting brush from morphe and what I'm
11:49going to do is put this powder right underneath my contour and I'm going to
11:53blend it all the way down on the rest of the face by the jaw bone
11:56this is going to set that powder so that I'm sorry set that foundation so that it
12:00doesn't wear off throughout the day because my foundation always leave the
12:03lower half of my face because I'm like leaning on my arm or something and I'm
12:07going to go in and blend all of that out and just immediately erase it so that
12:11everything is nice and set and sharp sharp and then i'm going to go in with
12:16some blush and this is the NARS luster blush and i'm using the morphe e4 blush
12:21brush
12:21I love this blush I don't know how old it is I don't even know if it's still
12:25available but if it is i will link it down below if i can find it but i have
12:28been loving it
12:29and now i'm going to highlight my cheeks using what do you what do you know
12:33champagne pop I'm so surprised i'm so surprised i'm using champagne pop aren't
12:36you using a more fee and 50 1 i'm going to just dust this all over the very high
12:41points of my cheeks and then blending it downward today I'm keeping it more on
12:45the high points and not so much on the apples
12:48I usually blend it down there but not today i'm going to go in with a very
12:51nude lip to begin
12:53I wanted to show you guys options so this is occ lip tar in the shade
12:57interlace and i'm going to go over it with one of my favorite with glasses at
13:00the moment which is nars Chelsea girl so you can see what this look would look
13:04like if you chose to do a nude lip
13:07i personally like this i think it's very pretty but i wanted to do something a
13:10little more dramatic because i rarely do bold and bold but recently I've been
13:14having fun with these fall looks so i'm going to show you what it looks like
13:17when we go to a bold lip
13:18and bull dies so i am using the Anasazi lip tar lip paint
13:23I'm sorry in the shade vamp and i'm going to put that all over my entire
13:27lips as normal
13:29I'm not going to go too hard on the center of the lip though because I'm
13:31about to cover that up with a little bit of a person and i am going to just dab
13:35this right in the center of the lip and tapping motions on the bottom and then
13:39I'm going to take my finger
13:41once I have this tapped all over the center and i'm going to begin to just
13:45kind of balance my finger up and down on my lips to blend this out we're doing an
13:48ombre lip but I didn't want it to be too intense or over the top
13:52so I'm just pouting and buffing this out with the tip of my finger and I want the
13:56most intense of this brightness to be in the very very center of the lip like you
14:01just got them sucking on a strawberry
14:03that's how it's supposed to look so what we've done that I'm going to set my base
14:07with Urban Decay Jill makeup setting spray and this look is complete

1:53requested I know you guys want to see it so i'll do it for you but this look is
1:56something i will personally wear again for sure

2:07appropriate if you want to darken it up and they get more sexy
2:11he's not work on camera just so uncomfortable with like you want to make

2:25thank you so much for watching and love you guys go follow Kathleen I'll see you
2:29soon bye
2:29first thing I'm going to do is prime my face i'm using makeup forever radiance
2:34primer using clean fingers of course because we do not want to spread any
2:37bacteria or germs
2:38I'm going to massages all over my entire face then I'm going to take the same
2:43makeup forever line using the smoothing primer
2:46I'm going to take this and just rub it in my t-zone I know this seems excessive
2:50to use two primers but I've just been loving the way it makes my skin look
2:53recently them for extra hydration because i am dry i'm going to spread
2:57some max mac fix+ all over my face and I'm going to go in with my foundation
3:01I've been loving the dior new dare serum foundation recently I've raved about a
3:05couple of times it's just my absolute favorite at the moment it's a shared
3:08medium coverage just looks so natural and blends beautifully and i am using
3:12the Sigma f80 flat top kabuki to just massage that and blend it all over my
3:17entire face then we are going to go in with urban decay and naked concealer
3:22I'm going to put this in the entire under eye area and a triangle shape kind
3:26of down the side of my nose and up towards my temple and i will also put on
3:30my eyelid and i will blend that out with a damp Beauty Blender
3:34the reason i put on my eyelid is because it will help me prime for eyeshadow i
3:37don't usually use an actual eye shadow primer
3:40this is my way of priming and color correcting at the same time I'm gonna
3:43take that same highlighter
3:44i'm going to put on the top to the cheeks the chin the Cupid's bow the
3:47center of the nose and make a little flower in the center of my forehead as
3:50well just to kind of even out that very subtle highlight it's not that light but
3:55it's kind of then i'm going to set the under eye area with some powder and move
3:59forward
3:59i'm going in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow as my first shade i
4:04am using a sigma e40 eyeshadow brush to blend this out
4:07this is just an absolute must color for me it just works so great with my skin
4:11tone and it works for a transition shade to make all the colors that i use blend
4:15seamlessly
4:16it just works for my skin tone it might not work for everyone but i honestly
4:19can't live without it
4:20now i'm going to go in with ardency Inn eyeliner and this is in the shade
4:24black what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to smudge this all along my
4:27lash line just very messily not doing anything in particular
4:31then with any brush this is a morphe brush ride on the number i'm sorry but
4:35i'm going to just blend this out back and forth and you do not have to make it
4:39a seamless blending application just blending it upwards
4:42this is going to help give our lash line depth when we go in with more shades
4:46now i'm going to go in with the first shade which is called Cornelius
4:50I'm going to go in with an e 25 brush from sigma and just put that in the
4:53entire crease area going back and forth and windshield wiper motions all the way
4:57to the inner corner all the way to the outer corner back and forth I want this
5:01to be just as dark in the inner corner as I do in the outer corner
5:04I really want this to be very rounded and very smoky
5:07now i'm going to go in with my favorite color which is blaze i'm using my finger
5:10to apply this because honestly it's just what's going to work best so why not use
5:14the best tools that God gave you so using my minutes
5:17middle finger I'm going to rub that in the eye shadow and Pat it all over my
5:20entire lid
5:21once i have packed a good amount of that on going to go back and with the e25
5:25brush from sigma and blend it out because if you just use your finger it's
5:29going to be kind of hard not to have harsh lines so i'm going to go in just
5:33to make sure that's completely blended and then I will pack even a little bit
5:37more on the center of my lid because I wanted to be really intense in the very
5:41center of my lid then going in with the shade kathleenlights I'm going to pack
5:46this on the center of the lid as well and i'm using a mac 242 brush
5:49I don't know why I even picked up the brush it's not necessary just use your
5:52fingers for this part as well because I go back in with my fingers you can see
5:55and I kind of blend that together
5:56I just wanted an extra pop right in the center of that lid I'm going to fill in
6:00my eyebrows with anastacio browse in the shade taupe
6:03but i'm going to skip right through that because you've seen you fill my brows
6:06and it's just not fun to watch
6:08so now i'm going to take the exact same colors that i use on the upper lid and
6:12i'm going to put them on the lower lash line literally the same thing in the
6:16same order
6:16i'm going to put them on the lower lash line I'm taking the e25 from sigma and
6:20I'm going to meet that outer corner and very softly kind of smoke it out so it
6:24gives a very subtle kind of cat I appearance with that light medium brown
6:29shade as you can see it's very subtle but it kind of brings the eyes outward
6:32and upward then i'm going in with an e 15 from sigma and i'm going to go back
6:36in with the shade
6:37blaze and just coat the whole lower lash line then grabbing a pencil brush I'm
6:41going to go in with kathleen lights for just a really big
6:44full glow on top all three shades that are on the top right up on the lower
6:48lash line and then we are going to separate them by going in with a very
6:52creamy kind of ivory white pencil
6:54this is a mac pro pencil so I will link it down below for you guys in the
6:57description bar if you're having a hard time finding it i'll make it easier for
7:00you
7:01this is my favorite white pencil ever because it's not too white it's got a
7:05very kind of fleshy creamy vibe to it and it just gives a very different look
7:09when you're working with a smoky eye and makes it much more daytime appropriate
7:12then you can exchange it for a black eyeliner at night and make it more night
7:14appropriate
7:15I'm going to be going in with lashes and today I'm using a brand called wink wink
7:19lashes in the style Tribeca
7:22I love these because they're fluffy and their girly but yet they also have like
7:26kind of a spike eNOS to them and they give a lot of definition to the iso
7:29they're absolutely beautiful
7:31now i'm going to go in and cut my lower lashes with mascara
7:34whatever mascara will do my favorite lower lash mascara as always is mac
7:38duggal blacklash there's something about the wand it's just so small precise
7:41it's just my favorite for lower lashes now i'm going to go in and bronze my
7:45face
7:45well it started off with the idea of bronzing and then it kind of turned into
7:48contour
7:49whoops sorry story of my life i am using the Wayne Goss brush number 13 which is
7:54a beautiful brush for bronzer application and i am using hoola bronzer
7:57benefit to do this i'm going to just give my cheeks definition and i'm also
8:01going to sculpt the forehead as well and i will just blend until my arms hurt and
8:06my hands feel like they're going to fall off and then I'm going to go in with a
8:10lighter shade i'm using the anastacio banana powder i believe using the kat
8:15von d brush that came out with her shade light palette i'm just going to do this
8:19because this helps give just the face and more sculpted look because like i
8:22said at first I wasn't playing on contouring but then I was like I changed
8:25my mind
8:26I want to contour so here we go we're doing it I'm going to contour underneath
8:29I'm sorry highlight underneath the eyes and on the forehead as well to even
8:32everything out then going in with becca songbird blush blush is my current
8:38obsession
8:39I am so in love with it it is so absolutely ridiculously beautiful as you
8:42can see right here on camera it is just the most gorgeous war me pinky
8:46amazingness that ever happened to my cheeks
8:49now i'm going to go in with the new color pop highlighter and this is in the
8:53shade
8:53smokin whistles such a gorgeous shade so I do recommend
8:57recommend using this with your finger you can use a brush as you see me doing
9:01right here but I'm going back and forth between two morphe brushes applying this
9:03but honestly if you just use your finger
9:06it'll work absolute beautiful because I ended up just using my finger to do my
9:09chin and my Cupid's bow was kind of a smooth kind of squishy moose e
9:13water-based highlight so it is what it is
9:16use your finger you'll be good then I went in with the same Cornelius
9:19eyeshadow and just put a little bit underneath my lower lip just to give
9:22kind of a fuller powder your lower lip going on
9:24i'm going to use colour-pop lippie Stix in the shade bounded which is my
9:28favorite nude pink ever buy them and then i'm going to finish off this look
9:31with Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray and your look is complete
9:35so I hope that you guys enjoy this video thanks so much for watching I love you
9:38and I'll see you soon
0:25hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look right
0:30here
0:31obviously I'm so unprepared for this intro because i'm actually getting ready
0:35to leave for dinner i'm actually leaving in about 30 minutes from now and i
0:40thought that i would fill message like send up all my equipment and record
0:43myself getting ready for tonight because i knew i wanted to do something super
0:45dramatic so i thought was recorded make it easy so I'm very unprepared for this
0:50intro i have seen no idea i'm calling this look all I know is I came across an
0:54old photo of me and john from when I was 18 years old and I'm wearing like this
0:58exact smokey eye except there was a little little junkie but that's okay
1:03um I used to rock these colors like every day for a year and a half and when
1:07I saw this picture i was like i am not done those colors and such a long time
1:11so I felt very inspired to redo the look that used to wear and I was 18 years old
1:15so I absolutely love love the smoky eye we are working with gold and cranberries
1:20and purples
1:21it's such a pretty color combination and I made it really dramatic and really
1:25edgy as you can tell I really smoke - I made like an intense cat I knew of
1:28course the modified for your face
1:30- what fits your needs you do not have to make it as edgy and angular's I did
1:34you can soften it a little bit not as much product but you don't mean I'm
1:38going to do it all
1:39I'm gonna do it all so yeah I hope that you guys enjoy this video thank you so
1:44much for watching I Love You a season
1:46hey guys well hello
1:49let's transform this message shall we ok let's get started first thing I'm doing
1:53is priming my eyes as always
1:55and i still use the mac pro longwear concealer because it's just my absolute
1:58favorite way to prime my eyes ever
2:01then I'm going to be going in with the one the only scotch tape
2:04any brand of table work but i'm using scotch just using a tiny bit like an
2:08inch inch and a half of tape and I'm going to put on the back of my hand
2:11I'm going to peel off put on my hand again peeled off again this is just
2:14going to take a little bit of the stickiness away so it's not too harsh on
2:17the eye area
2:18what I'm going to do is put this underneath the eye and a diagonal line
2:21from the corner of my eye up to my brow really focusing and concentrating
2:24because I want them to be as symmetrical as possible because it'll make your life
2:27a whole lot easier if they're symmetrical to begin with
2:30I'm going to go in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow I know I know
2:34ok
2:34you can use maxima silk bamboo you can use bobby brown toast they all have a
2:39similar vibe to them but makeup geek peach smoothie
2:41that is like my ride or die that's my girl so I'm going to blend that in the
2:44entire crease from inner corner to outer corner and then I'm going to go and with
2:47makeup geek creme brulee
2:49this is another go to shade for me and that personally works for my skin tone
2:52for a great transition color and my crease
2:55whatever works for you will ever go to call that you have in your collection
2:57that will work just fine for this look so i am using a sigma e40 to blend this
3:01back and forth all the way from the inner corner to outer corner and then
3:05i'm going to go in with a little bit more precise brush I'm using the morphe
3:08em for three three for this
3:10you can also use a sigma e25 if you have that brush as well and i'm just going
3:13back in with creme brulee and the crease just to make it a little bit more dark
3:16then i'm going to be going in with an emergency in shadow and the shade copper
3:20I don't know why this is called copper because as you can see it is not a
3:23copper color
3:24i did a wet in my mac 242 brush with a little bit of fix plus because I wanted
3:28just to be super metallic and very vibrant and shiny and I inner corner
3:32this is a beautiful pure gold like it looks like a bar of gold which is why I
3:37love it so so much so i'm going to put that on the whole inner corner area and
3:41then just kind of fade out in the middle of the lid
3:44I'm not going to cover my entire lid with this just focusing on the inner
3:47corner of the eye then i'm going to go in with one of my old school all time
3:50favorites this is Mac copper ring eye shadow
3:53I told you guys before how back in my mac days other fellow like employees
3:57would call me copper ring because I would wear this every single day that it
4:01became my nickname
4:02so using that same 242 brush I'm going to pack that right over top of that gold
4:06and the center of the lid and then i'm going to go in with one of my favorite
4:10Purple's of all time and this is deep damson again this is by Mac this is a
4:15pro color i believe it's still a pro color I don't know if matt has changed
4:18in the last couple of years but you can get on that cosmetics . com just like
4:21anything else that is a pro product so using a pencil brush i am just going to
4:25really focus this on that outer crease of my eye
4:28this is where that tape really comes in handy because you can be as messy as you
4:31want to be and that tape is going to keep it nice and sharp and clean for you
4:35which is why i absolutely love this method so as you can see i'm just
4:38packing it all over that outer corner kind of focusing on that v-shape and
4:42then taking it up into the crease try to keep this purple as low as possible in
4:46your crease and don't take it too
4:47initially because as we start to blend it will begin to go higher and higher so
4:51try to initially keep that purple nice and low
4:54that way the more you blend the higher it goes i am using the morphe and 433
4:58brush to again
4:59blend this up and then I'll go back in with the sigma e40 just to make sure
5:03that there are no harsh lines you know how it is you go from bottom to top and
5:07then you blend blend blend you want to use the smaller blending brushes for the
5:10bottom and the bigger for the top so as you see I'm using a pencil brush now
5:13then i'll go and with the morphe and 433 then i'll go on with the bigger the e-40
5:17picking up a little bit of cocoa bear by makeup geek now which is another one of
5:21my absolute favorite shadows
5:23we're going to put just a little bit of that in the crease area because I felt
5:26like that purple wasn't blending as seamlessly as I wanted it to
5:29so sometimes picking up another shade will just really help with the blending
5:33process making it look super smooth which is why i use that now i'm going to
5:37go back and was a little bit more coppering because in that blending
5:39process
5:40I felt like I kind of lost the pop of that copper shade and I really want to
5:44have a nice gradient transition from gold to copper to purple
5:47so we're going to touch that up in the center of the lid now i'm going to go
5:50ahead and remove the scotch tape and you can see the big reveal of what we have
5:55on that outer corner now due to the scotch tape
5:58i'm going to use a face wipe any sort of makeup remover will do and i'm just
6:03going to clean up this under eye area because you'll see like everything kind
6:06of disappear we had tons and tons of fault that you don't always notice but
6:09when you have that scotch tape you can really see all that follow on the cheek
6:12so i'm going to remove all of the fall that we have that i'm going to go in
6:16with a q-tip because sometimes using scotch tape that line can be super duper
6:21harsh
6:22so using a clean cotton q-tip i will just go in and kind of rub back and
6:26forth and this will soften that line so that it's not like whoa that's intense
6:30and I'm saying it will make it just a little bit softer on the outer edges
6:34now i'm going to be doing my finer i'm using Maybelline as always this is like
6:38my favorite eyeliner ever it is from the drugstore the price is right and I swear
6:42like there's no i mean i've ever used that is a gel liner they're like better
6:45than this one so i am very thankful for maybelline making this liner and as you
6:50can see because we use that scotch tape to make that really precise harsh line
6:54on the edge
6:55it really acts as a great guide for your wing
6:57the liner which is awesome because it makes it that much easier now i'm going
7:01to cut my lashes and any mascara will do for this because i'm going to be going
7:04in with false lashes anyways i'm going to be using a lily lashes in the style
7:09Mykonos
7:10these are my new favorite lashes this is the fourth time I have worn the style
7:14and I'm just the one love with them they are very dramatic
7:16if you haven't heard of Lily lashes yet they are awesome i just tried them for
7:20the first time this past month and i'll link them down below for you guys who
7:23want to go ahead and check it out for yourself
7:25now i'm going to be priming my skin using and make up for ever radiance
7:28primer and the reason I'm using the radiance primer today is because I'm
7:31gonna be going in with the LC cosmetics mikrosil foundation and as I have talked
7:36about this foundation before it is a little bit more on the dryer matte side
7:39so i like to use a radiance primer and i'm also going to spritz my brush with
7:43some mac fix+ this is the m4 39 foundation brush that I've been raving
7:47about
7:48I swear this brush the foundation are a match made in heaven
7:51and i am currently between the shade natural and sand depending if I have
7:56self tan or not I know if you people have asked about my shade in the LC
8:00foundation and if you guys are wanting to try it i do have a limited coupon
8:04code it's not going to last too much longer and i will put that down below
8:07for you guys
8:08again thank you so much too late for giving this cold because i was very
8:11generous of her
8:12so now i'm going to be filling in eyebrows i'm using the Anasazi or browse
8:16in the shade taupe and I have actually really changed the way I do my brows I
8:21make them much center now and I'm just very happy with them they're not
8:23overboard like I feel like they used to be so yay for finally feeling like my
8:28brows are getting to a happy place
8:30I'm going to be concealing my under eye area using my absolute obsession at the
8:34moment which is this Urban Decay Naked concealer i know i say in every video
8:38but i swear this like my favorite concealer of all time I think this
8:41concealer would work the best for all different skin types if you have fine
8:44lines if you have wrinkles to dry under area whatever it may be it is just an
8:48amazing amazing consider that will work for so many different people so i am
8:52using this in a shade lighter than my skin tone so because of that i will also
8:55put a little bit of it on the chin in between the eyebrows and a little dab of
8:59it on the center of the forehead as well just to balance out that highlight and
9:02other areas of my face because I don't we just want the under eyes to be a
9:05highlight i really want to kind of balances out so that it looks morning
9:09actual I know natural really huh full face of makeup but still it will
9:12actually balance out and make everything come together much more beautifully in
9:16the end and then i'm going to set my under eye area with powder so I don't
9:19have any creasing and i am using the anastacio banana powder that comes in
9:23her contour kit and it's also sold separately on her website and I mix that
9:27with the mac pro emphasize which is like a stark white powder i mix those two
9:32together from my personal perfect highlight shade and i will just go ahead
9:35and set the under eye
9:36now i'm going to go in with who faced a bronzer ok if you watch my husband tag
9:41then you know i am saying food face
9:43we're going to be going in with the to face and bronzer this is the chocolate
9:46Soleil one and i am using an oldie but a goodie and this is the NARS eat a brush
9:51you guys know that this has been like a rider die brush for me and then I wasn't
9:54using it for quite a while and i am back on the e to brush big time I love it so
9:58much for contouring i still stand behind this brush so much i just think it is
10:01amazing it's just a foolproof for contouring I swear it just makes it so
10:05simple so I also going to be browsing the forehead just to even that out as
10:09any time i contour I always have to go on the temples and the hair line just to
10:12make everything come together and i am using the morphe for brush I use this
10:16for bronzing i use it for contouring i use it for blush
10:18I've told you guys this brush is just like my favorite thing right now it's
10:22just got the smoothest bristles it's just so easy to work with
10:25now I'm going to line my waterline this is like the creepy shot ever right
10:29I was like you was so we're just gonna go ahead and cut that i use the arden
10:34see in black eyeliner to line my inner water line and then using a precision
10:39brush this is the sigma e 15 flat definer we're going to take a little bit
10:42more of that purple that deep damson i'm going to just rub that all over the
10:46lower lash line all the way from inner corner to outer corner and then taking a
10:50pencil brush this is the morphe 18 with a little bit of that copper ring shade
10:54on it
10:54I'm going to lightly dust over so we have that purple and that copper smoked
10:58out underneath the lower lash line and then i'm going to coat my lashes with
11:02mascara you can see that doing that to the lower lash line really pull this
11:06look together and just makes everything look super smoky and it makes your eyes
11:09pop
11:10i'm going to be using a mac
11:12Melba for my blush which is one of my all-time favorites it's a matte blush
11:16and it's beautiful on a very wide range of skin tones that I used to sell this
11:19blush more than any other shade when i worked at Mac because it just looks
11:23gorgeous on everybody it's so easy to wear and now of course we are going to
11:26be highlighting and i'm going to be using a champagne pop the highlighter
11:29that i created with becca cosmetics because i can't get enough of the shade
11:32right now let's get real
11:34i'm going to be using the morphe and 501 brush to apply this on the high points
11:37of my cheekbones
11:39this is my favorite highlighter brush until something better comes along this
11:42has been this has been my ride or die for my highlights and i'm also going to
11:46be taking a champagne pop and putting it right on the top of that brow bone just
11:49to kind of tie that whole look together i love how am I brow bone especially if
11:54i'm doing a super smoky look I just think that polishes it off
11:57I'm going to go in with house of dollars lipstick and the shade she is a very
12:01nude pale peachy pink as you can see extremely nude so i added a mineralized
12:06glass from Mac over top of it man a lot of a lot of mac products today
12:10I didn't mean to do that i am using the shade be nice which is a beautiful coral
12:13shade
12:14one of my favorite glosses especially by mac and then finish it off
12:17i'm going to use some fix+ and we are done
12:20call it a day I hope you guys enjoy this look thank you so much for watching you
12:24know I love you and I'll see you soon bye guys
0:00hey guys so today's tutorial is going to be on this silver and white
0:06cool tone soft cut crease perfect for the holidays
0:09thank you so much for everyone who requested a look incorporating these
0:12colors you guys totally got me out of my comfort zone so if you like what you see
0:16it go ahead and please subscribe and let's get started
0:20I was freezing while filming this video is I'm going to be wearing this gigantic
0:24robe
0:25I hope you guys don't mind I know I look a polar bear but I'm gonna start off by
0:28priming my face using the cover FX illuminating primer this is my first
0:32time using it and I actually really liked it
0:35I'm gonna be going in with the LC a mikrosil foundation and i am using the
0:39morphe and 439 foundation brush and I did spritz it with some map fix plus
0:44because mac fix+ has glycerin in it and it's ninety percent water so it just
0:48makes the skin super hydrated and actually helps the foundation to stick
0:51to your skin and to the foundation itself for concealer today i'm going to
0:55be using the new make up for ever HD concealer this is my third time now
1:00using it and I am loving this concealer it goes on very very creamy I was
1:05nervous it's going to be super Creasy when I first applied it was very very
1:08dewy and very creamy but this is like I said my third time trying it and i've
1:12set it with powder each time and i have been loving it
1:15it's very full coverage it blends out really beautifully I'm not getting any
1:18creasing throughout the day
1:20it looks nice and natural i'm i'm really loving you guys
1:23so now i'm going to set everything using the laura mercier loose translucent
1:26setting powder
1:27i'm going to make the most attractive face of life to set the under eye area
1:30as always
1:31and i'm going to run this brush across my entire face i'm going to completely a
1:34mattify myself which I actually wish I didn't do
1:37once this look was overall i wish i was a little bit do here for this specific
1:40look but that's okay because life goes on even when you have a mad face
1:44so now for the eyes and you start off using the mac shadow in the shade kid
1:48and I'm initial going in with the morphe m4 for one brush I'm going to try to
1:52keep this high up in the crease area as you can see i'm not going to go on the
1:55lid because of the fact that we're doing a cut crease the shadow kid is
1:59absolutely amazing
2:00if you are looking for an amazing a transition color that's not too warm not
2:03too cool
2:04I would really highly suggest the shade kid it's so wearable
2:08now i'm going to go in with Bobby Brown cement and as you can see this is a very
2:12nice light pale cool grey and now i'm using a smaller blending brush and this
2:17is the morphe and 433 because we're gonna get a little bit tighter in that
2:20crease as you can see i'm still not going on the lid
2:22I'm staying just in that crease area and want to keep it only in that upper
2:27crease
2:28now another bobby brown eyeshadow this is hot stone which is just a darker gray
2:32from the cement
2:33I'm really going one step at a time because when you're doing a cut crease
2:36you don't want to initially just go on like with this intense dark color it's
2:39gonna be kind of difficult to blend out so I like to start with a light shade
2:44and go one darker one darker one darker and that's really going to give you that
2:47really beautiful blended effect so that's just you know lessons and
2:51blending 101
2:52now we're going to go in with anastacio deep brown this is a very deep brown one
2:56hundred percent cool shade and now i am using the morphe and 507 and this is a
3:00very Stinney precise brush that's perfect for look like this when you're
3:04doing a cut crease so as you can see I'm only keeping this on the outer corner of
3:07the eye
3:08I'm not going to bring this all the way into the inner corner otherwise we're
3:10gonna start to look very 60s which is super cool but not what i'm going for in
3:14this specific look so I'm keeping it on the outer corner and I want the main
3:17darkness to be right on the outer edge of my eye and kind of faded up as we go
3:23then I'll go back with that 433 brush and just make sure it's blended out
3:26I was just going back in with a little bit of kid or cement one of those light
3:30shades on your brush just a little bit just to blend that out so that nothing
3:33is harsh again avoiding the actual lid area
3:36strictly staying on the upper crease once i blended that I realize I want to
3:40just a touch more of the anastacio so I went back in which is a little bit more
3:44of deep brown now we're going to go on with this makeup forever palette
3:47this is a new palette a sephora i love these shadows they are so pigmented so
3:53beautiful and I wanted to go in with this really bright white
3:57if you don't have this palette i would suggest something like mac crystal
4:00avalanche or like mac vanilla pigment you could even just using the next like
4:04jumbo white pencil but i really love the shadows and I had the palate sitting in
4:08front of me so I wanted to use them and as you can see they are pigmented as
4:11heck this is not using a wet brush or anything this is just the color payoff
4:16which is so amazing so I am using a mac 242 to apply that which is just a
4:21flattop synthetic hair brush and that will any flat synthetic brush will apply
4:26it like shimmers the best and now we're gonna be going in with mac platinum
4:30pigment
4:30this is my favorite silver of all time it is a true
4:34true silver platinum and I'm going to put this on the middle of the eye and
4:37the outer area of the I i really wanted to be kind of on break the inner corners
4:41stock white and a face like a platinum silver
4:44so using that same 242 I'm going to begin to press down on the outer corner
4:47of the eye and I'm going to actually going to use it to clean up that cut
4:50crease so if you were messy at all you have any fall on your lid this is your
4:53time to really kind of carpet and go back and forth to make it nice and sharp
4:57again i'm taking a little bit more of the Anasazi a deep brown and that same
5:01more feet 507 brush I'm going to put a little bit more just to make sure that
5:05it's nice and sharp but yet still blended that make sense to shop and
5:09whether you got me you're keeping up
5:11so now we're going in with mac pro emphasize this is a highlighting powder
5:15and i'm going to just put that in the inner corner of the eye to really
5:17highlight
5:18I'm going to dabble a little bit over that inner corner highlight that we have
5:21going on
5:22I'm going to bring it all the way up so it's kind of going towards the brow area
5:26to make everything nice and soft and i'm going to bring it underneath the eye
5:28area
5:29about halfway and on that lower lash line
5:32I really wanted the inner corner of my eye to pop and look very icy so I was
5:36putting a lot of this all over that inner rim but I didn't want it to be too
5:40frosty that's why I didn't go in with like mac nylon I wanted to still have
5:44kind of a mat inner corner of the eye that's why i chose that now for my brows
5:49i am using the Anasazi railways as always i'm so excited for her new brow
5:53product to come out have you guys seen her pencil on her instagram i'm like
5:56dying i'm so excited to try it because im so diehard for the brows
6:00I love it so much so I can't wait anything that she developed for the
6:03brows
6:03I'm so fangirl about it's ridiculous
6:07now i'm going to go in the house of lashes boudoir eyelashes god I just love
6:12the name of these lashes they're just so fun to say i was going to pop those on
6:16the upper lash line as you see i did not apply any liner
6:20go ahead and apply some minor if you want you can do a wing you can do a
6:23smokey liner you can do just a straight line whatever you want but I don't want
6:26to apply any liner I wanted to keep this look nice and simple and i'm going to go
6:30back in with that same anastasi a deep brown again I'm gonna pop that on the
6:34lower lash line and I'm going to keep that strictly on the outer corner of my
6:38eye only I do not want to bring it in and start getting that lower lash line
6:42to smokey I want to really keep that highlight nice and bright
6:44on the inner corner and then using any pencil brush I'm is going to buff it out
6:49I did put a little bit of kid on my pencil brush that we have a lighter
6:52color to buff it out because it's hard to buff out of color not using a lighter
6:56one so since i put the dark one
6:57I pick up a little bit of a lighter shade and I buff it out so it's nice and
7:00blended and smoky only on the lower half of the eye
7:05you'll see after I do this step how much like my eyes are going to look open and
7:09make them pop and that's the point of this this look and these steps i'm
7:13applying is a vanilla liner it does not matter which one because what I'm going
7:16to do next is I'm going to go back with that exact same white that we use on the
7:20eyes
7:21the tiny little precision brush you can use a q-tip if you want i'm going to pop
7:24that right on top of my waterline and basically what we're going to do is it's
7:28going to keep that water line really bright the entire day
7:31it will also make it so that it doesn't bleed it doesn't move it doesn't fade
7:35and it's also going to make your eyes pop way more if you just have a stark
7:39white eyeliner you can use that but i did not have that I ran out
7:43I don't know where it went i haven't had it in years so this is what I did
7:48setting your liner with powder and your waterline is a really great way to make
7:52it last the entire day doe
7:53so if you guys have issues with it moving and running so now for bronzer
7:57i'm going to be using the hourglass luminous bronzer light my sister is the
8:00one that introduced this bronzer to me and it is so beautiful so i would highly
8:04suggest it for those of you who are very fair out there because my sister is very
8:07very light like milky colored skin and it looks gorgeous on her
8:10I'm not going to lie i am very flustered by how they showed up on camera it looks
8:14blotchy it
8:15it just doesn't look good it's causing me stress but we're going to move past
8:18that ok move past it
8:20for blush I'm going to be going in with the bomb our guile argyle is the name of
8:24the blush and it's just this beautiful matte babydoll pink
8:27the bomb has such great blushes and I think no one ever talks about them but
8:30they're so good there be honestly such a beautiful formulas i love them
8:35i'm going to go over that with you Bobby Brown shimmer brick in the shade
8:38pink and i'm going to put that right on the apples of the cheeks because i
8:41personally would have gone in with a light babydoll pink lip which is what I
8:45exchange it for after I got done filming and pink cheeks but i wanted to do
8:48something different because I know a lot of you guys have really been in
8:51- these kind of dark purple emami brown shades recently but i really love a pink
8:56lip with this look
8:57side note for the highlight I'm using champagne pop and pearl pearl is now
9:01permanent buyback us if you're interested in that you can purchase it
9:03separately
9:04it is not just in this palette anymore they just release it which is super
9:07exciting that such a beautiful unique really really light highlight for those
9:12of you who are super fair
9:13i'm also going to highlight my Cupid's bow then i'm going to set my face using
9:16the Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray and I want to do this first before
9:20I apply these little gems on the inner corner of my eyes that way at the Urban
9:24Decay makeup spray didn't like wet in them and make them move or slide around
9:27from the wetness of the spray
9:29so I'm going to use one of these little rhinestones is a pack of like I don't
9:32know a thousand of these little rhinestones I got it from amazon it was
9:35like 299 for this pack using tweezers I'm literally just going to pop it on
9:39the inner corner of my eye it's so easy and if they don't have an adhesive on
9:42the back just put a dot eyelash glue on it wait 20 seconds and pop it on and
9:46you're good to go so easy you can put these all of your lid to which will look
9:49gorgeous for the lips i'm going to use color pop stingray
9:52this was developed by it's my right here on YouTube congratulations girl it's
9:56beautiful
9:56I've had mixed emotions about these color pop liquid lips but this one is
10:00gorgeous it's beautiful the formulas great the price point is amazing so this

0:56life like he's just a snuggler and he's just so sleepy and adorable and sweet
1:00but he's got a science that and i wish you guys Christine him when i first got
1:05him because he's already doubled the size double he was half the size of this

1:15follow me on snapchat on Twitter and all that jazz and you would know we have had
1:19a quite the fiasco getting Georgie used to Frankie it was horrible

1:28trainer as well and just kind of take it very slow and very patient and so now
1:33Frankie is home and georgian him really are getting along Georgie only has like
1:37outbursts maybe it once or twice a day holes big enough but for the most part
1:41they're doing great so it is wonderful he's such a little joy and for those of

2:16tutorial lost my train of a lot of makeup tutorial on the look that i have
2:19on right here
2:20i asked you guys on Twitter if you want to see something dramatic or more
2:23natural or neutral and ninety-five percent of you guys that a dramatic
2:28drama all caps with explanations and I was like oh my god
2:32so you guys asked for it heroes I wanted to do something cool tone because you
2:37know i love my warm tones and I I feel like I'm not as intense my warm tones
2:42here my channel I used to be though I definitely transition more like neutral
2:46side because if i had my way you guys I don't you understand i would be wearing
2:50like a brick red wrapped around my eyes every day with like 3d mean clashes like
2:56that right there is life to me
2:59thank you kids so I just decided to go with a classic black and gray and silver
3:03smoky eye
3:05I've never done a look like this before I have been a silver and black tutorial
3:08but what's different about this is there's no liner
3:11there's no intense wing there's no sharp edge this is so rounded and blown out it
3:16literally looks like smoke on the eye which is just like my favorite look of
3:21all time I absolutely love it
3:23this is a very sexy it is definitely appropriate for a night out so i hope
3:27you guys enjoy if you do this video thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe

3:37i love you guys so much i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and i'll see you
3:40soon bye guys
3:41oh my god towards you and Frank you're legit colleague right now mama can't
3:46take it
3:47hello my love's so today we are going to be starting with our skin so i am going
3:53to go in with a primer i'm using makeup forever
3:56radiant primer and i'm going to massage this all over the skin
3:59you know the drill with primer let's move past that i'm also going to be
4:03using a new product i have not used on camera before and this is by the brand
4:06Tata and thus a luminous dewy skin miss i bought this solely because of the fact
4:10that Kim Kardashian uses it and I wanted
4:12glow so I've been trying it out and i love it i will talk more about it and an
4:16upcoming video though so just hang tight i'm going in with the LC micro silk
4:21foundation absolutely love this foundation I've been raving about it now
4:24for quite a few videos and it is like my non-stop go to i am applying that using
4:28a foundation brush by more feet this is the e 31
4:31this is from the Elite Collection which is amazeballz now I'm going to conceal
4:35my under eye area
4:37I skip this part pretty quickly because I feel like you guys have seen me do
4:39this whole entire drill five thousand times and if you ever want updated
4:43foundation or concealer routine you know just to ask and I shall give it to you
4:47so i am just going ahead and using a damp beauty blender to blend out the
4:51Urban Decay waitlist naked concealer up towards the temple then I always take it
4:56and I put it on my chin around my nose because women can always get red there
5:00that's just due to hormones
5:01you can't escape it and then in the center of the forehead as well just to
5:05even out that very light highlight that we're doing and then also just to make
5:08things look a little bit more natural when you do consider aren't the eyes and
5:12even out other place to the face
5:14in the end it will just make everything look a little bit more put together now
5:17i'm going to set that highlight using my two favorite under I highlighting
5:21powders
5:22I am mixing both mac pro emphasize which is a pro product but you can still find
5:25out on mac cosmetics calm and anastacio banana powder which you can find
5:30separately or it comes in her contour kit the original one as well so i'm
5:34going to set the entire under eye area and also the eyelid because that will
5:37help prep our eyes for eyeshadow also the chin and the center of the forehead
5:41so that nothing moves or creases in it last all day long
5:44now we're going to go in with the eyes i'm going to be using the Kat Von D
5:48shade light eye palette can we please just admire this palette oh my god
5:52we're starting off with that matte grey shade which by the way this entire
5:55palette is Matt which is just amazing i love it when people do all mats or all
5:59summer palace I just think it's so fun
6:01so going on with that gray shade in the sigma e40 i'm going to only put this on
6:05the outer corner of the eye as you can see i'm going to do something that's
6:08gonna make a lot of people nervous and that isn't going to wrap this color
6:11completely around the eye as you can see i'm not separating the shades going in
6:16now with makeup geek barcelona beach
6:18this is not completely necessary but i love this color and just adding more
6:22and more graze on top of grey's is just going to give such a three-dimensional
6:26look and in the end it's just gonna look so smoky and so blown out i feel like
6:30the more colors i use the more seamless my eyes look so I am now using a more
6:34fee and 503 blending brush and again i'm going to put that mainly in the outer
6:38corner of the eye all over that lid area
6:40I'm going to wrap it around you really want to halo and circle that entire I I
6:45know it can be intimidating to do this because you're like wait a second i'm
6:48about to have a black eye
6:49but just do it and I'm telling you the end result is so beautiful so using this
6:53kind of like chocolatey gray color it's really interesting because its color
6:57isn't like a deep gray but it's also not a deep brown it's like a chocolaty great
7:00and it's beautiful
7:01i'm going to be using an e 22 brush my morphe and i'm going to again
7:05pack this on that outer corner I love this brush because it has a little bit
7:08of a tip
7:09so you can really get precise with it which is why I'm going on with this
7:12blending brush right now
7:13once you are done with that you're going to want to go in with a fluffy brush
7:16like the sigma e40 and just go back and forth and blend blend blend that is
7:21what's going to make this look beautiful and not look like you got punched in the
7:23face is blending so be patient and take your time i'm going in with laura
7:27mercier translucent powder and I'm going to pack that on my cheekbones come about
7:31to go in with a very intense black and I just do that that way it will catch the
7:34fall out and not get all over my face Andrew my foundation
7:37so now going in with that black from the palette and a sigma e25 I'm not just
7:41going to begin to do the same thing with this that I do with those other shades
7:44and yes Frankie was whining at my feet that's why I'm holding him here for a
7:47quick second but I'm about to put him down
7:49so I'm going to pack that on the entire outer corner but i'm also going to make
7:53sure that i am not going above my crease we're going to keep this a little bit
7:57lower than the gray colors because we don't want to go extended too high
8:01otherwise once again that can kind of make you look like a panda bear and kind
8:05of like you've been bruised
8:06the trick is to keep the black as low as possible and that the grades go up
8:09higher so keep the black low and make sure that you blend blend blend and
8:14those two things combined are going to make it so it's your smoky eye is
8:17beautiful and not too scary and not too harsh and jagged where it can look like
8:21whoa what did you do to your face because you know exactly I'm talking
8:24about
8:24we've all had that problem smokey eyes before so again with the black i'm
8:27wrapping it around the eye and again blending it out just make sure that you
8:32really take your time
8:33talk on this black very intensely and halo around the entire corner of your
8:37eye to really make it blown out and smoky
8:40now I'm going to line my waterline using using ardency Inn eyeliner
8:44this is the creamiest kinkiest blackest liner i've ever used and it does not
8:47leave my waterline all day long
8:50i'm using the e 18 pencil brush from the elite collection and all that causes
8:54pencil brush is amazing just to pack on a little bit more black
8:58now i'm going with a mac - 28 brush and this is the teeth tiniest little
9:01precision brush you've ever seen and i use this to highlight my inner corner
9:05i am currently using math shroom eyeshadow I'm sorry I didn't show you
9:08the camera show the camera the product but I was just so my zone you know how
9:12it is
9:13I'm going to pack that on really intensely on the inner corner of my eye
9:16cause I wanted to be a very very bright in our corner I mean you can go is
9:20bright white as you want and I don't think it's really going to be 2 over
9:22boards it really works since you have such a dark outer corner have a really
9:26intense bright inner corner that exact same shroom color by mac i'm going to
9:31use that all my brow bone just to highlight this to me is so necessary
9:34when you're doing like an intense smoky eye
9:37highlighting the brow bone is just going to complete that bombshell look
9:41now i'm going in with a mac pressed pigment you guys know I'm such a fan of
9:44mac press pigments I think they're gorgeous
9:46when im using the shade in lightning and i'm going to just pack that on the lid
9:49using my finger you can choose to use glitter glue it will make this easier i
9:53am using a paper towel so I don't get too much fallout because you will have
9:57fallout with the mat press pigments you really can't escape it when you're
10:01applying it unless you use glitter glue
10:02I'm gonna pop on some false lashes these are by it flutters eyelashes i'm not
10:06sure what Sally are you guys I'm so sorry i've used them like 15 times it's
10:10just like one of those things they've been sitting on my vanity I keep popping
10:12them on sanitary I know
10:14moving on now i'm going to contour my face i am using the NARS either brush
10:19I've been obsessed with this again you guys my tried-and-true died was so
10:22obsessed with his back in the day and it is back in business and i'm going to
10:25just cut my face using the too faced chocolate soleil bronzer and then I'm
10:30just of course going to even that out by bronzing my forehead as well I'm going
10:34to go in with becca sweet pea blush using a more feet e3 is this notice it
10:39before I'm sorry sweet P blushes my go-to blush and I'm doing smokey eyes
10:43because it gives just enough color to the skin but it's very neutral and it's
10:46not over
10:46the top on the cheeks now to highlight i'm going to use mary-lou manizer by the
10:51bomb
10:51it's such a beautiful neutral very vanilla shade i love love love this
10:55highlight when I'm not doing something to bronzy because it's so vanilla it
10:59just complements your eyes so incredibly well now different just look off i'm
11:03going to be using dose of colors stone liquid lipstick i believe this is a
11:07liquid lipstick but i will link it down below for you guys if you're curious and

0:57does not have a mirror and which i don't
1:00
1:00care i get ready in my studio or on a

5:01now i don't know if i'm going to wet the
5:02
5:02brush with 6 plus yet it might not need

5:04it so I'm just going to go in here a few
5:07
5:07times
5:08
5:08oh ok ok might not need any fucking girl
5:11
5:11and I'm just going to do packing motions
5:14
5:14and go on my lashline blue right now I'm
5:18
5:18gonna merge Dubai with the other colors
5:21
5:21and we're just gonna pack this in and of
5:23
5:23course we're going to blend it it out
5:25
5:25better later but we're going to lay down
5:26
5:26the foundation of our left
5:28
5:28all right now a lot of the times with
5:30
5:30these colors there's a lot of fallout
5:32
5:32because of just a shade in the pigment
5:34
5:34but this is pretty good you guys my
5:36
5:36cheeks are not dusted and I'm just
5:38
5:38packing this in a really heavy and bam
5:41
5:41all right
5:41
5:41the lids are looking rusty and i love it
5:44
5:44now I'm gonna be going in with this deep
5:46
5:46topaz bronze color it's called la yes
5:50
5:50shut up to calabasas what's up Los
5:52
5:52Angeles i love the shade name ok so I'm
5:55
5:55going to be taking this guy and taking
5:57
5:57it all the way down to here and just
5:59
5:59kind of give
6:00
6:00get a little moment to just you know
6:02
6:02blind fucking my life so I'm gonna be
6:05
6:05using this little shader brush and
6:07
6:07sometimes i like to wet the brush to
6:09
6:09really intensify metallics but ok let's
6:14
6:14see what happens with this guy
6:19
6:19now this one feels really creamy already
6:21
6:21on the brush I haven't touched it with
6:23
6:23my finger but it feels really nice and
6:26
6:26it's blending into the other shadows um
6:28
6:28pretty great
6:30
6:30alright now we're going to go in with
6:31
6:31the bottom right shape this one is
6:32
6:32called almond it is a dark chocolate
6:34
6:34brown with a warm undertone and I'm
6:37
6:37gonna be going in with that same mac 221
6:39
6:39brush now I love these because the last
6:42
6:42one had a lot of kickback and was a
6:44
6:44little more powdery this one I think is
6:46
6:46a little more fine-tuned and the formula
6:47
6:48i think already just from playing with
6:50
6:50them is slightly better i think the last
6:52
6:52pilot was still fine and you know
6:54
6:54there's so many mixed reviews people are
6:55
6:55just crazy in general I think a lot of
6:57
6:57people seek out and want to hate
6:58
6:58something but so far so good and I'm
7:01
7:01loving how these are blending so I'm
7:03
7:03gonna take that shade almond and we're
7:05
7:05just going to lightly place it in the
7:08
7:08outer crease area just to darken my eye
7:11
7:11socket and give it some fall drop now
7:15
7:15I'm gonna be taking that same Bobby
7:16
7:16Brown blending brush and we're gonna go
7:18
7:18back into beach just ever so slightly
7:20
7:20and now we're just going to go over what
7:23
7:23we did earlier and just gonna drag it
7:25
7:25and blend it out just so it's a little
7:27
7:27more soft and dramatic soft dramatic
7:31
7:31work together is that that term I think
7:33
7:33so
7:33
7:33all right now I think I want to smoke up
7:34
7:34my entire bottom lashes with the middle
7:36
7:36shade and burgundy I think this is the
7:38
7:38start of the palette if you will
7:40
7:40I'm just going to be going in with the
7:42
7:42Tom Ford little pencil brush and I'm
7:44
7:44going to do liner in a second but I just
7:46
7:46kind of want to smoke this out and see
7:47
7:47how it looks
7:48
7:48I'm just gonna really gently drag it
7:51
7:51across my entire under I'm just trying
7:54
7:54to smoke this bitch out
7:56
7:56oh wow this is like really creamy like
7:59
7:59when I say smooth glide on
8:03
8:03I'm shockingly enough just because I've
8:05
8:05had bad experiences with other brands
8:06
8:06usually has a lot of red fallout but
8:08
8:08this one you know and I am clicking the
8:10
8:10brush but it's pretty good
8:12
8:12we're gonna go back with this guy and
8:14
8:14dip into that almond shade and was going
8:16
8:16to kind of blend them together and let
8:18
8:18them merge there now having a baby or
8:21

8:31
8:31contact lenses today to give it a little
8:33
8:33extra ryan right there
8:35
8:35I think my brown eyes definitely could
8:38
8:38have worked but I just kind of wanted
8:39
8:39extra little you know this little
8:41
8:41pizzazz if you will right now for the
8:43
8:43last time we're gonna be dipping into

8:53
8:53know a lot of people are like me i just
8:55

8:58
8:58smoky eyes so I'm just gonna drag out
9:00
9:00the colors and bam all right now for the
9:04
9:04waterline i'm gonna be using this little
9:05
9:05Smith 202 brush look I'm tiny that is
9:08
9:08I'm like girl and I'm going to be using
9:10
9:10the tart black clay pot liner was going
9:14
9:14to be dipping into this ever so slightly
9:16
9:16it is a really creamy and really
9:17
9:17pigmented just how i like it and I'm
9:20
9:20gonna be taking a little beauty blender
9:21
9:21to hold down my eye and we're just going
9:24
9:24to tuck this in our water line
9:30
9:30alright BAM liner is done i usually i
9:33
9:33love to take a pencil liner and really
9:36
9:36make it so dramatic on the bottom but I
9:37
9:37want this red burgundy color to just a
9:40
9:40live and breathe and I because i love
9:43
9:43how it looks now I definitely think
9:44
9:44there needs to be some shimmer or
9:46
9:46something else below the brow so I'm
9:48
9:48gonna be trying this top sheet it's
9:51
9:51called naked
9:52
9:52it is a shimmery it looks almost like a
9:54
9:54beige type of color so hopefully it's
9:56
9:56not too dark for my skin tone but I just
9:58
9:58kind of wanted to add a little bit below
10:00
10:00the brow just for a little shimmer now
10:03
10:03i'm so used to putting like stark white
10:05
10:05colors below the brow that actually
10:07
10:07don't mind this it looks cool i'm only
10:10
10:10doing it from here i'm not gonna take it
10:11
10:11all the way in I just started from right
10:13
10:13here i'm just going to blend and merge
10:15
10:15those colors together all right now i
10:17
10:17think i'm gonna have to go in with this
10:18
10:18guy again and i'm just gonna buff and
10:21
10:21make those colors seamless this is
10:23
10:23coming together nicely you guys im
10:26
10:26feeling the fall fantasy
10:28
10:28alright i think the only thing missing
10:29
10:29is of course the lashes so I'm going to
10:31
10:31start by applying my benefit roller
10:33
10:33mascara roller lash if you will

10:37now this has been my tried-and-true for
10:38
10:38a long time and let's get to it

10:49all right now before I apply lashes yeah
10:52
10:52we gotta go old-school jeffree star and
10:54
10:54I think it's time to hit the roast court

11:01
11:01all right now for lashes i'm gonna be
11:04

12:45final thoughts this palette is great i
12:48
12:48know so many people are gonna want to
12:50
12:50hate and be crazy and I know there's so
12:52
12:52many of you that love Kylie and you're
12:54
12:54like yes another amazing product from
12:56
12:56her so this video is of course just my
12:58
12:58experiences it blended amazing the
13:01
13:01formula was great i think the only
13:03
13:03shadow I wasn't obsessed with was the
13:06
13:06far top one it is a little more sheer
13:09
13:09than the rest but I remember Kylie
13:12
13:12saying that on snapchat she wanted to be
13:14
13:14a little more subdued so it's not a
13:15
13:15negative it's just personally I like
13:17
13:17really rich pigments think that she
13:19
13:19really improved the formula from the
13:20
13:20last palette even though i was a fan of
13:22
13:22that one I think that this one is better
13:24
13:24and that's just my opinion
13:26
13:26so I think it's awesome that she is
13:27
13:27improving the formulas and working on
13:29
13:29everything and definitely going to be
13:30
13:30using this and i love that it's you know
13:32
13:32perfect for travel it's a cute little
13:33

13:35

6:07real quickly i'm gonna draw on browse
6:09off-camera and I'll be right back and
6:11now that the brows are on and they're a
6:13little more higher-than-normal Ohio
6:15consume a little beauty mark
6:16hi all right we're gonna prime in these
6:19lids with a little Mac painterly I'm
6:22just gonna go over my entire lid and up
6:25to my brow bone all right now I'm really
6:28excited for today's look because i'm
6:29going to be using the hood of beauty a
6:31rose gold eyeshadow palette now I know a
6:34lot of youtubers have used this and
6:36there has been as so many mixed reviews
6:39now I think from already using this
6:41off-camera for a few looks I understand
6:44some people's concerns about the top row
6:47now these are textured shadows on the
6:50box even says best applied with your
6:53fingers now when you have really long
6:55nails like me could be a little more
6:56tricky but that's what the pinkies for
6:58now I've noticed that if you really
6:59wanted the foil shadows to be a really
7:01highly pigmented on your lid it is easy
7:03to just go on with your finger and like
7:05Pat it on and it is a blinding with a
7:08brush it could be a little bit tricky so
7:10I'm just gonna do something a little
7:11cute and fun today and i'm going to
7:14start by going in with shade saddlewood
7:16which is this one all the way down here
7:18and we use a little shadow blending
7:22brush and we're just gonna pop this in
7:24our crease for our transition shade and
7:27lets blend
7:32now with another eyeshadow blending
7:35brush I'm going to take shade henna
7:37which is this one all right there and
7:39we're also going to put that in the
7:40crease and add a little bit more in
7:42jarama to the lid if you will
7:49all right now that is a blended and I'm
7:52gonna take one of those foiled shades
7:54this one is called a rose gold now it
7:57says to just use your fingers somebody's
8:00my pinky it is the skinniest nail home
8:03that I have now when you use this with
8:05your finger like that is full pigment
8:08someone's going to take this and oh ok
8:12ok now let me try to blend that with my
8:15finger it's really hard because my nails
8:17in the way so what I'm hoping is I can
8:21blend that in with a little synthetic
8:24bristle brush now here's the thing when
8:26you go in with a brush
8:28kinda shows but not as pigmented as the
8:31finger whatsoever so I'm just gonna try
8:33to go in and blend that up
8:36this is my favorite formula know if I
8:38had no nails would be a lot easier
8:40yes hundred percent now i am going to
8:43take a little detailing brush from Mac
8:46and we're going to dip into shade cocoa
8:48which is this beautiful chocolate-brown
8:51and I'm just gonna finesse a little bit
8:53into my crease and make it even deeper
8:55and our call and we're gonna go back in
9:00to saddlewood
9:04now i'm going to smoke out the last line
9:06with bossy and then a little bit of
9:08flamingos and let's try to mix and see
9:10what we can come up with a fine I'm just
9:19gonna try this pink shade called
9:22flamingo and let's see if she wants to
9:24work now I'm just going to put this in
9:26my chair duct and blend in I know it's a
9:28little weird placement but hey I'm a
9:30fucking weirdo
9:32alright guys i am now taking a bossy and
9:38flamingo and yet i'm mixing them
9:40together and I'm creating a little kind
9:42of like smoky grungy dirty like fucked
9:46up kinda I I mean you know only the best
9:49kind and I'm just blending these
9:51together and really bringing it down so
9:53the drama is a real to you all right i
9:56definitely think I need a little bit of
9:58black and my waterline so I'm gonna take
9:59my trusty max moulder eye pencil and

0:35today I'm gonna be showing you how to get this kind of like Barbie doll asked
0:39little cut crease full glam a moment with bitchy winged liner and a really
0:45bright lip and of course highlight highlight highlighted everywhere
0:51so if you want to see how I did the full foundation and the doing is click the
0:55video before this one
0:57and if you want to see how I completed the look then keep on watching
1:01alright so before we get started on the full makeup
1:05Oh Betty the brows first
1:22browser on now let's get started with this look to get this smoky cut crease
1:27little type of Barbie moment that we are trying to achieve today i am going to be
1:32using my Kat Von D shade + light eye palette now we're basically going to use
1:36all shadows from his palate today
1:39I love this it's perfect as every new trade you could possibly want for a
1:42quick little easy look nothing is quick and easy about this look but you know
1:47the drill so we are going to take a little flat blending brush my trusty mac
1:52to 52 as usual and we're going to be dipping into this white color right here
1:57these are really pigmented so you don't need to use a lot and I am just going to
2:02Pat this under my in tire brow bone
2:08and we're going to let that sit for a minute we're almost going to be baking
2:12under the brows
2:13if you will now if you notice how i'm doing his little patting motions and
2:17basically pressing the powder into my skin that is going to be like the best
2:22way to get that brow highlight to never come off during the entire day we got
2:27that Urban Decay eyeshadow primer in shade and nygma
2:31and this is the quantity it's like a neutral nude Matt type of base
2:35so I'm just going to whip it out and apply now I like this because it's a
2:39really neutral look so my lids have any darkness or redness gets canceled that
2:45which is nice going to use the same brush and dab that primer all over the
2:51lid there we go
2:52cool so now the lids are primed and i'm going to go back in with that white
2:59shade again and put this on top of the primer so it's like really going to
3:03stand out
3:04oh yes now a key essential part of this look is giving your lids a lot of space
3:09so I'm going to take this and already I'm going to drag it all the way down
3:13let me turn my face a little and we're going to bring this all the way in there
3:17right there and that is going to be blank
3:21during this entire look and then we'll drag out the white and will bring it all
3:24the way out
3:25all right now it's time to start creating our wing
3:29all right now let's start carving out that socket now I'm going to mind a
3:32little higher than normal because i want to create a really big dramatic type of
3:37like smoky wing
3:38so I'm gonna be taking this morphy 514 brush
3:41I love this little detailer and we're going to be dipping into this like
3:45reddish just like a warm tone brown as like a red base to it I
3:50love this guy and we're just going to coat our entire bristles with this so
3:55I'm gonna go a little higher than normal and i'm going to sketch out my own lid
4:01which is going to be really delicate so you don't wanna go to heavy hand you
4:06want to be really light with this one and I'm going to bring that all the way
4:09and you want to create a really dramatic effect today so I'll start to soften it
4:15and you can see how I'm bringing it already down here
4:19so you're going to be really careful and then i'm going to start flicking my
4:22wrist and dragging this up a little bit so it gives it the evolution of it are
4:26being blended out
4:27I'm gonna follow and go down a little bit and out almost like a little i'm
4:32going to drag it all the way to my
4:34I brown and that's how we start and build out our socket
4:38now to get the upper part really airbrush I'm just gonna take a blending
4:42brush and I'm going to be using this transition color right here and I'm
4:45going to be mixing it back in with that Brown
4:48so we get a really nice airbrush effect for the Rockets I'm just going to go
4:54over what i did a little bit and just start dragging up so it's really nice
5:00and soft and then you can go on with your blending brush and I love to just
5:04dab right back in that really white one and we're just going to take it under
5:08the eye and we're just gonna drag it out like so so it's really carve and
5:14interaction going to go back and you guys and go
5:16just on the top again so we really soften those lines look has a lot of
5:22back and forth
5:23now it's time for a black winged liner
5:26you guys ready for that I don't even know if I'm ready for that so to get
5:30inspired for this crazy liner
5:33who if you only had like a bag of chips and a red bull today and you've just
5:36been filming and haven't had time to eat
5:37thank God for medical marijuana let's get started
5:43alright so for today's bitchy Conte winged liner i'm going to be using the
5:46YSL babydoll liner in black
5:49now I love the sky because the red sole on the end
5:52oh it is so thin you see that like tiny to accentuate the wing and fill in any
5:58missing little spots that the liquid is not do i'm going to be using the tart
6:02clay pot black liner
6:04this stuff is magic i love this i can wear makeup for 10 hours of my wing is
6:10still the leaky and now i'm going to shut my mouth
6:13hold my breath and get to winning
6:15yeah
6:22all right now that my liner is done I am ready to finish this look
6:27now if your liner does not look like it's ready to apply to be a guillotine
6:31you better go over it some more strange thing all right let's finish this we're
6:36going to go back to this little blending brush and we're just gonna jump right in
6:40there with a little bit of this one and we're just going to go right under the
6:44eyes and be really soft and we're just gonna go back and forth really lightly
6:50and start to create a little smokiness and you have got to take it all the way
6:54in because we are going to add some glitter in a second and then I'm going
6:58to bring it to where the wing starts now the bottom should be really smoked out
7:03now we're going to really accentuate the eyes and do some white doll like liner
7:09in the water line
7:10so if you really want to look plastic and artificial i mean hi that was my
7:14goal since birth
7:15you are just going to get some white liner of your choice and we're just
7:19gonna pop that into the water line and I'm going to really going on
7:23- and even put it right under there and then we're going to drag the liner all
7:28the way across and i'm going back and forth several times
7:32so the color is poppin and then we're going to take the liner and we're just
7:36gonna bring it down a little
7:38hello eyes now if you don't look like an alien sex doll
7:42you got you some more ok so now that the liner is dying
7:46I think I need a little bit of glitter you guys know you don't have to look for

11:47lid and then we're going to put the baby pink in the center
11:56all right now we're just gonna put Queen supreme in the center
11:59i'm actually going to use a little I shadow brush to help ombre and blend
12:03that out and an easy little solution is to use your middle finger and just kind
12:11of blend in any harsh lines and then for a little more definition i like to go in
12:16with that hot pink color one more time on that brush just get a little bit of
12:20product and then you can kind of adding a little bit more darkness
12:24all right the lips are dry now i know i said lips was the last thing and if you

13:36blue green or yellow
13:37so recreate this look if you want give it a whirl it took a little bit of time
13:42a lot of patience and a lot of marijuana but we got the right now I have a
13:45question for you guys since four twenties approaching should be innate do
13:49a Q&A part two is that is the time i mean 420 is approaching so I feel like
13:55should we do want to leave a comment down below and let me know if we should
13:58do one
13:59thank you so much for watching I will see you on the next one
0:09hello everyone welcome back to my channel
0:15now when i asked you guys what kind of videos you want to see next
0:18I got an overwhelming amount of response to do a full drugstore makeup tutorial
0:24now I know you shady bitch is that I would never do it but come on if your
0:28makeup artist you can make anything work
0:30not that drugstore makeup is bad it's just have a lot of tendencies to be more
0:35misses than hit from my previous experiences um
0:39and now that I make makeup I know formula so this was a really interesting
0:43experiment and I just want to make a disclaimer that some of the makeup
0:47brushes are from my personal collection from other brands that are not drug
0:52store but every makeup products used in this video is drugstore pot so if you
0:57want to see how i created all this
0:59keep watching and see what happens alright so the first thing I'm going to
1:04do is take this lip smackers dr pepper flavor lip balm and I'm my lips
1:12now your face primer i was looking through all the aisles and I like el
1:16pibe you some of this stuff before i've never used this hydrating face primer
1:21before so we're going to try it out
1:23I'm not really sure how much you're supposed to use i'm just going to use a
1:26nice little bull is very bad fying i will let that dry down for a second it
1:32now you guys know the first thing I always do is put on a lot of foundation
1:37so I Instagram that i was going to be doing this video and you guys gave me so
1:42many options and advice on what to buy and the product that kept standing out
1:49was the lower yell and fallible Pro matte foundation
1:53everyone is like this is amazing everyone's raving about it so I'm going
1:58to go in with shade 102 shell page
2:02let's pray to Jesus and matches I'm just going to take this with a real
2:07techniques blush
2:08this is number three hundred you guys know I love to . it all around my face
2:13before I blend it out
2:15now I've never used any of these products
2:18for so let's see how they work
2:22ok I think that let me start bumping this in now using new foundations can
2:33break you out it doesn't matter if they are high end or not changing your
2:37routine just freaks your skin or in general
2:40so I need you guys to all pause this video and say a silent prayer for my
2:44face and as always we're going to blend to the neck avoiding all the tattoo
2:51foods and you guys know I have to dab that year think that's good enough
2:56coverage for me we'll see what happens
2:58before i do a lot of powder i'm definitely going to conceal
3:02now if you watched my previous videos you guys know I'm really not a fan of
3:05concealer but this foundation is just not as heavy as I normally would wear it
3:11I'm definitely going to conceal and I got this Maybelline better skin
3:17camouflage concealer
3:19let's try this out this is shade ivory
3:24alright this bunch is damp let's start blending out this sponge is really hard
3:34like it's actually taking off my foundation
3:41so you see that my foundation is like missing right there
3:46ok we're not going to use that let's go back to the brush i'm just going to use
3:52the same foundation brush and try to pump out some of this concealer before
3:57it's too late
3:59ok much better I'm like Jesus
4:02now the cool thing about this concealer is it's not making any fine lines like
4:08more noticeable it's actually concealing and doing an amazing job
4:13come thru concealer now sometimes i do cream contour sometimes they don't we're
4:19going we're going to just do patters today
4:21now I want a full mass of coverage so I thought
4:25loreal infallible Pro matte powder foundation and i'm going to dust this
4:30over my entire face
4:33come through Matt I'm Matt powder
4:41now that doesn't have much color to it which is what I wanted but it does leave
4:45a really nice matte finish and this shade was 104 Celyn you know I have a
4:51fair pitch now the really wasn't a lot of highlight and contour kit at the
4:58drugstore
4:59I did find this really joke when from Maybelline it's called the master
5:02contour palette just three shades it's contour blush highlight I think that
5:06contour color is perfect for my skin tone so we're going to try that today
5:10and I also found this big bronzing powder it's from prestige cosmetics
5:15so i am going to onto our first i'm going to be using this miss cosmetics
5:19brush my fav you contour brush I'm going to dip into the contour and was painted
5:25ok ok let's try it out
5:30now we're gonna go down here and we're going to carve our face out of stone
5:36now for the forehead i'm going to be going in with this estee lauder bronzing
5:39brush and we're going to dip into that prestige cosmetics
5:43let's see how going to do
5:46oh my god this has shimmer to it mother fucker
5:51ok so my dumbass didn't realize that that goal being up there as a shimmer
5:56let's wipe off the gold bronzing Stardust powder off my forehead
6:01ok I think we're getting there i might have a small halo but uh it's ok it's
6:07preparing me to go to have it now to soften that we're just going to use the
6:11same brush and get back into that powder
6:15ok we're we're pretty going toward I'm feeling it
6:18all right now contouring the nose a little scary so I'm gonna be using the
6:22Oval three brush from artiste how I dip in this once
6:25you don't need a ton of product unless you want that
6:29all right and i'm going to cap the end of it now for a highlight
6:34there is a highlight in here which I'm going to watch it with my finger
6:38they had no idea if it's gonna work or not pretty now i'm just going to grab a
6:42more p310 fan brush
6:46I love this thing have someone there and let's see if I'm going to be going
6:52it's subtle it's cute
6:56I'm noticing that this actually has a little bit of color with it to add some
7:01little shimmer about the Browns i'm about to draw on
7:04ok actually pretty cute more layering the more shine i'm seeing on my
7:09cheekbones
7:10all right for brows today I tried to find something comparable to the honest
7:14Ostia shade toe and i found two things this Maybelline brow defined and Phil
7:20duo
7:21I think will match of course it's hard to tell when you look at a unit carton
7:25and you can't swatch it so i got this and then also l'oreal has a ground
7:29stylist which had a brow powder in it
7:32how powder was hard to find at the drugstore so maybe using this guy
7:35obviously I don't need this wax because i have no grau hairs so we're just gonna
7:39dip it is powder and try to draw on with this
7:47ok now that I got the shape down i'm going to go in with this mac eyebrow
7:53angled brush and dip into this lowering l
8:01all right I decided on a topi gold glitter soft neutral eye and i am going
8:10to be using the lower la palette nude one of the lightest shade is probably my
8:16color right there so I'm gonna be using this and I'm gonna use my go-to Mac 252
8:23brush and just apply this over the entire eye area definitely messy a lot
8:30of fallout
8:31you guys know I did you fall out now this position formula
8:36these are all like shimmer shades and this top one is like it's really pretty
8:40as like a glitter to it
8:42so I'm going to dip into this guy right here and I'm just going to put this
8:47right under the brow bone
8:51oh let's go in with this L contour brush now I'm assuming this is for the eyes
9:00not the cheeks and i'm going to go to this wet and wild palette this is that
9:04I'm getting sunburned eyeshadow palette and I'm gonna hit this crease color
9:11ok I'm just going to put this in my crease it was dark and i'm going to
9:18leave some space below and put gold where there is no color yet so bear with
9:23me
9:26ok now i'm gonna pop this out and i'm actually gonna do this
9:33taupe shade right here and go over that and stop in the line with my Makka 224
9:39brush and drag the shadow down a little bit
9:49take this brush again and go back in with the light color and right below the
9:54shimmers going to blend this out a little bit
9:56there we go now i'm going to go in with this one second Toby shimmery color and
10:05add in a little bit more dimension to my lid
10:09before i do anything with the under i'm going to add some shimmer and i found
10:13this press glitter pigment from wet n wild gonna use my finger I know that
10:19sounds very strange coming from me but sometimes the fingers are the best
10:27good morning goal thank you for joining my lid really pretty
10:31now that sounds like a sticky consistency to it which is making it
10:34stick to my lid really good
10:37all right now I'm going to take a more p 5 11 brush and really get in the inner
10:43corner which I could not do with my fingers and then i'm going to go back
10:47over with this and really press it
10:51yes now i'm going to take some of this and just put it in my inner corner below
10:56now for under the eye
10:59I'm going to take this myth cosmetics - 20 brush and I'm just gonna take this
11:06color here just love it on dirt now I wanted to try some sort of eyeliner so I
11:20got this
11:21revlon eye pencil and i'm going to put it in my waterline and see what happens
11:27all right now with the morphe 514 brush I'm going to go back in with that same
11:36brown shade that we just did under the eye and I'm just going to bump it out
11:40starting the center of my eye and go outwards and smoke it out a little bit
11:45more
11:48all right now i'm going to go back in with this shade a little bit on the
11:54outside and blend it with my Mac blending brush and kind of merge these
12:00two together now to me these eyeshadows blend a little patchy
12:06it's old it's kind of frustrating having to go back and forth so many times which
12:11is not normal for me but i think i got the eyes where I want them
12:16I was talking to my grandma about doing this video and she goes if you don't use
12:19the famous pink Maybelline mascara I'm going to slap you upside your head
12:24if you've never heard of this mascara you must be under an igloo in Antarctica
12:29because this has been around before any of us were born right for lashes i know
12:37this is a drugstore makeup tutorial but i got these at the costume store and
12:42they were 89 cents so I definitely think this will qualify
12:46now these are really big and dramatic not that you're shocked at all
12:49it's gonna float away too quick of Jesus
12:56now i'm going with the tweezers and I'm trusting my real lashes with the false
13:00ones
13:01all right second latches on last but not least is the lips
13:05now that was a hard one for me I just want something really bright
13:09coralie and fun so I found
13:11this Revlon brand it is a liquid to matte but it's not long-lasting like
13:17mine
13:18so this shade is called temptation forces
13:23Wow look like a cake candle
13:27now it's still wet looking looks like a lip gloss but it says it is ultra HD
13:37matte lip color
13:39so let's give this a second and see if it is going to dry down
13:44all right so it's been about five minutes off camera and this still hasn't
13:48dried down
13:49I don't know if it's supposed to drive all the way matt it says Matt and Matt
13:53Matt as you can see it looks like a lip gloss to me it's like slowly getting
13:57there but it's still really shiny
13:59I love the lip color I don't mind a gloss it's just not doing what it says
14:03so now last but not least I was like oh my God if I can't use my Urban Decay all
14:09nighter what the fuck am I gonna do
14:12and i found this Maybelline it's basically like a fixed plus but it's
14:16called master fix
14:18so let's see what happened ok let that settle
14:25alright guys that was that full drug store
14:28look as you can see some of the products were really amazing i kind of want to
14:32scrape office gold glitter and register as the video progressed the foundation
14:38did not sit on my skin
14:40how I wanted to I maybe it was the primer maybe I don't know no one knows
14:44but um I love the look I think it's really fun it was a little challenging
14:48for me in the sense that i have never used these products before not that I
14:52was afraid she's drugstore makeup but I just prefer higher-end products because
14:57the formulas tend to be top notch where some of the stuff i was really hard to
15:02do so i hope you enjoy watching this and i'll see you next time bye guys
0:00what's up guys welcome to my Channel today we're going to be doing a really
0:11dark dramatic sultry look with metallic glow and sneak peek at a new product so

3:26and we're just going to lightly pull this down and put some liner in the
3:31water line i'm going to drag this liner a little below the lash line so i can
3:37smoke it out and use it as my second blending tool

0:52all right now back to make up today I'm doing a little fun
0:55warm tone sunset it's not smoky it's not a wing it's like an in-between smoky
1:00wing so saddle up
1:02get your brush is ready and enjoy this look today I did my normal face routine
1:07if you want to see how I did the base of the brows you can look through my
1:10channel and find that gym but today we're going to do a cat eye
1:15I'm gonna start by priming my lids oh my god Geoffrey finding the lid I know it
1:20happens once in a while especially for these extreme glamour looks and I'm
1:24gonna go in with the YSL couture
1:27I primer i love this one if you want to use the Mac painterly that everyone else
1:31uses please use that i personally can't buy mine
1:36so we will be using this today and i'm just applying this with a little mac 217
1:40brush and I'm just going to coat my entire lids and I'm gonna bring it up
1:46almost to the brow bone drive and have a brow bone if you don't have a brownie i
1:50guess if you my whole forehead is the brow bone
1:53it's almost like matched my skin tone that's crazy and then I'm going to put
1:56some under my eyes
1:57- just a little bit just a little hair all right now today we're going to do
2:02something that I normally don't do
2:05we're going to use the scotch tape for that wing
2:08when you do a lot of eyeshadows anyone to get that extreme cut look
2:12scotch tape is the easiest way to go now a lot of you're going to like what i
2:17mean about that over your foundation
2:19I definitely a.m. I'm just going to put on a really light and soft so it doesn't
2:24really disrupt it and if it rips it off will just apply more later
2:27so what you want to do is just for your tear ducts are you want to follow your
2:30natural eye line and just go up so I'm just gonna follow that natural line and
2:38being on
2:40she scotch probably the most common question is well how do you get this
2:44side to match its honestly like drawing on the Browse you just got to eyeball it
2:48all right now that the eyes are taped it's time to do the eye shadow
2:52now i'm going to use a new palette today that I've never tried this is the new
2:55violet
2:56Baz Holy Grail I shadow palette
2:59now when I saw these colors i was like who
3:03bitch this paula is sickening I am loving these read that goal off
3:11I think right away i am going to dip into this color called hashed ad and i'm
3:17going to be using my Mac 224 brush is going to be like my transition color and
3:22let's see how well the shadows blend
3:25I'm just gonna go right in my crease I'm actually not going to go all the way you
3:30guys know I love to go all the way to my brow bone into the nose
3:34today we're going to stop that because I we're doing something do for it
3:40sorry dick in my throat and i'm just going to follow my natural brow bone
3:45all right now I'm going to take the brush and go all the way to where that
3:50tape is and then brush out now
3:53course foremost to be they do not have a face tattoo you you can drag it out even
3:57more if you want
3:58I'm just going to go past the brow for like a really dramatic effect
4:04all right now normally i do a really light eyeshadow at the top which i'm
4:11going to just do now and i'm going to take the shade called thanks a latte
4:16which is a really nice cream nude color without shimmer
4:21and i'm just going to take my mac to buy to brush and just take it from the start
4:26of the brow and buff it all the way across this is really going to help me
4:31get that amazing soft finish and make sure it's all blended and then I'm just
4:36going back with that brush with no extra product from the softening that
4:41transition color even more now let's add in some darkness
4:47all right i'm gonna take this mac 217 brush and I'm going to dip into that
4:50wine color
4:52oh so pretty high i'm going to create some really dramatic depth so let me
4:58just take this brush and I'm going to actually put it on my lid but not all
5:04the way just a little bit
5:06well halfway there notice how I'm not going all the way in
5:10I'm just keeping it what what is this like a sixty percent and then we're
5:14going to drag this as well and the throw that tape really comes in handy because
5:18it's going to stop all that crazy fall out and it's going to create a beautiful
5:22line now how we're going to make this color blend amazing we're going to go
5:26back in with that same blending brush from earlier
5:30I like to go back and forth and back and forth a lot so we're going to get tipped
5:34back into hash tag and then we're just going to blend and blend before I add in
5:38any more darkness
5:40I want to do a pop of color in here and I keep staring at this color called
5:45toffee it's like this gold color I'm like mesmerized by it so let me dip in
5:50with my little mac - 13 brush
5:52let's see here who what she's a she's pigmented all right so let me just do a
5:57little bit in case it's really intense and we'll just pop this right in here
6:02come thru gold and i'm going to just take this down right in the corner
6:10ok this gold I'm like I can't stop staring at it
6:15so ready we got the gold going to the cranberry into the transition
6:19I definitely want to do a little bit
6:22of a kind of Darkness not necessarily liner but I want that crazy liner fact
6:27so I'm gonna be dipping into teddy bear yes and we're using the more feet
6:33I 14 crash i'm just going to take this and go really low
6:38almost yeah well my lash line is and kind of go a little tiny bit in the
6:43crease with that dark color just so i have some like real depth to this look
6:48so I'm not taking it in there it's just really subtle settle settle settle
6:53there's nothing subtle about this look but I this is a subtle part
6:57let me feel this tape off and see what's under this mess my whole skin like pills
7:03off who lowered guide me through this misery Bay on
7:08mmm now is the side going to be even though oh my god of here
7:13BAM she is kunchi ok now that the tape is off
7:18I see everybody always taking black liquid or a black liner and doing it
7:22across the lid and up I want to be different and not do that because this
7:27the shadows are so pretty it's like a beautiful like sunset I'm like zoo on
7:32the shadows together are perfect so let's just focus on the bottom
7:37now i'm just going to take my black mac smolder eye pencil and we're just going
7:42to tightline that water line really thinly
7:46all right now for under the eyes i'm going to take this color called so jelly
7:53it's like how do you explain this color it's so pretty like a peachy soft
7:58coralie I don't know what it's like I don't have to explain it it's just first
8:02so I'm taking my Tom Ford 14 pencil brush and I'm just gonna pop some of
8:08this down below that liner
8:11oh yes when your upper shadow is so intense you don't really need to like do
8:18crazy crazy under here
8:19we're just going to have the lens
8:21this into the gold ok now I brought this almost like the middle of my iris
8:27so now i'm going to be taking this color called cranberry splash right here with
8:32the same brush and I'm just going to dip into their really lightly now I'm going
8:36to take that and drag it under and normally you guys know I love to drag my
8:41liner on the bottom out we're actually going to keep it tight today
8:45and notice how that black liner on top I've sort of mixed it now that we've
8:49gotten towards the end of the eyeball and I'm taking the black and I'm just
8:53kind of dragging it down almost like little downward motions so it creates a
8:58really nice smoky effect
9:00I want to keep that darkness towards the end of my eye and now i'm just going
9:04back and forth and back and forth
9:06if an eyeshadow is extreme with the pigment and you want to just test it out
9:10I'll dab it into the pan and then I'll really lightly go over until I really
9:15know densified it can get
9:17then I'll go over it more harder meaning my pressure
9:21so the first time I was barely dragging it across now I'm like really pushing it
9:26into my eyes so I can get that cranberry effect
9:28this is Jorge's now usually smoke it out really happy and bring it down i'm going
9:33to keep it a little more light today and i'm going to be dipping and to that so
9:38jelly color one more time with a little small morphe brush and I'm just going to
9:43go over it one more time
9:46there we go we're just going to merge these two together so they're like
9:49becoming best friends again and then I'm gonna dip in a cranberry splash one more
9:53time with the same brush and then just kind of blend them together
9:58all right i am obsessed with this I look but it wouldn't be complete without some
10:03amazing lashes so let's put them on and I'm going to curl my lashes with the Too
10:08Faced better than sex mascara before I put on them lashes bottom master is so
10:18essential for this look like bring it all together
10:22for lashes today i'm gonna be using the violet boss faux mink style lashes these

3:08really warm toned so normally you guys know I like to take my shadows all the
3:12way down
3:13i am going to not do that today and just try something a little different if you
3:19want to fast-track and blend this out you can go in with your white peach
3:23color again and just buff it out really soft and then I like to go back and
3:28forth back and forth after lack a southern page just blend and blend in

3:55so let's dab in some summary yum i love the names for the shadows there are cute
4:01it was going to tuck that in there a little bit is for some added definition
4:05it's really not going to be that big of a difference it's a little more darker
4:09so I'm just adding in depth right now and then we're going to take tempting
4:13right after that little darker
4:15we're just gonna tuck that in our crease I'm not gonna drag my black all the way
4:21down like I normally do you want to stop it and just kind of drag it away and
4:26then go back in with the blending brush dab a little bit of parade in there and
4:30go over it so it's all about the back and forth back and forth with this look
4:34you really want this to look blend it out

4:45just going to go straight for highlight and glitter for this
4:48I look already there's this color called luscious I'm like whoo
4:52so this one right here is let's just now when i first looked today I was like
4:56okay this is q i swatched it on my finger and I was like during this sure
5:00looks good so I'm just going to take this little flat brush this is from
5:03morphe there's no number I've had this for like a really long time so surrender
5:08the number but I know they must still have this and why pigment I'm just going
5:13to highlight under my brow a little bit
5:17hello my browser like
5:21thank you Jesus you always forget us it's a different look and there you guys
5:25are probably what you're like really going on with the highlight and there's
5:28something really soft and delicate because they have to draw my eyebrows
5:33I can't just wipe off powder if it gets my brown hair i got to be really careful
5:37so you regular folks have it easy now I'm going to take the same brush same
5:43luscious color and i'm just going to pop it in my inner corner right now
5:47well because i just want to see how it's going to look shimmery and i'm also
5:52going to put it a little under my eye here
5:56all right now before we do the under eye and let's put on 15 layers of glitter
6:01i'm gonna be using this violence boss amazing as it is just amazing this is
6:06called copper Ella
6:08it is perfect for this look and they actually have glitter like adhesive
6:13already it's called their secret weapon glitter adhesive so let's use that I am
6:18too faced has glitter glue as well but this one is like quick and easy like my
6:25all Max's fuck boys and we're just going to coach this whole made and we're going
6:32to go under that darkness that I created earlier and everything that i'm coding
6:36will have glitter on it now if you don't want glitter just skip this part
6:41if you're watching my channel and you don't want glitter and no one's okay so
6:49oh my glitter is poured it all over my crotch so I just like to take them out
6:53and put it on the cap and i think i'm going to take a little brush
6:56this is like an old Mac brush i have and we're just gonna
6:59ah we're going to come because gosh
7:03jarred that she was good
7:04let it and we're just going to coat everywhere that glue was and i'm going
7:08to be really delicate i hate when glitter gets everywhere so you just
7:11gotta pass this on
7:13now there's going to be a little fall out some sparkles on my face we'll deal
7:17with that later for now I just want to make sure my eyelids look like copper
7:21the last oh this letter is the glitter is basically done for now if you want
7:30you can put glitter and down here i'm going to leave it kind of like more
7:34fresh uplifting i noticed a lot of the times that always do dark under my eyes
7:38look at me glitter everywhere
7:39hi middle of rubbing all over me sometimes it's just like one of those
7:43things I'm like huh
7:45don't go to waste hike later oh my god it's all over my labia minora
7:50alright so for under the eyes what are we gonna do
7:54i think i'm gonna do there's so many options
7:57I'm going to do black liner not that any of your shock but i'm not going to
8:01smudge it out
8:01really crazy this is smouldered from Mac you know that's my favorite
8:06and we're just going to do it really tight on the water lines so we're not
8:09going to drag it down and do a really dramatic like I normally do
8:12it's just literally going to be that that's it all right so we got the liner
8:16on in there
8:16now we are going to smoke it out a little bit i'm going to keep with that
8:20round family at the bottom and just use these two again and then we're going to
8:24go in with Just Peachy it's like this amazing
8:26peachy coral i mean it's it's a peach coral color and I'm going to blend that
8:30in my inner corners and then we're going to smoke it out a little more
8:34so let's use this more fee for 33 brush and dip into that peach color
8:40I'm just going to put it over luscious so it's almost like I'm layering
8:44oh wow pretty I was going to layer this a few times now being really delicate
8:49and I'm just kind of pressing it into my skin I'm not going back and forth all
8:53crazy now i'm going to go in with this top four pencil brush and I'm just going
8:57to play around with that puree and so yummy
9:00one more time and then there's one of the top here called charmed I'm sure
9:04I'm going to dip into that one as well I'm going to pray and summer yum and the
9:08same time so many different here and then different here so it kind of makes
9:11its own color and then I'm just going to go under that I and just kind of stuff
9:17out
9:18I'm only doing you know half my lids like from the iris out blend
9:24then I'm going to take this morphy 514 brush and I'm just going to dip into
9:29that
9:30charmed I'm sure it's like a topi darker brown and we're just going to lightly
9:35buff that under bring it out just create a little more depth to that under I then
9:42that blending brush we used earlier same thing i'm going to go in with that same
9:46charm color and we're just gonna pop it and blend it out
9:49out all right now before we do lashes and mascara i'm going to take this color
9:54called nectar it's like a gold in let her know it's golden yumminess
9:58and I'm going to dip into that with that same morphe brush and I'm gonna do it at
10:02the inner inner corner
10:04so it's like that extra little pop if I turn to the side you can definitely see
10:09that this is a two-faced palette tutorial it only makes sense that I used
10:14that better than sex to face mascara i love this one I know they have a new
10:18waterproof one that I have not tried yet it comes in the mail in a few days so if
10:23you've tried the waterproof one
10:24tell me maybe in the comments what you guys think of it because i cannot wait
10:28to try it this is like one of my favorite mascara is not the only issue I
10:32have with it is what I do my bottom lashes if i look down for a period of
10:36time
10:37it kind of creates those black dots so when I heard that the waterproof version
10:41was coming I likes grange so hopefully that will alleviate that issue because
10:47who was that
10:49alright so after I do this bottom mascara i'm going to show you guys a
10:52little trick that I like to do first we're gonna hold our breath because this
10:55brush is so big sometimes if i'm not paying attention i hit the bristles on
11:00my eye
11:00and then you guys know it's all downhill from there so take a deep breath make
11:04the weirdest face that you can and go for it
11:09alright so if you ever look down and get those black mascara . that i was talking
11:13about earlier
11:14a lot of the times i find it really easy to take a like dr beauty blender and any
11:20like setting powder that's translucent so like this cat cosmetics one is great
11:24I just dab a little bit of it on the end and then i'll take it and all go where
11:29the lashes are and I'll just kind of dust translucent powder on the ends so I
11:34do not get those mascara marks and for the most part it usually works unless
11:39you live in like Florida or Africa or the humidity is really insane
11:44this should definitely work for you now for lashes going to go and JD's are
11:48really pretty these are the faux mink ones from sephora you guys have seen us
11:52do this a million times think these are cute they're subtle ish settle for me
11:56but I think they're gonna still let that glitter show and have at the moment so
12:00let me
12:01precut these and measure my eye off camera and i will be right back
12:05all right so I just trim these i'm going to put my glue on high glue if you guys
12:11know any lash glue that is non latex and doesn't smell like old people to China
12:20of bingo game
12:21please leave some comments below I need an amazing latch company that the google
12:27actually like hold my inner corners because they always have the issue where
12:3010 minutes later the corners up and I'm like I'm gonna kill / so please help
12:36your bitch out
12:37now you guys know I like to just place these in the
12:40little of my lid and then I'll take tweezers and just kind of mold them
12:45around where I want to go just kind of hold them down like don't move or I'll
12:50cut you
12:51anyone else ever have a problem or like the first lash is perfect and then you
12:55go to put on the second one in your eyelids off

3:43taking my mac 25 to brush my go-to and we're just gonna you know take this
3:48color and put it right below the brow
3:51i am going to add some shimmer in a little bit
3:55this is going to act as like my primer I don't really use eyeshadow primer is a
3:59lot so I love to put down a shadow and I like to drag this past the prowl for the
4:07transition color I'm going to be dipping into this orange one
4:10I love the shade and it is really pigmented this is that Gucci blending
4:16brush number 20 and I'm just gonna place that bright in my crease and blend out
4:24and I'm going to take that and bring it into the brow bone and we're just going
4:28to take the brush and start popping up to give it that really nice blended
4:32outlook
4:33I want this to look seamless and airbrush like my vagina
4:39getting there I do like to bring it into my contour on the nose
4:43it has that dramatic look all right now I'm going to take this amazing copper
4:47shade right here and I'm going to be chipping in with the little bobby brown
4:52eyeshadow brush just start placing this on the lid
4:56now what I love to do is take the mac fix+ this is the coconut flavor and
5:01spray the brush a little bit for that full metallic moment and then once you
5:07go on the lid
5:09haha hi there we go so I'm just going to take this and start buffing it on the
5:13entire lid
5:15all right now I definitely need to add some depth and dimension into my crease
5:19so I'm just going to be going in with this guy and see how that looks at first
5:24now the shadows are very pigmented so you definitely want to knock out your
5:28fall out
5:29BAM this is a matte shadow so I'm just gonna tuck this in my crease right above
5:34that copper shimmer just my lids really dark and dramatic
5:39all right now we're basically merging the two shadows with this together and
5:44we're just going to take it down here here
5:47I don't really want it on my lid so I'm just gonna be really gentle and then you
5:51can take your blending brush and go back in with that orange color and just kind
5:57of go over that darkness again so it blends out nicely
6:01now i'm going to start on my under eyes now for the inner rim month i'm going to
6:06be using the anastacio pro pencil
6:09I love this it's not start white like I normally do it's more than nude color
6:13and i'm just going to take my Beauty Blender as always to get into that water
6:17line
6:18so my elasticity of my eyes does not fall apart it settle it's not too crazy
6:23but it definitely opens and lifts the eye
6:26ok now that the water line is done i'm going to softly add some shading under
6:31it going to take this mac 239 brush and I'm going to dip lightly into that
6:38transition color that we used earlier which is this guy and I want to actually
6:42mix it with this other bronzy color so it's creating its own color on a lightly
6:48just go under where it just to the liner
6:52now you can actually skip this part and just do mascara if you're not feeling as
6:56dramatic but if you don't like drama
6:58why the fuck are we even watching this together it's going to take it and go
7:02all the way always going to go all the way we're going to basically connect
7:07this inner part with the below
7:10there we go and I'm just laughing about being really soft motions
7:15now with the same brush I'm going to take a darker color dip into this guy
7:19right here and I'm just going to lightly buff it under my eyes in between that
7:26light and what I just laid down so it's almost like a second liner
7:31I'm just going to do it really like the middle now i'm going to take my blending
7:34brush from earlier and without any new product on it i'm just going to blend it
7:39out a little softer now i'm going to highlight the eyes and i'm going to take
7:45the same back to buy to brush and I'm actually going to dip into this metallic
7:49shimmer up here
7:51hello metallic now I'm just going to take it under my brow bone and just
7:56about fit on a little bit just have a little bit more depth and shine and glow
8:01now because the lids are really dark
8:07I want to brighten them up a little bit add some more dimension you guys know
8:11I'm obsessed with shimmer and glitter
8:14so I'm going to add this Sheila magnificent metals these are really
8:18metallic and you can use it with your finger
8:21this one is called metallic peach and
8:23I'm just going to apply this on the lid and i just love that soft metallic love
8:29em
8:30how can we make such weird faces over to heating near the I like what I'm doing
8:33mascara I'm like before I apply my false lashes
8:38y'all know I can't do it without mascara so today I'm going to be using the ultra
8:44nor black black mascara from chanel i love chanel makeup

8:57with this
8:59I love this mascara separates the bottom lash and very
9:08all right now I'm going to take my trusty duo lash glue as the glue is
9:15getting tachy I like to really thank the band so it will form to your eyelid
9:20better
9:21you never wanted to just be straight out comes out of that box you want that
9:26slight curve
9:27now I always apply these with tweezers it's a lot easier for me of course if
9:32you don't like tweezers you do you and I like to just place them in the center of
9:37my lid and while the glue is still tacky and drawing down you want to move them
9:44around to the desire to the location and if the corners are ever giving you
9:48trouble
9:49this hold them down and press in all right now that the latches are on
9:54i am looking at my I look and I think I want a little bit more shimmer in my
9:59inner corner
10:00I'm just going to take the same stealing stuff with a brush already use for under
10:03my eye and I'm just going to lightly padded and tiny little inner corner

12:52definitely going to be playing with more color and trying things out of my

13:00suggestions on any looks you want to see leave some feedback below and I will see
13:05you on the next one bye guys
0:18what's up everyone welcome back
0:22now I know it's been a second since I've done a full makeup tutorial so today I
0:26thought
0:27listen um it's time today's like i'm going to give you some dramatic winged
0:32liner I was looking through my videos and I'm like damn I haven't done a link
0:35in a minute so here's a way i will be doing plenty of them for you guys so if
0:39you want to know how to create this look keep on watching
0:42all right let's get started today i'm going to be using a new kat von d beauty
0:46product this is the locket color correcting eyeshadow primer
0:51I got the lightest shade for me now these are supposed to primary lid and
0:56also color correct in case you have any dark circles
1:00so I'm just gonna take a little bit of this and it's now I'm just going to take
1:07a little brush with no product and just drag that around so we make sure it's
1:12evenly all right now the star of today's look is Pam the many mua makeup geek
1:22collaboration palette
1:24I am obsessive about hi when I first saw it
1:28the red one Mars immediately was like oh my god
1:32red eyeshadow i'm going to start off this look by using some of the light
1:37shades for blending purposes for my transition color to start
1:42i'm gonna be using the soul Mac 224 brush is my favorite you guys know and
1:47i'm going to be dipping into rat pee and Sora and we're just going to mix these
1:51two together and I'm just going to put this right in my socket and blend blend
1:58blend
1:59now we are going to do a really dramatic wing today so i'm going to do really
2:04dramatic eye shadow I mean it goes hand in hand right before i get ready for
2:09these lashes
2:10I've been in Hawaii for a week I were fake lashes every day so my real lashes
2:14are pretty janky right now I think I totally need to take a break on wearing
2:19makeup
2:19but that's like removing my arms and legs so hopefully my lashes will get
2:24over it and not hate me too much
2:26now the cool thing about these shadows as they are really pigmented and they
2:29blend quick so you don't have to spend a lot of time blending it kind of does the
2:33job for you
2:34all right now I'm going to take this mac 217 brush and I'm going to dip right
2:38into Mars now I pigment
2:41this is like a deep red i love Reds every time I see a red I'm just like a
2:46home
2:48I'm gonna take this and remember we are going to do a really drastic Blackwing
2:52so I'm going to take this red I'm just gonna start putting it in the crease and
2:56a little lower on my lid
2:58well so we can really smoke it out and get that rusty dramatic effect
3:04and I'm going to take it and go all the way to the lash line just not all over
3:08here we're just going to stick it to most you know the corners and i'm going
3:11to go back in with that same brush and dip interviewees
3:15just like and soften the line and blend up now
3:22oh my god I felt like Jesus just part of the Red Sea because I'm obsessed with
3:28this look already
3:29ok so now when I saw Luna this metallic foil one right here I was like oh so i
3:35am going to wet brush you can use any synthetic little brush you want and i am
3:41going to dip into that one
3:43oh my god listen here it's not even out my skin yeah and i'm like oh and i'm
3:50going to take this and drag it all the way to the inner corner and half white
3:56hand so it's like really blended now you guys know I like to pack on those
4:00metallic so I could have stopped but you know I have an issue with that
4:04so I'm just going to keep on packing it and I'm gonna also drag it a little bit
4:09down here because you know we are going to do that bottom shadow eventually
4:13someone's going to start now and then of course to blend you want to take Mars
4:17one more time and just kind of Pat and blend in that shimmer
4:20so I just flows nicely together and notice how I'm just connecting and
4:25popping that color right there
4:29course if you want your red back one more time we're going to go in there and
4:32just kind of Pat it in
4:33it should create a little blend in fact what i like to call it
4:37ok now you can save the bottom shadow or later
4:41I like to just do it now before the wing okay before we add any more shadow
4:46let's get to cutting that fear swing all right to get that crazy bitch I'm gonna
4:50kill you winged liner i like to use two products swarms over
4:55I like to use two products and that is the YSL babydoll liner and then to fill
5:01in i'm going to be using my chart black clay liner
5:05I love this stuff this is like water proof that does not move but to begin
5:09let's get the blackout now I love this because you that see that bristle
5:14so then and it just really helps you create your shape so let's start now I
5:20like to start from the middle and just create a shape of what i want and i just
5:28kinda start carving it out
5:31now i do want to follow my lash line and create a natural you know going to get
5:36up angle and that's where my wings going to start
5:38does that look beautiful right now he'll know it looks like shit but it got it
5:42has to start somewhere so as the liner is drying i'm going to take some in just
5:48your drag it up
5:51oh now you definitely have a steady hand so if you drink into new york red bulls
5:55or you're at all hasn't kicked in yet
5:58just you know wait it out we're all because you really got to focus on this
6:02part a lot of back and forth
6:04I get asked all the time what's a quick trip no trick for a wing and I'm like
6:08there really isn't one
6:09I like to really get up close to let me just use this palette has helped some
6:14golden wings take time so do not rush this debt or you're gonna regret it
6:21ok so let's
6:23put that back for a second and now we're going to go in with our liner and you
6:26can use any little liner brush you have this is sonia one from target i love
6:32sharp that is
6:33mmm and I just like to dip in the pot hi I've missed a million times and then
6:38product dries fairly quickly so you just wanna get it on that damn and blend
6:45now why didn't I just use the liquid because this will really make sure it
6:49stays all day I'm days
6:51there we go gradually adding and plotted from dragging up
6:54all right now I'm just gonna clean up the edges
6:57bring it out even more mmm
7:01there we go are right now that the wing is done before we do lashes i am going
7:06to do a little bit of light smoky on the bottom so that all right now for a liner
7:14I wanted to do like a weird
7:17burgundy purpley kinda look now I know some people don't like that they think
7:21it makes them look - like drugged out but the first shadow ever wore was a
7:27rusty red and put it in my waterline and I think everyone thought I was on heroin
7:31or something but i'm having a little flashback friday so i'm going to be
7:34using the rihanna Mac Talk That Talk lip pencil for my eye
7:39hopefully I'll go blind and if i do is the last time you'll ever see
7:44all right so you know what you know what it is we're gonna use a Beauty Blender
7:48and pull the i get in the way this looks cool actually i like I'm feeling this
7:54and beyond easy of course I'm gonna bust out some of that with eyeshadow so we
8:00are definitely not done
8:02all right now I'm going to take a little Tom Ford pencil brush and I'm going to
8:08dip into Mars
8:10BAM and then I want to do a little bit of insomnia
8:16it's like such a pretty like duochrome metal I gotta try it so first we're
8:20going to take a little pencil brush and we're gonna lightly just dragged under
8:25the liner

8:33brown you can do anything you want
8:35so don't feel like you have to do a red with this look I'm just being a little
8:38you know have a little artsy bulb it here but i always do black and my
8:44waterline so I definitely want to change it up today and I'm just gonna budge and
8:48drag and i'm actually going to take that and put it under the wing just the hair

0:20Jeffrey I'm just a sweet country christian gal with the dream and here we
0:25are and i just can't believe that gets a good makeup everyday
0:28ok but for real hi guys i missed you so I've had a really crazy month there has
0:33been so much going on besides traveling a lot
0:37i recently got in that crazy car accident thank God for geico full
0:41coverage because i was able to get the full entire cost of my car
0:45it was a total loss and it was all paid for thank you Jesus so you know i'm not
0:50i just can't believe that I'm even here and I'm even able to you know have a
0:55brand and have a successful business so I'm like you know what I literally you
0:59know not to be morbid but I could have died a few weeks ago so I was like
1:02having a realization like you know what if I can you know by things that I've
1:08always dreamed of buying why am I being apprehensive about it i literally have
1:12one life and it's so short on this earth I was like you know what I'm buying
1:16something I've wanted since I was 12 so after I got my settlement check
1:20I walked into that Lamborghini dealership and i said hi my name is Miss
1:24Starr and I was like one so I can't believe that you guys but I bought a
1:29Lamborghini her con
1:31it is the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen though my hobbies and things that I
1:35love your makeup cars and talk so I just want to say one thing you know it's not
1:39about materialistic items
1:41it's about your goals that you set for yourself and one of my goals was to have
1:45a lambo and have a business
1:47no it's not about the cars and jewelry and all that bullshit because when
1:50you're on your deathbed that shit is not going to matter but it was a moment for
1:54me because I never would have dreamed of having that ever in my driveway
1:59so you know it's crazy but i just want to say that anyone can do it look at me
2:04i am just one guy and makeup that started out with just hopes and dreams
2:09and i did not fit in high school
2:11no one really believed in me and if I can do it
2:14you definitely can so not to sound like a motivational speaker but honestly go
2:18after your dreams
2:19stop living for everyone else i see so many people that just stop what they're
2:23doing because other people are judging them or they think that they're not
2:26going to fit in
2:27stop it do you so besides that I had a little like moment like i got home

2:49time for that so basically algorithm if you don't know what that means it's like
2:53the system of Instagram so if a bunch of people are attacking you and saying

4:08kind of like swiping around i'm actually
4:10like packing it into the skin which is

4:16longer throughout the day and make sure
4:18that it doesn't move around

5:28around my face and get that really
5:30bronzy pretty look going all right now
5:33it's really snatched that forehead i'm
5:34adding in a lot today because we're
5:36really going to focus on skin contour
5:38and highlight I'm using this makeup
5:40forever brush because it just get a big
5:42area really quickly and it just blends
5:45nicely so I'm gonna go a little darker
5:46than usual on the forehead if you're
5:49afraid of that you do not have to do
5:50with this dark but I could play around
5:52sometimes you don't always have to do
5:53your same routine switch it up feeling
5:56wrongs now i'm definitely going to do
6:01the nose quickly now when I mean by that
6:02is I like to take this and I like to
6:04press my hands like this so we make it
6:06even more and then I'm gonna barely
6:08touch the pan
6:11ok now we're just going to go right down
6:14so if you want to contour your nose in a
6:16flash and really quickly just go down
6:19and go to town girl right now we're
6:24going to take a little more fiji three
6:25again and go into that lightest shade i
6:28was going to kind of go over the jaw and
6:30soften her a little bit so it's not so
6:32harsh
6:33I'm just trying to have a moment today
6:34so where is also going to take that
6:36powder again and we're just going to go
6:39over the contour on the forehead with it
6:43just kind of soften it so it's not too
6:44severe gonna go over that knows a bit so
6:47we're not like too crazy because it's
6:48hard to breathe right now we are
6:51contoured now i'm going to quickly do
6:53some eyebrows off camera if you want to
6:54see how i draw them on i will put a link
6:56in the description box down below so
6:59back all right now this I like is
7:01probably one of the most easiest i have
7:03ever done on my channel so we're going
7:04to take a little Mac painterly Paint Pot
7:07and we're just going to coat our entire
7:09lid with that really quickly and just
7:11kinda give our eyes second primer and
7:14now the foundation and concealer that is
7:16on my lids definitely enough but is it
7:18now for eyeshadow get ready for this one
7:21does it is a really simple
7:23I'm gonna pull out my little busy our
7:25palate
7:25I love with this guy it is it's been
7:28through a lot in through some lot of
7:29traveling definitely broke this months
7:32ago thats hanging on a thread right now
7:34people but it's okay because guess what
7:36it still works I'm sure you can see
7:37right here this is one of my favorite
7:39shade it just hit pan the other day and
7:41it is the perfect like ivory bone white
7:44color to put all over your legs and I
7:46like to take this and put it from my
7:47brow bone all the way down and it just
7:50gives you a really lifted look and this
7:52is also going to help that crease color
7:54blend effortlessly alright
7:56the base is laid down alright so this
7:58look is almost done actually no that's
8:00kind of shocking so I'm gonna take a
8:02little blending brush any blending brush
8:04that you want will suffice and I'm gonna
8:06pull out the beauty killer palette now
8:08the shade Courtney girl this is the tea
8:11and the truth so we're just gonna go
8:13into her for a second
8:15now this is where it gets really easy so
8:17the other day when I posted that look I
8:19literally just took this brush and I had
8:20like 20 minutes to get ready before i
8:22went somewhere and I think you know what
8:24I'm just gonna be really really soft and
8:25pretty today and see what happens which
8:27is scary because meet me toning it down
8:29takes a lot of me so I took it and I
8:32literally went all the way and we're
8:35talking just right there so even though
8:38like make sure knows thinner by the way
8:39it's a little trick I've been doing
8:41forever
8:42you just gotta flick up and blend this
8:44crease color into the white shadow that
8:46you just laid down now this is where you
8:48can stop it here you can go out more i
8:51like to take it and even put it on my
8:53lashline and lit a little bit so almost
8:56like hugs it i mean if this is not the
8:58most simple I've ever done girl
9:00get ready and then you're gonna go back
9:02in with that shade of one more time and
9:04you're just gonna put in a little bit
9:06more in to the crease and y la we are
9:11like there you could stop here now I
9:14always say this if you want to add more
9:15you definitely can but if you really
9:18want to stop here
9:20it's ok but i am going to add in just a
9:22little bit of dimension to my lids so
9:24I'm gonna go in with shade vanity
9:26it is a dark like black and plum color
9:30and I'm just going to go into the little
9:32detail brush and I'm just going to
9:34lightly barely put some into my crease
9:37just so my lids have like some extra
9:40drama i'm going to go back in with the
9:41blending brush and just take it and
9:43soften it so there's no extra powder
9:45again on any of the brushes we're just
9:47gonna really just make the lid have a
9:49little oh hi
9:51so it's not so flat all right now to
9:54make your eyes pop a little bit we're
9:55gonna take a little fascinating white
9:57liner from Mac where it's going to take
9:58that beauty blender have it lightly pull
10:00down our water line and then we're gonna
10:02pack in that white liner and turn into
10:05it all fam

10:12of mascara no shocker here i'm gonna be
10:15going with my benefit roller lash and
10:17we're going to coat our entire top and
10:19bottom lashes and this is really going
10:20to make this look pop-and-lock just
10:23really allocate and slay all right let's
10:26put this on
10:30now for blush today i'm going to be

0:00what's up everyone welcome back to the pink fabulous channel
0:13mrs. jeffree star for today's look I wanted to recreate a look I saw a Jaclyn
0:18hill film recently she did this beautiful halo smokey eye and when I saw
0:23it I was like mesmerized and glued to the screen like it looked perfect on her
0:28and I i was inspired i wanted to do my version of course my face shape is a
0:33little different than hers so I tailored look to fit my bone structure but trying
0:39to stay true to what she did and i love it i think it's really gorgeous
0:42it's an everyday look at anyone could wear it's very dramatic but also settle
0:48at the same time so it's not too
0:50you know it's not - punchy I love watching other youtubers and I love
0:53watching what other people are doing because it's so fun to be inspired I
0:57normally wouldn't do this look at myself but after watching her as I was like man
1:00you know I got to give this a try
1:02so i hope i did her look justice if you want to see how i created this and keep
1:06watching
1:07let's get started now I haven't used my Bobby Brown vitamin face base in a
1:13minute this is what i normally use on the daily if you've never tried this
1:17get the fuck out of your seat and get in the car and go to support at now
1:23Beauty Blender actually just put out a new color this is the nude ache I love
1:28this color
1:29I love to just take this put it in and you're just going to coat your entire
1:34face with this and this is really good for people with normal to dry skin oily
1:39I would stay away from this and get something a little more mattifying for
1:42foundation I'm going to be using my trusty do your air flash you guys know I
1:46can't live without this and i also tried a new cocktail normal and mixes with the
1:52Armani but today i'm going to be using that lower mercier silk creme
1:57photo finish foundation now I got to shade a little darker than my normal
2:02skin tone just like a little more bronzy i'm going to take the air flashes usual
2:07now we're going to take this guy and i'm going to be using the artiste old
2:13brushes
2:14I'm going to probably break the rules and just apply the foundation on the
2:17garage and before I brush it i'm going to . it around my entire face
2:23now the reason why i like this is it really cuts down the time of blending
2:26it's like minimal and you're pretty much done quicker than you've ever gotten
2:31ready your whole entire life so let's get to brushing and blending all right
2:41now because this foundation is a little bit warmer
2:44i am going to do some really light concealer so I'm gonna take that urban
2:48decay naked skin it looks really full-coverage i think on camera but it
2:52just blends really nice and the cool thing about this product as a little
2:56goes a long way so you don't want to overdo it
3:00now i'm actually going to take the Beauty Blender and buff this out
3:04so let's get to blending all right concealer is blended now before the
3:15under eyes want to crease on me
3:17I'm going to be setting it with some loose powder and my favorite is the
3:21Chanel when I keep going back to it and I love to take it with the damp Beauty
3:25Blender and all this literally go like this and dip in and there's some powder
3:29on it and I just pressed it under my eyes and blood and tap it in
3:34all right under eyes are set now i'm actually going to set my entire face
3:38with Studio Fix from mac cosmetics I've been doing that forever and that's just
3:43like my go-to secret to keeping on that foundation throughout the whole day so
3:47I'm going to take my trusty Tom Ford powder brush
3:50we're just going to dip into that studio fix and I'm not going to do the under
3:54eye areas but i'm going to go around everything else
4:00all right now let's contour the face for contour i'm gonna be using the morphe em
4:06five to seven
4:08ever since I saw Jacqueline use it I got five of these brushes and can't stop
4:12using it so thanks for the tip girl
4:14I'm gonna be going in with my trusty Kat Von D shade and light I want to try
4:17something new where I don't go as deep into
4:19a contour as I normally do why because I'm just trying to stuff so I'm going to
4:25start my client or a little normal then I usually do and i'm going to stop right
4:31there usually go a lot lower
4:33but i want a different type of effect today and that's the cool thing about
4:36makeup as you can literally have a different face shapes with look if you
4:39want to
4:42now we're just gonna carve out this chin and just contour along the hairline
4:47all right now i use this more p-47 brush the other day and I really liked it for
4:54the nose
4:55i blend it out with the Beauty Blender and I just like the effect now the cool
4:58thing about this one it really chisels so if you don't want to save your nose
5:01contour try something else
5:03but this one made my nose really slender honey like she's going at it if you guys
5:13randomly hear my dog delicious
5:15screaming in the background there's people hanging curtains and doing
5:18construction in my house so he's going a little cuckoo
5:22all right for brows i'm actually going to draw them on with the new pencil on
5:26estas da came out with a new product called the brow definer and i'm going to
5:31use shade blonde today
5:34this is my first time ever using this so let's see what happens
5:38I think I'm a good critique at formula and this one's really great sharp
5:47all right now I'm going to finish up the brows with the pro pencil from on estas
5:54yet now I love this because it's a nice highlight and i'm just going to put this
5:58directly under the brow and i'm going to take a mac 252 brush and just soften
6:05that line
6:06now let's get started on the eyeshadow for this look I'm going to be using the
6:14Anasazi of self-made palette now Jaclyn credible I like with this so I'm going
6:19to use the same thing i'm going to be going in first with sherbert being on
6:24right there and that's going to be our
6:26transition color and I'm gonna be going in with a morphy 441 blending brush and
6:32I'm just gonna get in there and pump it out
6:36hey there's no big fans are bringing the transition color all the way here just
6:41because my face is longer i like to give it that extra and you really want this
6:47well blended so spend a lot of time going back and forth and i'm actually
6:52going to take that same mac 252 brush and just blend this out a little bit
6:56with no product it's the one I used earlier and we're just going to soften
7:00and then go back to the other side and repeat all right now let's go in with a
7:08mac 217 brush and I'm going to be dipping into this color right here hot
7:12chocolate and we're going to start by taking that color and tucking it into
7:17the crease here and bringing it down to the lid and I was doing packing motions
7:23so we're going to avoid any fallout
7:26all right now i'm going to be taking a pencil brush this one is from chanel its
7:33number 19 i love this one at the pencil brush but it's still kind of dough me
7:38and more thick at the top
7:40instead of being really narrow so you can use any pencil brush that you want
7:43and we're still going to be using the hot chocolate shade
7:46this time I'm just going to be going in side here and this is how we're going to
7:51create that halo effect and just pack in that color
7:56and then I'm going to take my brush right of the transition color and just
7:59soften these edges out a little more now for the middle color this was like my
8:05favorite part of Jaclyn's look was that metallic shimmer in the middle i'm going
8:10to be taking this mac brush you don't brush you use it so much the number
8:15wears off you have to like put it in the light like this is a 230 grow up have
8:22this brush for like ten fucking years i'm going to be using the pink champagne
8:25color right here now if you wet the brush this shit is like oh it's heaven
8:30so we're going to take my fixed plus as usual and we're just gonna and then
8:34you're going to go in with that color and just quote your brush with it and
8:39just start placing it right on the lid oh my lord
8:43oh so pretty i want to die like I don't know if I want to be buried in this
8:48color on my funeral and I was going back and forth and packing and I'm bringing
8:52it right up to that transition color but not going on top of it
8:57so you want to stop it right as you get to that and now that that metallic
9:01colors laid down you're going to go back in with your brush to add the hot
9:05chocolate you're just going to kind of blend out the edges softly I didn't put
9:08any new shadow on this I'm just kind of going back and forth so now for under
9:12the brow we're going to be highlighting a little bit i'm going to be using the
9:14shade up here called the buttery
9:16I'm just going to take this and softly and blend it on top just so it gives it
9:21a little more dimension to my love
9:24now run to the I'm going to take that illamasqua I painful this is shade valve
9:29it's like a screaming flesh Tony white it's not the stark white I normally wear
9:33it's a more yellow tone which I love so I'm going to add that in my waterline
9:38now you can do any color you want with this brown black whatever i lo lighter
9:43tones because it really just opened up her eye and gets you a new look
9:47all right now we need to start smoking out the under eyes so let's get started
9:50on that smoke out the under eyes I'm gonna be taking this Smith cosmetics -
9:5420 brush
9:55i love how lattices it's really good for tucking under the eye
9:58and I'm gonna be going in with hot chocolate one more time and i'm just
10:02going to start upping that color and and connecting it with the outer parts
10:08this part like doing surgery will be really delicate if you are heavy-handed
10:13definitely pause and take like 20 hits forming now i'm using this mac 217 brush
10:18that we did already up here and I didn't put any new product on it i'm just going
10:22to be blending it out
10:24all right now for extra drama I'm going to be adding in a little bit of glitter
10:29in my inner corner and i'm going to be using this mac reflex read this letter
10:34is so pretty it's hard to tell on camera and so I put on my I but it's like
10:38intense and i'm just going to be putting that down with a little map
10:42- 13 brush you definitely want to put down he said because the reflex fine
10:46glitters tend to go everywhere so i'm going to be using this violet evolved
10:50loose pigment glitter adhesive and I'm gonna take like the tiniest amount is
10:55the tiny that is and just place it in my inner corner right there
11:00now i just take the glitter and open it and I just dip right in there your brush
11:05should become completely coated and I'll just knock off the little fallout back
11:09into the jar and then you're just going to press it right on there
11:12all right now for mascara i'm gonna be using my toothpaste better than sex and
11:16uses in a minute
11:16definitely been missing it I heard a rumor on Instagram mother coming with a
11:21waterproof version helpful thank God thank you lord
11:24let me just coat these entirely all right now for the bottom we're going to
11:27use the same thing and we're just going to coat them entirely you really need
11:32bottom mascara for this look because
11:34as well any part of mascara everydays now it's time for eyelashes may be using
11:38these blinking beauty lashes it says its style number two on the front so let's
11:43give them a world now I've been staying away from the latex duo but my inner
11:47corners never come up when i use it so I'm gonna be going back in and using
11:51this will let the glue dry on this one and we'll do the left i don't mean least
12:01the Lopez
12:02ok I can't believe I did these sober but my lashes are done
12:06so now it's time for the main event highlighting

12:15joint store to high-end is creating one

12:51pigmented said I wasn't expecting this
12:55oh wow this is in mainly pigmented like I want to turn the camera off and just
13:02roll around in it naked and you guys know my favorite is keith was bow now

14:54let me know in the comments below I can't wait to show you what's next
14:58i will see you next time bye guys
0:18what's up everyone welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to be using
0:22something really special
0:25- I know what it is well i'm sure you can tell from the title but BAM
0:30the new great girl tart collaboration this is the swamp Queen palette listen
0:36first of all before I even looked in the inside I was dying for the packaging it
0:40looks like real wood
0:41this is amazing and sticks to the Holt our family but it is so funny like it
0:47I just I just smiled here to here when I open this the pr package you guys was
0:51genius i mean i-i got a little alligator
0:54I don't want you to be so cute delicious tried to tell him and I was like no this
0:59is the cutest thing ever and it came in
1:00come on alligator wrapping paper
1:04I can't alright so her collaboration is this amazing palette it has I shadows
1:09that has a blush bronzer and a highlight I'm like uh-huh sure you guys know just
1:15getting but this is I just can't stop looking at me like oh it's just so
1:18pretty okay
1:18the reveal bail
1:22so go ahead you guys but he also made two lipsticks which ok now this one when
1:28me and Bonnie first met a few months ago I was in Texas and she picked me up to
1:33go to the mall and we had such a fun time and she was wearing a lip and I was
1:36like girl what is that lipstick and she was in the testing phase of this one so
1:42it's so cool to see it done and on my mouth because high this color is
1:46everything this palette and the lips as a collection they are limited edition
1:51and they will be on targets website starting june six and then they slowly
1:55start to roll out into all the stores a few weeks later so don't sleep on this
1:59today i created this entire I look and the lip using this collection so I think
2:05we should have a dive right in but before we play with this
2:08I just want to say that I think it is so amazing that all these youtubers are
2:12collapsing with a really huge brand
2:15and it's it's just wild because I come from working at the mat counter and back
2:20then only a huge corporation with you know they would collab with like huge
2:24celebrities or that type of thing so the fact that all these brands are believing
2:28in you tubers and makeup artist i think is really really dope so the fact that
2:33bunny got to do this is so just so real and I'm so proud of her so bunny you
2:38really killed it with this though I'm going to dive in and let's start playing
2:42today we're going to start off by priming my eyelids with the Urban Decay
2:44primer potion
2:46I know everyone is probably like oh my god why are using primer today I'm just
2:51in a mood i saw someone use this in a review again and i was like i forgot i
2:55have primers so why not use it like to put a lot on why not right now this one
3:00is limited edition what is this one called enigma
3:04hi nygma and instead of using my fingers I'm just going to apply this with a
3:08brush all over the lid and i'm going to bring it up even to almost my eyebrow
3:14ok now that the primer is settled let's dive into the palate now you guys know I
3:19love to do a really light shadow all over for my base so i'm going to use a
3:23baby with a flat synthetic brush and I'm just going to put it over my
3:28lids now I love the shade right off the bat because it literally almost matches
3:33my skin tone so it's going to be a perfect base for me and I'm just going
3:37to drag this up an hour
3:39okay for my transition color I'm going to go right in and use dog man this is
3:42such a dope
3:44rusty brown like warm like orange base
3:48that was a long explanation but it looks really really pretty so I'm just going
3:53to take a little what is this
3:55this is a little mac - it's set in and we're just going to go right in with
3:58this one
3:59now i'm just going to take this and blend it right into my socket oh good
4:04morning
4:05this color is oh so pretty
4:08i'm really loving warm tones I think for like ten years I just wore hot blue
4:13black silver and glitter
4:15so I'm kind of 11 getting back into the season now i'm going to take this and
4:19bring it right down to their so we're gonna kind of line that up with my
4:25eyebrows start blending into that nose contour for an extreme smokey look and
4:32I'm going to bring this down and go little my lash line
4:35not too much so we're just kind of creating a little the eyeshadows just
4:39hugging my entire I now we're going to go in with a little blending brush any
4:43eyeshadow blending brush that you love
4:45now we're going to get back in the dog man just ever so slightly and we're just
4:50gonna drag up
4:52and that light shadow that I already applied earlier is really going to help
4:55buffer and blend this out
4:57obviously the brush is doing its job but this is just a little extra just a
5:02little extra precaution and it just really helps make it look really nice
5:06I'm gonna go back in one more time you guys know smokey eyes a lot of back and
5:09forth back and forth
5:11you want to blend until you have carpal tunnel the next day because we're not
5:15playing games today and then you're going to want to repeat the same steps
5:19on the other eye and make it look identical
5:23all right now we're going to go back with that same brush and I'm going to
5:25dip into sippy sippy
5:27hi it's a really that's the cue same name
5:30I love this color it's like a chocolaty maroonish brown
5:35I know my trust me i know my color explanations are ridiculous
5:40I love it the undertone of this is so pretty it has like little fine
5:43sparkles of golden it so we don't get right into her and I'm going to put this
5:49in my crease so it makes it really deep set and then we're going to drag this
5:54down a little more
5:56so that's going to give us the illusion of like a really deep set like full
5:59i M and notice how I'm still leaving space in there for maybe nothing maybe
6:04color maybe liner and I know what I want to do yet but I'm going to spring this a
6:08little more and then if you want you can go back in with your blending brush and
6:13head dog man
6:15and go in
6:16there and blend it out even more depends on how blended you want to be but I
6:20think you for watching my channel you want to be blend did
6:24so let's start doing it all right now I took that darkness and I brought it out
6:29a little past there and then you're going to take this again
6:33let it in together and just kind of flick up and out and then we're going to
6:36go back in with sippy sippy and do the same thing over here
6:41all right we are blended and looking smokey
6:45so this is like a beautiful champagne gold and i was going to take this little
6:51math 242 brush is already glitter on this from the other day so ignore that
6:55that's on the other side so we're going to go and i'm just going to place this
7:00right in there
7:02top of the line now
7:03this shadow is yummy that was thinking about wedding the brush for like extra
7:09intensity but it's so pretty as it is and like I don't need to come on
7:13amazing formula i love an eye shadow it doesn't fucking x games and we're just
7:17going to pack a little more on put a lot on that inner corner like I want my
7:22inner corner to look extra terrestrial today
7:26who so I'm going to bring it all the way in to where my brow bone and my nose
7:31connect because i'm just that type of bitch today
7:35and then we're going to go back in with this brush one more time and you don't
7:38have to dip into it again if you don't want to but I'm just gonna blend out the
7:42gold and the brown a little bit so it just blends more seamlessly from one
7:47seamless blend
7:48how's your day all right now because you guys know I cannot live without more
7:51Sparkle and gold i'm going to just take sassy button one more time and I'm gonna
7:56put some in my inner corner and i'm actually gonna bring it down in to the
8:01lower lash line up like I cannot with this color you guys
8:06hi anyone from tar is watching I'm going to sassy by a single shadow for my
8:10birthday this year
8:11ok so i want to bring it to bar in because I'm gonna smoke out this bottom
8:15but i think that is good enough and now we're going to darken and smoking out
8:19the under eye so I'm going to dab in a little bit with a man cat and i'm going
8:24to start that off and i'm just going to take this really flat synthetic brush
8:27and
8:28i'm going to just start lightly shading under my eyes and then we're going to
8:33blend it in with that gold and i am going to add in liner to my waterline
8:38I don't know what I should do maybe you to the black or cream or white
8:42so let me just smoked out this a little bit more
8:46and then we'll figure out the liner all right now that there's smoked out
8:50I'm going to darken them a little bit more and make them like really blend
8:53nicely i'm going to make them blend out a little more you know it's a little
8:56more smoky right now the edges are not how I want them so i'm just going to use
9:00a little the morphe brush high and we're going to get in with madcat one more
9:05time and now this is really gonna give me that ability to like smoke it out way
9:10more
9:11jharkhand dramatic I need that effortless blend
9:15mm-hmm now this little detailed shader brush really lets you get in there
9:19without causing a lot of fallout and it just really blends nicely

9:28wanted you back and really like intensify my eyes or if I want to do a

2:12I'm just going to set my foundation and do my brows off camera which you can see
2:18how i do all that in my official face routine which is on my channel so i'll
2:22be like that
2:23all right now that my face is officially on let's get down to the look now
2:27because i'm going to be doing a lot of bright neon today i'm gonna be using the
2:31cat Mundy high voltage eyeshadow primer
2:35I love to apply this with back to 52 brush and i just use a . if you've ever
2:40used this before you know
2:42a little goes a long way with all of our products so I'm just gonna . my lid and
2:46then take this brush and start sweeping it all over
2:50so my knee and I shadows stay put and as always i'm going to sweep a little bit
2:56under the eye but not too much
2:59now we can get to our eye shadow now i'm gonna be using this busy our editorial
3:05eyeshadow palette this white color you guys I've used before
3:08this is my favorite is a nice and base for bright shadows and i'm going to be
3:13using this pink on this one
3:15and for the yellow i pulled out one of my old mac eyeshadow palette that I made
3:20myself so this yellow is called chrome yellow
3:23so we're going to be dipping into this color today as well with the same
3:25brushes my primer for i'm going to be going right to that matt white
3:31and I'm gonna highlight my brow bone with the shade and also put it online
3:38higher I area now notice how I am doing packing motions I want to pack this
3:44eyeshadow in so it does not leave me
3:47and we're going to pack pack pack all right now the first color I'm to be
3:51laying down
3:52is this bright pink now i'm gonna be using a more feet 4 11 brush to pack
3:58some of that in
3:59I'm gonna saturate this brush completely and then if you want to avoid fallout
4:03down
4:04now i'm going to start this look I'm gonna be doing three colors pink yellow
4:08pink i'm going to start this by just packing on the pink on the outside all
4:15the way to the lash line and then backing up a little bit
4:21and once again i'm doing a lot of tapping motions so it acts in that color
4:25and it has minimal fallout and this is just going to be our guide so this is
4:29not have to look perfect this is just to start
4:31look then we're going to take that pink then tuck it inside
4:39so notice how i'm leaving an area in the middle for that yellow color
4:44my eye doesn't look like a unicorn threw up on it in 10 minutes
4:49we don't have a fucking problem now to create this trifecta we're gonna pop a
4:53color right in the middle and start blending back and forth so i'm going to
4:57be using this morphy pulling that brush this doesn't have a number but it's from
5:01the bling collection
5:02I'm obsessed with this time like the present to eat it I'm going to saturate
5:06the brush so it's like me on on there and then we're just going to place it in
5:10the middle and you want to buffer it back and forth and really press it in
5:15there so it sticks and if you blend good enough it should turn a little bit
5:21orange around the corners so that pink and yellow are basically like getting
5:27married and having a baby in your eyelid and then you can take some color and
5:31start landing
5:33so if you're I does not look like a sunset by now you have some issue girl
5:39ok now to soften the lines up here we're going to be taking a mac 224 brush and
5:46we're going to dip into the pink and lightly merge the top together so i do
5:51not want this black raccoon rainbow I I want it to look very soft and pretty so
5:56we're just going to take a little bit of pink on this
5:59and follow the line that we've already created and just start blending up and
6:05just softening it now if you want to make the top even more blendable we go
6:11back in with that white color and we lightly go over the pink again and that
6:19looks very airbrush and I say Russia loss that's the effect that we're going
6:23when i add any darkness to my under eye i'm going to be taking this more feet
6:28e3 brush which by the way feels like velvet
6:31lowered and I'm gonna be taking this Laura Mercier pressed setting powder and
6:36I want to just place a little under my eyes
6:38so only reason why I'm doing this you haven't seen videos and other videos
6:41because I want to really smoke out the bottom and I don't want to deal with any
6:45fallout
6:45I was always going to be going in with my Mac smaller eye pencil this has been
6:49my favorite black eyeliner since like the beginning of time so I'm just going
6:54to take a damp Beauty Blender and as always
6:58slightly pull down so I'm not ruining the elasticity of my eyes and I'm just
7:05putting this directly in the water line doesn't have to be perfect we're going
7:08to smoke it out in a second
7:10now my eyes are very right so I do you want to create some darkness underneath
7:14so I'm gonna be using this on a stock see a shadow in shade of peacock
7:18it's like a force t jade green and I'm just gonna be taking this Mac - 19 brush
7:23and basically smudging the black out with the green on the brush
7:28BAM fallout is gone let's start blending i'm going to start from the inner corner
7:34and a lot of little small back and forth motions almost like i'm drawing and on
7:41and i'm just going to lightly start driving across the entire under I
7:51now notice how I'm taking it a little past my actual I so it gives it that
7:57really dramatic like I'm moment land
8:04yeah
8:09forward two latches and mascara i'm going to add i'm going to glitter in my
8:13inner corner and i found this glitter from lit cosmetics and it's called share
8:19chtr y'all not like I'm going to share a piece of candy we're talking to share
8:23the icon is like a silver rainbow just go like I don't know if I could have sex
8:30with the glitter i would definitely this one bowl tom ford eyeshadow brush and
8:35I'm just going to directly place this on lid and see how fucked up I get it now I
8:42know some of you are going to slap me in the face we're not using any glitter
8:45glue or adhesive and I'm just going direct from brush to face but it's
8:51staying on there

9:43placement

4:40big old man brush and I'm just going to go back in with that contour color and
4:45just chill out this chin a little bit for that define look and was going to
4:50soften that line with my Beauty Blender for the nose today I'm actually just
4:54going to take this brush and put a little product on it just half wait here
4:59and I'm just going to take it and run it down my nose where I want the color just
5:05a just a quick little to second notes job
5:08you will now I'm really defining the nose and I'm going to soften it in a
5:12second so if it looks a little too crazy
5:14you can always turn it down like this is for Valentine's so I want my nose like
5:19severe I don't want to break up with me because I didn't find her enough now
5:23that my nose looks crazy
5:25I'm going to take the Beauty Blender and just up over the line and just kind of
5:30soften them a little bit
5:31ok now let's get to the eyes
5:34all right now for eyes today I'm going to keep it really really simple like you
5:39guys are gonna be blown away how easy this is for Valentine's I want it to be
5:42really soft really pretty so I pulled out my too faced chocolate bonbon
5:47palette I love
5:48love this one first of all it's think so i'm already obsessed and oh that
5:53chocolate smell kills me
5:55I'm just going to dip into this color divinity which is a really light nude
5:59color and I'm just gonna take this from brow to lid and just coat my entire I
6:05with it
6:06we apply it is you smell the cocoa powder and you're like instantly hungry
6:09I'm like oh I want an ice cream sundae right now with a Cinnabon and strawberry
6:14lemonade
6:15oh my god now this color almost matches my skin tone which is exactly what I
6:20wanted
6:20it's just going to be a little base for us to get started make sure I shadows
6:24blend seamlessly
6:26all right now I'm just going to put a really soft brown color in the crease
6:30and I'm going to use my morphe 441 brush now the shade is called on the trouble
6:35right here
6:35it's like a really soft ma be brown I want to cut the brush completely and
6:40really get the color in there by and we're just going to tuck this into my
6:46crease and this is a really soft color
6:49we're going to be really gentle today I'm so used to seeing like bright colors
6:53are really bold right away I'm like oh like I'm not wearing anything
6:57my wrist is like bitch add more color all right now for the lid i'm going to
7:01use a metallic bronze color this is called molasses chip and this is this
7:06guy right here i'm going to just take my mac 217 brush and dip in there
7:12now usually with metallics like to wet the brush or a crazy effect let's see if
7:15this one wants to show up on my lid today
7:18oh I love that really soft
7:23all right now I'm gonna take this NARS eyeshadow
7:27it just came out and it's called turbos it's like this pretty minch like a
7:32greenish color I love and I'm actually going to add the screen color on the top
7:36of some of the brown just to give it some extra flavor and i'm going to just
7:40wet the brush always with my max plus now when you use these wet like they
7:45recommend it's like whoa
7:47so let's see what happens
7:49I live for a bitch and I'm just going to place it directly in the middle so I'm
7:56not doing my whole lid just the center now normally i would add a lot of
8:01darkness in my crease but i'm actually gonna not do that today
8:04oh god it was so weird all right now to soften those edges i'm going to be
8:08taking the same almond tropical color here and just popping over it and over
8:14it real quick
8:15all right now for under the eye i'm going to keep it really soft and gentle
8:19and i'm going to take this color in the palette called satin sheets
8:23it's like champagne the shimmery peachy
8:27I don't know it's just that's amazing i'm going to take my mac 239 brush the
8:31little guy and just dip in there
8:34I want to coat that whole brush and I'm just going to go right on the inner
8:37corner and add in that color and i'm going to bring it slightly down where
8:42it's a little bit under the eye
8:44just a little soft effect you know what's cool about these eyeshadows is
8:48you can actually use color as a highlight which I did the other day and
8:53it looked so pretty
8:54so there's ever anything metallic in your palate dip it in honey and pay
8:58those cheeks
9:01ok so now that that's done i'm just going to take that same with morphy 441
9:09brush and I'm gonna dip into this color one more time and I'm actually just
9:14going to take it under my eye and just lightly buff under it so just give you
9:20that soft brown
9:25and we're going to slightly drag that shadow out a little bit
9:29ok now what is going to make these eyes stand out really crazy i think is that
9:34mascara and the big lashes once you add those things to your eyes it always
9:39gives you that like oh ok
9:41there it is look all right now I'm gonna take my Too Faced better than sex
9:45mascara and coat the entire top and bottom before we do some lashes
9:52now let's do the lot of mascara
9:59now when you don't have a lot of dramatic eye shadow underneath he would
10:05be really careful not to bump your skin with a brush
10:08so I'm just going over this a few times so it's like extra tarantula
10:13now I want the latches to be the main focus of this luck since it's so soft
10:18and gentle so i'm going to be using the Buddha beauty
10:21Farrah lashes now it's time to put some lash glue on and get these bitches a
10:27warm

3:03going to be dipping into their morning
3:06let's start blending now I want this really light under my brow bone so
3:10obviously if you are not really pale like me use a color that little more to
3:14your skin tone
3:15this one can be really harsh but i'm going for that doll like effect today
3:21do you guys ever have this moment where you kind of like you're right eyebrow
3:25more than left
3:26now listen when you have to draw him on every single day and try to match them
3:30sometimes i like the right one a little more and that's definitely happening
3:33today
3:35now i'm going to do is some warm tone little smoky neon drama in my crease
3:41before we try out that liner and i'm going to be starting off with my violet
3:46of Oz holy grail palette i have been using this so much off camera
3:50like what I've been going out lately to events and stuff I've really been
3:53obsessed with this one high hashtag is like a godsend so we're gonna be dipping
3:58into that one today
3:59the fuck brushes this is the mac 217 I'm going to coat my entire brush
4:03BAM off this is such a good warm neutral color
4:07literally my new favorite so then i'm also going to take some and bring it a
4:12little bit down on the lash line and understanding really soft and gentle and
4:16dragging it out now that this transition color is laid down
4:22I'm going to dip into my melt cosmetics radioactive eyeshadow stack these are so
4:27pretty
4:28oh hi good morning the shade is called radon and i am going to be placing this
4:35right over what we just did and i'm going to start on just that this half of
4:40my eyes so just the outer edges or corners and that white shadow should
4:45really help to blend this and make it look pretty but a dip into that Lauren
4:49I'm actually gonna bring it down
4:50I just love the wait neons look blend it out
4:54so I'm actually going to bring it and even more so this is really going to
4:57give us that plastic doll like appearance with that really dramatic
5:02like who
5:04hi now i'm going to go back into this palette and dip into this beautiful warm
5:08chocolate brown shade is called Islander and i'm going to take this little mac -
5:1221 in detail brush and I'm just going to add and a little bit of warmth and depth
5:18to my crease really lights almost like we are doing surgery let me lift up my
5:23head a little bit
5:25now there will be light are going there so I'm not going to connect it if you're
5:28like bitch what the hell time to drive assistant Lee eyeliner we're going to
5:31put it to the test
5:33we're gonna give it a world
5:36all right now i'm going to start dragging the wing
5:42now i will say this liner does have a lot of pigment usually by now have to
5:47like shake and twirl and try to get more pigment out but this that keeps on
5:52coming out
5:53I'm surprised the eyeliner keeps on coming it's kind of like my last bukkake
5:57it's just not stopping
5:58and i still this still has pigment maybe because it's holding it down and it's
6:02like seeping into the applicator which would be genius
6:05hi but uh this is still full of liner like it's not stopping
6:17one side and down one to go
6:22who she's take the wheel alright guys we finally hit our first snag the ink is
6:28drying out where the liner excuse me and it is getting kind of hard to use this
6:36is not acceptable
6:38it is drying up a little bit so i'm going to close it
6:41give it a minute and we're back ok so basically we had to shake it and twirl
6:48it and now we're back
6:50ok alright so let's finish this I so I want to see how this is gonna wear
6:55throughout the day but so far
6:57who I'm like I like it I like it a lot
7:01first impressions it's black it's great full coverage and I need a full coverage
7:06liner
7:07now it does it beat the kat von d liner it has its pros and cons this brush is
7:12bigger and I felt like I could do the top part quicker but kind of the same so
7:17do i think it's worth seventy dollars up
7:20not really sorry I was so high on LSD i forgot to put my white liner on
7:25so I'm going to take my mac fascinating as always and we're just going to paint
7:29that water line
7:31ghost white but be careful it doesn't touch the black liner it will turn gray
7:35and I don't want to grab my water
7:38once that whites in their bitch it's over it's like I game changer
7:42now today before my lashes i'm going to try a new mascara as well
7:46this is that nor couture black satin mascara
7:50now listen this kind of looks like the top of my packaging so I was obviously
7:54drawn in by the Stars this component is really cute
7:58now here's what got me when I saw this bullshit at the mall y'all see that
8:02ok so we're going to give it a world today I'd never use this brand-new fresh
8:06out the tube
8:07so let's try it together I don't know how that you're supposed to use this but
8:11let's try
8:12no not really seeing that much of a difference here
8:16definitely not all no not really loving this one in the drawer she goes now
8:23Sicily same brand as the liner
8:26they have any mascara how you got that this week today I haven't tried it this
8:30is the so curl deep black mascara love this cute little too but now the brush
8:37has a slight little angle
8:39ok q let's try this one
8:42oh wow okay already uplifting now
8:45not that this is like a huge huge difference but it definitely lifted my
8:51lashes more like on this side of definitely didn't know now bottom
8:56mascara is very key with this look because we are doing no shadow I know it
9:00breaks my heart as well it's really weird but I feel like if you have no
9:04shadow without white liner it's very uplifting and very mannequin like so I'm
9:09gonna hoping prince was not fuck up my bottom lashes or twice call me a problem
9:15now today for false lashes i'm gonna be using the hood of beauty
9:22Farrah mmm these 3d foam inks girl
9:26now when I talked a few videos ago about lash glue and how i hated smell you guys
9:32like overwhelmingly sent me thousands of tweets and snapchat about the house of
9:39lashes glue and now he said it smelled amazing and it was really good and held
9:42on my inner corners so so pleasant
9:48I've tried this over the last few days it does really work great shout out to
9:53house of lashes hi love you and we're just going to paint that entire lash and

10:57bam bam that's all you need girl and I'm just going to place this right above my
11:03contour
11:05this is so pretty it is like a light golden yellow
11:12oh you see that mm like hmm where else am I going to put this the Cupid's bow
11:16duh being can you see me now
11:19now that I'm blinding everybody let's get down to the lips her lips today I'm
11:24going to kind of a classic nineties nude lip I'm going to start by using this mac
11:28lip liner in shade hover and i'm just going to outline my entire lives
11:39so I'm kind of creating a little ombre effect already
11:42by just taking a pencil and just kind of looking up really lightly so it just
11:46gives it the more soft appearance while giving you a harsh darker line down here
11:51all right we are live line but now for lipstick today I'm gonna be pulling out
11:57a little christian louboutin
11:59if you've never seen this packaging oh I mean this a full-blooded Instagram and
12:04when my favorite shoe brand create a lipstick I about died so i picked one of
12:09the mat nude shades hi packaging is amazing
12:13good morning now i'm just gonna take it out of the packaging
12:16you just have to unscrew the top off and it comes out
12:20hi this looks like a Christmas ornament or it could be a butt plug
12:25the packaging is genius expensive it feels amazing
12:29now this shade is called to tell i'm not sure how you say that I think it's
12:34French so there
12:35that this shade is such a pretty gorgeous nude
12:41let's try it oh I'm dying I don't need more of just applying more because it
12:45just feels so damn good
12:48this is such like a pretty everyday color
12:51now I like to do is I'll go back in with the lip pencil and i will just cut a
12:57lightly go over the lines again just so you keep that kind of our great fact now
13:04I think the only thing that is stopping me from being done is a little setting
13:09spray and a damn winged now besides using my favorite Urban Decay all
13:13nighter
13:14I found something new at the mall now heals the skin care i have loved and
13:19adored for a really long time you have some really good night creams

1:20I . covers your entire lid so do not over use this product and I like to take
1:26a little primer from the excess of the brush and just kind of sweep it under my
1:30eyes
1:31all right let's get started with the eyeshadow as always i'm going to take a
1:35really light eyeshadow and put it from the brow all the way to my lash line and
1:41today i'm gonna be using this really white color it is like pure coke and
1:45this is from the busy art 08 editorial palette i love this one if you've never
1:49tried this brand
1:50bitch you missing out because this shit blend like coffee cream
1:55now you all know I like to go all the way to the brow bone
1:59so as i get up top I'm going to blend out this shade
2:03all right now let's move on to some Purple's now to start off I'm going to
2:11be using makeup east high wire with this Mac - 19 brush now I love these .
2:17brushes because they easily get in the corners so I'm going to just start
2:23packing it on the bottom corner and I on the top
2:28let's dampen this little bit ok what's up silver and i'm just going to pack and
2:35pack and pack this on all right now it's time to start adding in the purple
2:42we're going to start laying down the foundation of our purple
2:45I with Kaitlyn rose
2:48now I love to saturate my brush completely before i start and then I'll
2:52not go all out by now I'm gonna bring this purple all the way down to the lash
3:01line
3:02just a little bit here what kind of creates a c-like movement
3:08all right now we're going to stop in these harsh edges on the top
3:12we're going to be dipping into mess created a shadow
3:16now i'm just going to take this on the brush and I'm gonna go over what I've
3:20already done and just start dragging it up so it just gives you that more
3:25airbrushed appearance and really nice soft landing
3:29notice how I'm bringing it a little bit down on my nose
3:32now i'm going to go back with that light color from this palette and i'll be
3:37going back and forth and just blending and buffing it out until it looks super
3:41airbrush
3:46now I'm gonna be taking max smaller eye pencil and i'm going to be just putting
3:50black in my waterline and we're going to use that to pop down and mix purple
3:55shadow so we get that really grungy smoky eye
3:57we don't take the Beauty Blender we're going to lightly just pull really light
4:01you guys
4:04now this is not have to be perfect as we are going to blend over it basically so
4:10long as the water line looks good you're good

4:17going to be using this Tom 414
4:20I shadow brush and we're going to be mixing in Kaitlyn rose from makeup geek
4:24with the busy arch shade down here
4:27now this is like a purple with our little red undertone
4:31I love it I'm going to different at first then we're going to go back in
4:34here and we're going to dip in so my brush basically has two colors on it
4:39I'm just going to start popping and dragging this over the black liner and
4:45using it just smudge it out and create some purple amazingness
4:51now i'm even going over a little bit of the silver just so it mixes in with the
4:56purple so it stays looking really smoke down but then as a purple effect to it
5:01and now I'm going to take that staying back to 24 blending brush and we're just
5:06going to take a little bit on here
5:08get rid of that fall out and I'm just gonna put it right in the ER and blend
5:15and mix those together so it looks really a brushed
5:19now i'm using a lot of purple I'm trying to get my eyes to look exactly like
5:26promethazine codeine mix with Barney having five children

0:59I haven't really like a full face glam in a second so today we're going to be
1:03utilizing the beauty killer palette for the eyes but I'm gonna do a little fast
1:07forward and show you guys that face routine just in case you don't need a
1:11little refresher
1:12so today I'm actually gonna go back in with my law / a foundation now I
1:16reviewed this a few weeks ago to know a lot of your like having anyone and it's
1:20actually really really dope so i'm going to apply a lot of this on and i'm gonna
1:25be using my artiste overall a brush
1:28I'm obsessed with these brushes like I'm just going to take this out of the thing
1:33hi spatula and just like last time i was going to paint them on you know me I
1:37like to go really overboard me overboard
1:40never now I didn't build this up last time i used it and off camera i've been
1:46wearing a lot and it's just really pretty it has this like luminosity to it
1:51that most foundations do not have come on forehead and
1:56and bam all you do is you're going to take this brush and you're just gonna
1:59brush it around your skin and it literally covers it
2:04wick like oh hi hi left side of my face you already done and you're just gonna
2:09massage it into your skin and brush it on
2:14oh we just have a moment of silence for how good the shit smiles I'm just like
2:17all right now
2:20the concealer that was in this guy-- it's a little too heavy for me under my
2:23eyes I don't like to cake on all that makeup
2:26I don't really need it myself so I'm just going to go back to my old school
2:30jeffree star method I've coating my entire face with Studio Fix so we find a
2:35big old brush my favorite powder brushes is Tom 405 brush it's just like it's
2:41perfect so we're going to dip into this guy and cover my entire mug
2:45so we're just creating a really mannequin like masks today if you don't
2:49need as much foundation just fast forward but if you do
2:53pause and apply it with me and notice how I'm kind of like smashing the brush
2:57into my face
2:58I am packing it on a much just kind of like aa girl
3:03you can't do that you gotta pack it into the skin because we are not going to be
3:07touching up later we are too busy for that we got too much way too small too
3:12many dicks to suck and we got too many shopping trips to do so we're going to
3:16hack it and pack it on and of course we're not going to forget our neck
3:21we're going to avoid grandma was that girl and we're going to adjust our ears
3:24ever so slightly
3:25all right now highlight and contour an old-school trick that I've been doing
3:29since the myspace days is I found this mac studio fix it is literally ghost
3:34white
3:35so instead of packing on all that concealer under the eyes which I don't
3:38really need it all the time i'm just going to take this little nars kabuki
3:41brush and I just like to buff this under my eyes almost like a little upside down
3:47like triangle motion we're gonna bring it all the way to my hairline
3:51because I do like that extreme glamour and we're just gonna stuff it under and
3:56blend it in
3:58just really get that in there and that will ensure it does not move throughout
4:02the day
4:03now other areas that I do love to highlight because i'd like to look very
4:07plastic
4:08I love doing a little bit on the chin haha no chickens been a minute how you
4:13doing girl how's your morning
4:15all right now we're highlighting the gods it's time to contour the space a
4:17little bit
4:18now i'm going to try something today we're don't go with severe huh
4:21I know I I couldn't do that came out of my mouth either but I'm just trying to
4:26look today so I'm gonna be using my little Chanel foundation bronzer brush
4:29I love the sky it's like airbrush on a stick and hi kat von d how are you I'm
4:34just gonna dip into that middle one and just got lightly on the darker one and
4:38I'm just gonna just chill these cheeks a little bit
4:41hmm now i'm just going to do a little circular but emotions and i'm only going
4:45to do my contoured here today usually you guys my love to go all the way down
4:48but i'm just gonna softly do it this way today I just see how i like it if I hate
4:53it great
4:53cool thing about makeup is it washes off and you can have new cheekbones tomorrow
4:57so lets buff out this face forehead nose and chin and pray that we look cute
5:03she's going dark on that for today girl
5:08you know what them wigs got a really great that dimension where bronze buffed
5:13and beautiful now I guess it's a time for some eyebrows
5:17just kidding i forgot my nose mother effer
5:21and now we're going to breathe through these averages using on it starts at
5:25beverly hills dipbrow and brow ways
5:38alright browser on now let's get to these eyes now today i'm going to create
5:44a little go to easy look that i am going to show you mah
5:49oh my war oh my today i'm going to show you a little quick go to look using that
5:59beauty killer palette
6:00oh now you can tell them really obsessed with China white here because the j in
6:04the pan is like the exchange this is like my go-to I talked about this in the
6:09swatch video i have been putting a light color shadow under my brow bone
6:14since the dawn of time so I'm just going to take China white and just bring it
6:19all the way down and i'm just going to coat my entire lid from lash to brow
6:25bone a whole damn thing
6:27now I cast a lot why use a really light shadow of course you can use your
6:31favorite primer which I do do that sometimes but when you're using any
6:34other bright or dark colors this easily blend it out if you didn't have anything
6:39already down there so this is kind of like my primer i guess you could call it
6:43and we're just going to take China white and just butt hurt the gods
6:47now i'm going to take this mac low 22 for blending brush we're going to get
6:50right into Kourtney and this is going to be our transition color this is really
6:54easy
6:55everyone should be able to use this color and we're just going to pop this
6:58right in my crease
7:00it's an easy transition color I think anyone can pull this off
7:03it's going to help you blend out your other shadows or you can literally just
7:06wear this in your crease and pop a lash on and get ready for the day since i
7:11have no eyebrows
7:13I like to be a little bit more dramatic with my shadow so of course if this is
7:17too much for you can tailor and tone it down to fit your needs but i just love
7:21Courtney it's such an easy color it's like if you want to stop from those
7:25edges you can dip back into trying to wait just a little . on your little
7:28blending brush and you can just going to go over the edges and just soften them
7:33out so they look really soft and pretty
7:35i'm really loving and vanity so I want to dip that in
7:39and create kind of a little deep socket in there and I have a special surprise
7:43for you guys ready for the surprise because this isn't even in the
7:46description is the name of the title but i'm going to debut it here for you guys
7:50so I have a collab coming out with morphe brushes yes i am obsessed with
7:55that you guys know how to use them in all my videos I'm going to show you a
7:58little sneak peek of a few of them should we do it should be doing ok we're
8:02doing it
8:03BAM oh this is the first time I'm like really ever showing these and a little
8:07sneak peek on Instagram and these are just four of ten brushes coming out they
8:12are pink
8:13chrome they have the logo on it and the morphe brush logo sorry my lighting is
8:18so it's too pretty it's like not showing my Legos
8:21they are vegan cruelty free and they're so soft now I know a lot of people are
8:27vegan brushes can be a little rough business jeffree star you know the shit
8:29was like I it was good
8:33so I'm gonna be using been minus one more P jeffree star automatic sprinkler
8:37brush and we're going to dip into vanity
8:39I created brushes that only i would use obviously not going to create something
8:43that I would not use on myself so we're just going to dip into this and of
8:47course will do a full reveal with all the brushes soon for a video but i had
8:52to give you guys a little sneak be sleepy so i'm gonna talk vanity right in
8:56my crease and just very own just put her right in there
9:00now i am going to keep my eye makeup really minimal today so this define
9:04crease is detrimental and I'm not going to bring it all the way down my nose to
9:08see how I look this way I look down I just gonna stopped it where the socket
9:12meats and i'm just going to drag and blend it out a little more
9:16yes blending brush feel so soft and it's not like it's a Christmas pie
9:22it's all right now for this lid color notice how i did leave some room right
9:25here i want to pop in some gold now you can put the gold in the middle you can
9:29put it on the corners i don't know what i want to do yet but I'm going to be
9:32dipping into rich bitch with a little synthetic flat brush and I'm going to
9:36coat the entire back and front of this
9:39I don't know where I want to place it yet let's just give it a whirl
9:44and see what happens that brush is a little too small so i swapped it out for
9:48one of my blending brushes and i'm just going to pack this on the lid
9:52oh it is so pretty and I'm gonna put it right below vanity and mm just get a
9:58little schoolgirl
9:59hmm now a little cute trick if you want to wet the brush with your fixed plus it
10:04will make the pigment really stand out so if you want extreme pigment i would
10:09definitely wet the brush a little bit now notice how I'm in it tuck this into
10:14here but not bring it all the way up so I'm just going to kind of bring it down
10:17right there and that's it now for under the eyes you can do really anything you
10:22want a lot of times i like to leave it minimal and not really do much but today
10:27I'm gonna kind of smoke it out because they keep putting in like white or nude
10:32eyeliner on my waterline so I want to give it a little bit of depth today I'm
10:36just going to pop in this max moulder in my waterline
10:40and there we go really thinly and they're not too crazy and i'm using my
10:45Beauty Blender to pull down my lid so I'm not tagging and making myself look a

1:40and enjoy this look
1:41now just start i'm actually going to leave no brows today
1:45now that i have is amazing bangs I don't browse so we're gonna stick to the very
1:50goth alien jeffree star 10th grade look at how you used to do and to start this
1:56i'm going to coat my entire lid with a white skin color based and today i'm
2:00gonna be using the new Kat Von D shade and light contour quad who is a mouthful
2:07and this is the rust palette I love her new packaging like
2:11hi this is very high
2:12and and these are the four colors that come with it these are not often enough
2:16so we're just going to stick with this light one today just for the base and
2:19then we'll move on to a different palette but let's see if these are
2:22pigment did
2:23oh I and hi cat never fails to deliver so I am already excited
2:30both the entire lid and i'm actually gonna bring the shadow up all the way
2:34and i'm going to take this and pull it all the way back so it would be a lot
2:40easier to blend later
2:42google pastel god there is a different like variation of the looks that
2:46everybody gives it's like mainly a dark lip and kind of light eyes or sometimes
2:50it's like a pastel and really dark
2:52I'm going to give it a little Jeffrey twist and i'm going to dive into this
2:55sugarpill heartbreaker palette and we're going to go riding with this hot glue
2:58called velocity over my lower they are really highly pigmented you touch your
3:04brush once oh good morning and they're ready to play
3:08so I'm going to using my Chanel eyeshadow my blending brush
3:11I love this one and I'm just gonna dive in and start sketching out a little bit
3:17of a crease
3:18if you want you can stretch it out a little higher
3:21or you can stick to your natural crease line
3:25I have no brows I have a little bit more room to play with and I'm definitely
3:28going to be banking on that today so i'm going to take this and since i have no
3:33brows i want to create a long like them and definition to the eyes
3:38i'm going to be taking the shadow
3:39I'm going all the way
3:42and then we're going to drag and this doesn't have to look perfect because we
3:45are going to use another brush to blend up but the base shadow that we
3:49previously just applied is definitely going to help blend everything out
3:53already so I think you all right now i'm going to drag that all the way down to
3:59my lash line
4:00just a little bit in there notice i'm leaving some room for color right here
4:04and color right there i'm going to add into more colors actually so you don't
4:08want to take the blue too far and just kind of doing a half way into my eyelid
4:13and of course we'll puff and blend out that better
4:16so no worries today we're gonna be pulling up this makeup gem this is that
4:20Natasha day Nona palette it's one of the palette she has like a million these
4:24common way you know just like you know one or two shades good morning so I'm
4:29looking at this palette clearly this one this one and this one it needs to get
4:33all on this face so first we take this sky blue amazing this and i'm gonna be
4:38using that sugar pill blending eyeshadow brush and I'm just gonna be dipping into
4:43that one
4:44all right now I'm going to take that color
4:46merge it with that darker one that we just put on and i'm just going to kind
4:51of blend up and out
4:53I'm gonna merge those two and use it as a lending color and then we're going to
4:58go back in with our first blending brush with a little extra product of that cat
5:02palette and we're just gonna blend
5:05come on sky blue and this is where i'm going to drag it out a little bit more
5:09and blue and an o.d yeah i'm going to add in a little pop of colors so I mean
5:15look there are so many options i'm looking down on all these eyeshadows and
5:19I'm just like why did you do this to me why
5:22now there's this really pretty cyborg foiled silver
5:27now I've used this once before and I wedded the brush
5:30I wet the brush when it went better fucking whatever i'm going to use my mac
5:35fix+ this is the lavender flavor and I'm just gonna coat this Bobby Brown little
5:40blending brush and we're just going to dip into that silver and oh my god it's
5:46like whoo
5:47all right we're just going to take that silver right on the lid
5:52yes and just start packing that in there
5:56now if you don't let the brush you might not get the desired intensity that you
6:00want so i definitely recommend doing that and I'm going to take it all the
6:05way down now we are going to blend out this part a little bit in a second so if
6:09you're like girl that was a little janky
6:11I am definitely not done and because my sockets are so big i'm actually going to
6:16bring that silver all the way to my
6:19like nose basically in there and see that my turn to the side it looks so
6:24pretty
6:24now my lids don't look like Terminator I fucked me
6:28then we just didn't do it enough so i'm going to keep layering and layering now
6:32that the silver is down
6:33I definitely need to go in and blend out a little more
6:37so we're just going to go back with their first blue I like to press a
6:41little bit around the edges of where that silver was so we're just kind of
6:45having emerged become besties or you know lovers
6:49whichever way you guys want to do it now - adding a little bit of death and drama
6:54I'm gonna get going in with this really dark dark blue shade in here and i'm
6:58actually going to touch this little duochrome moment right here i'm going to
7:01take the dark blue actually and do a little bit under my eyes as well let's
7:06do the crease first so I was taking a little mac 217 and that dark blue is so
7:12big and it like you really got to be careful so I'm going to be really
7:16delicate and start tucking that dark color a little bit in there
7:22this is for depth and drama if you want it a little lighter just skip this part
7:27but I'm gonna take that sugar pill brush one more time and just help blend and
7:31blend all right actually switched my idea so I did the darkness on here with
7:36my crease and then
7:38I'm like going to add even more color I think it's pretty good for now until we
7:42do lashes for the top i'm like okay i'm loving this
7:45it's very like alien cyborgs sky blue
7:49like I don't even know Titanic drowning sexy i don't know what the fuck I'm
7:54saying but you guys get the drift I'm loving it let's move to under my eyes
7:59okay so i was looking at all my makeup trying to find a good paint and of
8:03course I pull up more sugar bill this is the pro palette you can usually get
8:07these at like the imap makeup trade shows or that type of thing I don't
8:11think they sell them online
8:12but there's a pink in there right there and I'm like ooh girl
8:15so we're going to dip into that and i'm also going to do a little more inner
8:18corner under and I found this
8:21inglot pigment eyeshadow it is so pretty
8:24so i am going to give that a world today and i'm going to be using my little mac
8:29- 19 pointy brush
8:31I know what I don't normally use inglot a lot on my channel but i am obsessed
8:35with this pigment so once again we're going to let that brush a little bit and
8:40I like to just pour some of the pigment into the cap like so so I'm just going
8:44to take this and put it right at the inner corner
8:48oh my god and gagging this is so pretty
8:52this is the definition of like has to drop
8:55I'm being really delicate as usual and barely touching my skin
9:00imagine this is like a highlight on my cheek who I might have to do that like
9:05every day now and because I have OCD and glitter obsession
9:10I'm just going back over and over honestly I think one layers and
9:14but this is the jeffrey show here we're going to do like 16 layers
9:18all right now we're going to dip into that sugar Belle paint with the exact
9:21same brush let's keep it moving in and I'm just gonna continue to drag this out
9:28now this pink is very think so
9:31be careful we're just going to merge these two together and notice how i'm
9:35not going to go all the way because i am going to take that dark blue that we put
9:38in my crease the second ago and we are going to bring a little bit of that down
9:41so i'm not gonna do the entire thing
9:44oh my god that's like Pinker the papacy ok now the pink is laid down my cock in
9:50with this really really dark blue and i'm going to be using this little more
9:54the five of seven brush a little detailer what's up girl
9:58I love this little guy so we're just gonna really lightly start in there and
10:03I'm going to take the start
10:04blue and just merge it with that pink really thin
10:09like we want this under I to look like a cotton candy
10:13orgasm you want these eyeshadows to merge together so it should create a
10:17little kind of purple moment which is what happens with blue and pink get to
10:22get there
10:23hi color wheel all right now I'm not going to do a wing for this look but i
10:27am going to smudge a little black liner where the lashes are going to go i think
10:31there's so much color going on here
10:33it just needs a little bit of depth so I'm going to take my mac smolder pencil
10:36and I'm just gonna really lightly like we're talking barely there so I'm just
10:41going to kind of tight line in there
10:42so really minimal that is now obviously it's not so much yet somebody's my
10:46little more feet
10:47508 brush I love this and i'm just going to take that and smudge out that top
10:53liner just a hair
10:55all right now before we do mascara and latches
10:59i'm going to do some white eyeliner and you're like oh my god so more liner girl
11:03we are not done this is an intricate little look so we're going to take max
11:06fascinating white pencil this is my favorite for the waterline who are going
11:11to hold your breath and just get through this one real quick if you hit your
11:14waterline
11:15so we're going to take this pencil and we're just gonna put it right in the
11:19water line now because of all these bright colors you've got to be careful
11:22because this liner gonna hug on to color as well
11:25like take it and turn like pink so you've got to be really careful now I
11:30think this really completes the look
11:33it's like that extra subtlety all right now for lashes you definitely want to
11:38look like adults so we're going to first coat or latches with the new to face
11:42waterproof better than sex
11:44oh my god I told you guys I had been waiting to try this this is one of my
11:48favorite mascaras
11:49so let's see what happens a same amazing once before
11:54let's see how this works now I got so excited I blinked and got mascara under
12:01my eye so i'm just going to use a little primer to wipe it off camera i'll be
12:06back in two seconds
12:07all right i did my whole entire mascara off camera actually got it on my hair
12:12like a girl was having a moment when slow deep breath and I got too excited
12:17and got it all over myself so mascara is on now it's time for lashes

1:13amazing if you guys do not know what that surgery is about look at my
1:17instagram i talked about it and give you a whole spiel
1:20but a long story short I got a whole new hair line and it takes months for the
1:24hair to grow obviously full and long again so i'm gonna be pushing my hair
1:29color and every video so I hope you enjoy this blonde bombshell moment and
1:33keep watching
1:35let's get started so as you can see I've already done my foundation and contour
1:40and powder highlights so if you want to see how we do that
1:43go back to my channel and find the official jeffree star face routine video
1:48all right now to get this crazy neon smokiness i'm going to use the lightest
1:54shade from the Kat Von D shade + light eye palette i'm going to be using the
1:58best guy today and I'm just going to take my mac to 52 as always my go-to
2:06and we're going to take that white color coat the entire bristles and then you
2:13guys know what I'd love to do it take that highlight right under the brow and
2:19just start blending down now I know a lot of you left to prime i do prime my
2:26lids sometimes but since I've been doing makeup
2:29I always just take a light color and bring it all the way down so it's kind
2:33of my primer love to take the shadow and bring it all the way past the brows so
2:40all the way there
2:42once it hits my face tattoo I know I'm good
2:46who hey all right now let's start putting some neon colors on i'm going to
2:52go to one of my go-to favorites is that Urban Decay electric palette i love this
2:56one
2:57now it says that a few of the shades or not I save and a lot of you're probably
3:01like really read the unit carton on this it says that some of the shades are not
3:07I say
3:07meaning that there's some dyes that they used in their formula that may stay in
3:13the lids so I personally do not care i know my eyelids are not going to fall
3:16off and then I don't mind looking like i had pink eye for a few days because i
3:21just put foundation right over it so going to make a little cut crease type
3:24of moment with my eyes i'm going to be using the occ cosmetics color pencil in
3:31shade animate this is what I used for my pink browse and a few of my last videos
3:35so what this i'm actually going to sketch out my lid of where I'm gonna now
3:42draw it on
3:43so this is like an old-school trick I used to do back in the j
3:48so basically just sketching out where i'm going to draw and I like to bring
3:53the pencil all the way down in
3:56my water and bring it a little outside the line now this is obviously not
4:01supposed to look perfect such as like a little sketch that we're going to be a
4:04shadow on top of so don't think like damn bitch you look a messy so that's my
4:09little sketch
4:10q now i'm going to take this chanel eyeshadow blender sounds like really
4:14don't mean I'm gonna take some pink eyeshadow from this palette
4:19we're going to do shade savage which is this pink eye right here and I'm just
4:23going to coat the entire brush like so high by fall out
4:28we're actually going to take this brush and go over that line that i created and
4:33this is where you're going to buff it out and blends so force that line was
4:37definitely not perfect it was just more so to be a guide
4:42just guide me through this girl and I like to take this make it go all the way
4:46down the nose a little very airbrushed
4:49hello eighties makeup how are you and i'm just going to start buffing up
4:54so notice how i was doing little back and forth motions to give it that really
4:58nice
4:58airbrushed look that I have been known for forever
5:03we're just going to go up and up so just soft little brush motor like emotions
5:07and we're blending and blending and blending i'm going to take the shadow
5:11brush and dab it on my lid so it kind of creates that like halo half see type of
5:18moment and we're just going to go back and forth so this is like the foundation
5:22of the neon pink like she's getting there
5:25we're going to add in some more depth but this is just like the outline
5:28ok so then I'm going to take that first blending brush and without any extra
5:32product i'm just gonna kind of buff over the pink at the top edges just so it
5:37gives it a really nice
5:38blendy look before we go in with even more color
5:43all right now we're going to go in with this orange color is called a slow burn
5:48I and i love this one it really complements this one so I'm just going
5:52to dip it in and i'm gonna be using a little blending brush from Gucci i'm
5:56obsessed with these bristles they're so soft it feels like i don't know i don't
6:01even know what it feels like it just makes my eyelids come now these do have
6:05a little bit of fallout so high then we're just going to go in the middle now
6:09you don't have to necessarily do this perfect there's no like way to put on
6:14the orange I was kind of blending it in with the pink and dragging up
6:18unlike that outside so notice how the orange will not go in its just going to
6:22go on the outsides
6:24I want to give it some dimension and get my I some death
6:27so I'm just going to put that orange almost over the pink and it kind of
6:30creates a custom color and then drag it out even more since I we have no brows
6:35we can do whatever we want and just bring it all the way out
6:39love it so it's good it's kind of like a little sunset ombre moment and then if
6:43you want you can go back in with your first blending brush open up that cattle
6:49in G and take that light color one more time
6:52I just put a little bit on the brush and then we're going to go over that one
6:56more time and make sure it looks like I everything is airbrush now before i do
7:02all that smoky drama and make my eyes i am going to do a little wing and i'm
7:06gonna be using the kat von d liquid liner in trooper
7:10now I love this you just give it a little shake and the applicator is
7:13genius it's really fine and thin like hmm
7:17so I'm literally just going to take this and start painting and all that wing now
7:23I like to go from the middle and kind of create my shape and then I'll go down
7:28and start mapping it out but I love this pencil because it's a really cool way so
7:33if you were like on the go
7:35I have to go to business meeting and then you know to an orgy
7:38this one is definitely something you want to invest in
7:42now a lot of the times with liner i will take a mirror and get really close in
7:48there and just kind of go for it because sometimes the vanity mirrors are not
7:54good enough
7:56now what I'm doing this you guys
8:02I hope my breath so excuse the silence
8:11yes eyeliner
8:15let's get to smoking at the bottom and i don't mean crack cocaine
8:18I grabbed my trusting max smolder pencil and I'm just gonna slowly drag it in the
8:26water line now this liner is perfect for smudging if you want 24-hour stay liner
8:33this is not it this is for purposes of smudging out the bottom and making them
8:37look like heaven so we're just gonna put a little bit on the waterline you want
8:42to drive down too much because it might smear
8:46now for the bottom i'm going to take my mac - 19 pencil branch pipe n soul and
8:52I'm gonna take this shadow called urban it's this one is this hot purple like
8:56Omar growing i love this purple color
8:58so usually when you find a purple from any brand it's not good like it doesn't
9:02show up
9:03good enough but this one oh my god
9:06so I coat the entire brush like she's pigmented and I'm just gonna take this
9:11and start to drag it so i take the pencil brush and I start putting the
9:16shadow over that black and I'm really careful it's almost like we're doing
9:21surgery and I just start dragging it across
9:25now we're going to use another brush in a second but this like really gets it
9:29defined and it depends on how dramatic you want you can really bring it down
9:33like I am or you can share it down a little more it's up to you
9:37I'm always like go bold or go home
9:41then I'll take a little bit out with that wing and kind of mix in with the
9:44orange so we're like we're taking it there and then we're going to take the
9:48more feet 5 14 it's like a little detail brush and I'm going to dip it into that
9:52purple but i'm also going to take the next one called jilted right here and
9:58I'm just going to dab that on top of it so when i buffed out kind of gives it a
10:03little more depth a little more like
10:05oh hey and i'm just going to take it right over the purple and just slowly
10:09drag it across
10:11so this will soften all those harsh edges and just kind of give it a more
10:15defined luck
10:17just a little high-fashion Couture if you will now i'm just going back in one
10:21more time with the kat von d trooper liner
10:23I'm just kind of merging my corners of my eyes together so they look cohesive
10:29and like they're all one unit just tiny little details that I like to do and
10:35then I'm gonna take that urban decay jilted shade one more time with this
10:39morphe brush and just really smoke it out so it's like who lowered
10:45now what what is left with his eye
10:48besides lashes i think we are good i wasn't add some silver but i like the
10:54way that light shade is still on my lid i didn't really put another color there
11:00and i like that so i'm actually gonna go back in with that light shade right here
11:04and I'm just gonna add a little bit of it in here so it's like extra whoo
11:12hi good morning want to go in with my benefit roller lash
11:16I still can't get over this i got just I love it if you have tried this mascara
11:22let me know in the comments below if you love it i love this applicator

11:31oh right come thru bottom mascara I think it's really important it's like to
11:36me

11:51I will brush a little calm through this is a little off
11:54morphy 22 mascara home and always going to calm it down because when you get

12:34gonna go with the entire lash band

13:58a little bit of color to my cheeks i know i normally stay away from blush but
14:03I feel like with this look a little bit

1:17now let's talk about skin care for a second i have tried to not age for about
1:2215 years now and I mean I can say I've done a pretty good job of trying to like
1:26just stay away from the central together so I don't know why people leave the
1:29house and it'll hold umbrellas over their head and they don't wear 20 layers
1:33of sunscreen but I'm not normal
1:35first to prep the skin a bit of using that Georgia or money
1:38maestro UV primer now the cool thing about this
1:41yes you can really read that SPF 50 and that is not a lie
1:46it really does have that so I like to shake this guy and as like a dropper and
1:50i'm just going to put some
1:51all over my fingers like how i was going to attach the dropper and you're just
1:55gonna blend it into your skin
1:58ok so we have our sunscreen on now of course what are we gonna do we're gonna
2:02do a little bit more primer and i'm gonna be using that girl and L ' so our
2:07I never know how to pronounce this and everyone tries to read me for it so this
2:11one does have real gold flakes in it
2:14we are going to be a little Civil BAM on the cheeks

2:31do it in y'all I'm feeling a little luminous silk foundation I mean it's

2:39foundation that has SPF and this is by the mayor this is called the treatment
2:44fluid foundation and it's a little darker than my usual color so I like to
2:48mix it and just give me a little little added warmth the little summer glow
2:51little tan
2:53we're going to use the back of our hand just do a little one two three and then
2:56we're going to take that the mayor and we're going to do a little one too and
3:01that is enough to cover your entire face neck ears chest and mouth
3:05obviously you guys know I have my damp Beauty Blender on standby but i think

8:25involved there's no tattoos there's no magic I just freehand them on and let's
8:30give it a world
8:36yeah
8:38now to make this look really jokes we're going to be using some Willie Stark

8:48actually draw this but thank God on the shadows crack
8:50i'm gonna be using a little mac 252 brush and we are really got a highlight
8:56under them around so we're just going to drag this out and just merge that in and
9:03look at that this is like a little full full drag proud today
9:08next step is really easy we're just going to take a little blending brush
9:12and another blending brush and we're just going to jump into the lonely
9:16violet vice palette now this has really great neutrals i love the look that
9:23we're going to recreate i basically had like a transition color coming all the
9:28way in here cutting out my crease and I left that blank and a really bright neon
9:33liner so we're just going to take a Toby color and we're going to take it all the
9:37way and cut out that lid and then we're going to leave this all blank for that
9:41neon liner to have its a moment so i'm going to be dipping into a ragamuffin
9:45right here and
9:46and we're just going to talk this right in here
9:54take this color little more and then we're just gonna talk it and put a
9:57little bit on that lid just what kind of all flows together so i am going to
10:01blend this out of course we are not leaving it like that but i'm just going
10:04to sketch it out on the other side as well and then we'll get your buffing and
10:07blending and now we're going to take this lighter shade called mama bird
10:11we're just going to dip into that and then we are going to blend out
10:16then make this look really airbrushed
10:22and then I'm going to get back into that white eyeshadow with the first brush and
10:27I'm just gonna talk that white right in there so it really cuts that out
10:31like I come back and we're just going to leave that blank and then the same thing
10:35for the top we're just going to go over and make sure it looks really blended
10:40all right now let's get to the neon liner last time i use this hot yellow
10:45which looks so stunning
10:46this one is called dance party and I think it's sold out like immediately
10:50you guys were like hi I knew that Joe is the hot green what some call this one is
10:54called fanny pack
10:55hi really cute so these are water activated now
10:59last time i use this really really tiny brush this is the 202 liner brush from
11:04Smith cosmetics love this guy
11:06and this is water activated i'm just going to take a tiny little bit of water
11:11from this a high
11:13no one's tried is planted before you got the wrong one I feel like a super bowl
11:16commercial but this is just my favorite water
11:18I'm just going for a little bit in this camp
11:22now we're going to take that liner and we're just going to move it around
11:26huh oh so pretty i want to scream so I poured out some of the water
11:32now i'm just going to kind of move it around and then it gets really pigment
11:35did
11:36so you're just gonna want to take the liner brush and oh my god
11:42all right now I'm going to bring this up a little bit and just kind of put it
11:46over our shadow
11:48all right the liner is done and he's also come in a lot of other shades so I
11:52can't wait to get more and it was like a hot blue
11:55there's like a pink and we also have like black silver and other cool colors
11:58so definitely be getting a million of these is going to like my new stable
12:02color I'm like oh what is next mascara and you're probably like what is that it
12:08that's all I did the other day now you can take something in the water line if
12:11you want to add a little pop for mascara today I'm gonna be taking the iconic
12:14mascara from Gucci this is my new favorite i love the brush on this guy is
12:19so easy to work with and we're just going to coat our entire bottoms and top
12:30all right now for lips today I'm going to prep them with some lip scrub this is
12:34my own of a lower lip scrub in flavor spearmint and I like to just take some
12:38of my fingers and just go to town
12:42alright lips are smooth and already
12:46now today i'm going to be using my own the lower liquid lipsticks in shade or
12:50water melon soda and we're going to dab a little bit of a nude beach in the
12:53center for some extra dimension
12:58of course I'm going to leave a little bit in the center for a nude beach
13:01so I'm not going to fill it in all the way
13:04and now we're going to take a little bit of a nude beach and we're just going to
13:10press it right here and then we're going to take a little more key eyeshadow
13:15brush and we're just going to blend this in I love how this looks now of course
13:23if you want you can do a . in the center on your top left
13:27I kind of like to just leave it on the bottom so it gives my lips that extra
13:30like alright guys so this look is pretty much done you really don't need anything
13:35else of course if you want to add on more highlight because you have a really
13:38bad crazy obsession with highlighters
13:42you can always dip in and you know do a little bump it's been you know probably
13:45like 20 minutes since we put on you know the highlighter so of course if you want
13:49to read you more
13:51of course you can but besides that I think we're gonna need a little bit of
13:54setting spray
13:55ok so it since it is summer we're going to bring out our touch at dewy skin
13:59missed and we're just gonna shake and Shake and I wish nathan is here to help
14:04me with three more setting sprays but let's get our engines ready and let's
14:08get to spraying all right
14:13this look is complete alright guys this look is done it is probably one of my
14:20quickest looks I think taking away
14:22false lashes and tons of eyeshadow obviously saves you a lot of time so of
14:27course if you want to tailor this look do some black wings some silver some
14:31gold and yellow any color will work i think it's summer it's fun
14:35I mean I don't even care if it's Christmastime I just want to wear bright
14:38colors all the time and for lips could really swap this out with anything if
14:42you're afraid of bright colors just us straight up nude and you're still going
14:46to select or just do some light gloss and call it a day
14:49now one last tidbit i will have four new skin frost high lighter shades coming up
14:54in august so saddle up and i will see you guys on the next video bye guys
0:03hey everyone welcome back to my channel

0:22I feel like sometimes I get stuck in a rut and I do my same makeup over and
0:25over so I'm definitely experimenting and trying new things and going back to my
0:31old habits

4:31oh hello pigment yeah morphy ok
4:35the pigmentation and quality on this palette is sick
4:38a name now if you're going to share down your contour you can always check your
4:42powder brush and go over a hair
4:44I'm just going to go along the sides of my things real quick car about that chin

4:53morphy gave me this new nose contour brush to try the other day this is that
4:58be 47 when I saw it I was all
5:01mmm but they go it's hard for the nose a lens amazing so let's try and now
5:07knowing how pigmented these are
5:09I am totally going to be sparse and just dipped into a once okay and let's see
5:15what happens is bringing into my eyebrow bone structure
5:19i'm also going to bring the shadow down so it caps off mine own
5:24now i'm going to take the Beauty Blender again and just lightly about this
5:33all right now i'm going to do my signature Toby Brown eyebrows off camera
5:37if you want to see how i draw them on go through my channel and find my previous
5:41face routine video and I'll be right back
5:44all right let's get started on the eyes now i'm going to be using a light shadow
5:49from brow all the way to live as I normally do today i'm going to be using
5:53the tartlet palette and i love this shade right here called Super Mom
6:01so let's dip into that one and i'm going to be using my trusty Mac 252 brush as
6:06always
6:07now I love to pack this in so don't just swipe it around your eyes like really
6:11pack in that color
6:13now since i'm going to be doing my whole entire lid covered in rainbow glitter
6:22I definitely need a transition color so i'm going to be using the melt cosmetics
6:28Dark Matter stack and this first color I die it's called blur and i'm just going
6:35to be placing that in my crews and i'm gonna be using a mac
6:39- - for blending brush and we're just going to dip into this one and I'm just
6:45going to kind of create or around my I just really get into that crease
6:50now I don't want it too dark so I'm just going to lightly blend avoiding my lid
6:55area and i'm going to bring that down just wear my contour ended before and it
7:02was dragging it out past my
7:04i know i do you want to add a little bit more depth into that crease so i'm going
7:10to be taking the color right below it which is called unseen and i'm just
7:16going to do a little bit more more towards the middle so I have more of a
7:21depth and you know more definition come through transition color
7:26okay i'm going to put it a little bit on my lid right by the lash line but just
7:31on the outer corner
7:33all right now before I coat my entire lid with glitter I do need to color to
7:38put down before that and i'm going to be using this purple metal crush eyeshadow
7:44from kat von d this color is called danzig and it's so pretty
7:48I'm going to dip my morphe 433 eyeshadow brush in this completely I want it to be
7:55coded as does not have to be perfect this is just more so
7:59so the glitter has something to be on top of now what I really like about
8:05these eyeshadows is if you wet them which i'm going to take this mac fix+
8:09the shadows go on really crazy metallic and I was going to tuck that in my lid
8:18now i'm noticing that there's some fallout so to save myself from screaming
8:23later let's apply some Chanel loose powder under my eyes to catch that ball
8:29out which we will brush out later
8:32this part is not have to be perfect now if you've never baked before
8:37just type in baking makeup and you'll find a million things
8:42all right we're going to buff that out in a minute after i'm done with my eyes
8:45and will make all this bull and seamlessly
8:47all right now let's go back with the dance big purple eyeshadow and lets
8:51blend
8:53it out now i'm going to take this all the way in to my socket and drag it down
8:58just a tiny their bold on a look at that shine
9:03now that the purple is laid down i'm going to be taking another mac - 24 and
9:08I'm going to dip into that purple really lightly
9:11knock off the fall out and i'm going to go in and just start blending the purple
9:16up a little bit still looks a little softer and not so harsh
9:20nothing crazy just soft blend and you want to keep it harsh in here so I'm not
9:26gonna buff that out too much
9:28all right now I'm going to take the mac 135 brush and I'm just going to dust off
9:31that fallout with powder
9:34I found this old graftobian makeup liquids park alert now this literally is
9:40like liquid glitter
9:42it doesn't show up opaque enough for me but it's definitely a good base and i'm
9:47just going to take this and paint it
9:49oh hi sparkles over my lid now before it dries i'm going to take a sigma e 5 7
9:56flat brush and I'm just going to take some of this glitter and press it onto
10:02the brush
10:03I'm just going to press some on the lid oh wow
10:07hi I look like a party favor and i'm just going to type this in mice thought
10:11game
10:12it looks like a unicorn just threw up on my I ok because I'm glitter obsessed I'm
10:17going to bring it down a little bit on that purple
10:20there we go all right now I want my eyes to look extra dramatic today i'm going
10:25to be using the mac fascinating white eye pencil and i'm going to just put
10:30this on my waterline before i do any more litter shadows because I want my
10:34eyes - oh alright i really want more glitter on my eyes and I'm going to be
10:39layering a pigment down below I found this color pop eyeshadow it's called a
10:45visa it's like turquoise glitter would be going in with this Tom Ford 14
10:49eyeshadow brush and I'm just gonna chip in there
10:53lightly put it under that white color and right on that purple so they merge
11:00together
11:01see them kissing and making out right there and I was checking a Beauty
11:04Blender and I'm kind of softening the edges a little more
11:09all right now for the center of my lid I'm going to really coat it with glitter
11:14I'm gonna go back in with that graftobian glitter glam
11:18yeah
11:18and i'm going to leave some of the turquoise showing so we can have a
11:21little moment but i'm going to cover most of it
11:24I'm going to go in with this mac 3d glitter in lavender and go back with the
11:29same sigma brush
11:31now this is like a more refined version of that pic glitter we just used and I'm
11:36just gonna rest it on
11:38oh wow and then I'm going to slowly start dragging it a little down
11:45now you guys know I love to cry glitter that is my favorite thing to do

0:49matte palette this is the 01 basic so great so I'm just going to take this
0:54really light color is the lightest one of the palette and i am going to pack
1:01that under my brow
1:03now when we get closer to the lid i'm going to be using the second lightest
1:07nude shade and then bringing it all the way down to basically my lash line
1:14so a lot of people like to use primers this is basically my primer and we're
1:19going to bring it all the way to tell the brow and a little past

1:40I'm going to pack this on my eyes so with this Mac - 10 rush i'm going to
1:45pack on a lot of pigment and i'm just going to take this color and i'm going
1:50to start blending it in the corners of my eye and I'm going to bring it down
1:58like thirty percent for my eye so not in the middle but thirty percent you know
2:08i'm going to take this same color and bring it to the top case with any
2:13fallout it's going to lightly brushed away
2:16we have what i like to call the base of the look down
2:20now i'm just going to jump right into it and take this bright blue eyeshadow
2:24called after party from sugarpill i'm going to be blending out the blue with a
2:30really light blue from honest hacia called I see now for this look I'm going
2:35to be using a lot of different eye brushes
2:37we got a lot going on here so i will be starting with the morphe 441 brush and
2:42I'm going to be packing it on with this chanel rush number 19 and then i'm going
2:47to be blending it out a little bit with this Gucci brush the blending number 20
2:53see what happens
3:02all right now i'm going to be taking a map 224 brush and I'm going to be
3:12blending the sugar pill blue with the honest top see i see both on my brush
3:18so I getting nice soft then now you may notice that I blow a lot of the brushes
3:25if I was doing someone elses makeup blowing is prohibited unless they're
3:29paying you extra
3:30but for real i would only blow on my brushes because they are mine and i can
3:35and it is to avoid a lot of fallout because i have all of this pretty
3:39foundation on
3:40so if you see me going that's exactly what i'm doing i am blowing cool
3:45now i'm going to take I see shadow by itself and just kind of these edges
4:04now i'm going to take this on the stops to get shadow in Star cobalt and I'm
4:10going to pack it on a little bit on my lid with some definition and we're just
4:23packing
4:27all right now we're going to go back to our blending brush take a little bit
4:33more of that light light blue bristles and we're just going to go over the dark
4:38- they all come together like besties
4:42there we go now before i do the under I'm a little bit more of that
4:47thunderstruck I shout out on top
4:51so we get a nice glow we blend lose
4:56now we're going to move under the eyes now i'm just taking that same more a
5:01blender and I didn't dip into the eye shadow again this is left over so there
5:07is minimal fallout and I'm just gonna start blending the blue into this white
5:14gold shadow
5:16I try to do is minimal of the cane and so there is not a lot of shadow falling
5:20all over you
5:25now before I do anything else
5:29i'm going to add some white liner into my waterline whenever I do
5:33bright colors I love to add white because it really makes it pop
5:37you looked very artificial if we will and very dull like this is max quite
5:41fascinating liner
5:43I'm just going to pull my skin down ever so gently and I'm going to pack this in
5:49now I love white liner i've been using it since the nineties
5:54it is just my go-to it opened the I writings very different
6:00it's a cool effect when you see me go back and forth a lot
6:04not because the product isn't good but i like to really pack it in there so it is
6:09on all day
6:11now to finish off the eyes i'm going to do some really dramatic lashes from one
6:16of my favorite brands letter
6:18this style is called intoxicating and they are big
6:22I love these lashes really transform your entire look I think now I'm going
6:27to coat my bottom and top lashes with mascara and my favorite is the better
6:31than sex
6:32by Too Faced i love the bristles they are perfect for my eyes now
6:38this application is not be perfect since we are going to cover them
6:42I just don't like when people put on lashes without any mascara and you can
6:46see there real human hair showing through or it's just not the same color
6:51our lashes will never be this black
6:54hence why there is mascara so let's coat views thoroughly
7:02all right now and I do lashes i like to take the strip off and of course i like
7:09to measure them to my eyes
7:10so not everyone has crazy big lids fit these lashes so I've already pre-trimmed
7:15mine a little bit with a little bit of nail scissors
7:17now since latex smells like a dirty vagina i like to use non latex glue from
7:24you up so this is the B conversion so we're going to make that tacky for a
7:27second
7:28now sometimes i like to start in the middle and let go
7:32so I cannot going to get up close and personal for a second these are Wow see
7:36the difference of an eyelash
7:38all right lashes are done right before highlight i'm going to do a little fix+
7:43refreshing make sure my foundation is there now I've been developing my own
7:50highlighters they are coming out spring of 2016
7:54so i have a new one now the pan is going to be a lot bigger than this but this is
7:59one of the shade it is called deep freeze and it is a baby blue my
8:03highlighters are very pigmented so it
8:06remember to not pack it on too crazy if it is a wild color so I'm just going to
8:11lightly dust in the pan and I'm going to be working it into the skin
8:18no how come no one's done a blue highlighter for I don't like a no but it
8:23was about time making some options here people i'm getting bored
8:27all right now I'm going to take a little bit of highlighter my mac 252 and I'm
8:33just gonna lightly little bit
8:37lightly meaning intense in my world now I'm going to add a little bit of
8:41highlighter right on my Cupid's bow and bring it down on my lip tiny bit
8:48so when I put on my lipstick that ruined now I love to cry glitter so i'm going
8:55to use lit cosmetics in Tinseltown for that fact
9:00now you don't need any and keep any glitter and hear anything I just use my
9:03trip

3:27just gonna blend and buff it out a little bit not being really soft with my
3:31pressure so it just looks effortless and then i'm going to start to drag it down
3:36a little this way and then I'm gonna take some darkness and learn that up on
3:40the nostrils come on nostrils

4:46out by mm that's all you need you guys because this is dead
4:49Lee now i'm just going to take us on the high plains of my cheekbones and I'm not
4:53going to bring it down as low as i normally do because i want to look
4:58really high and elevated like a lavender glasses on my cheeks
5:02all right now it's time for the Cupid's bow so let's just dust on there
5:06I like to look like I was drinking a glass of silver surfers come

5:13going to my lipstick for a minute was gonna just someone here because my
5:16bottom lip is like now
5:19the nose was really important so I'm just going to take one little finger
5:23swipe that's all you need
5:24and it was gonna rub it on the end
5:27and we're just gonna dust that and
5:29and go so it's like really really really extreme now
5:34sometimes I'll go back in with that you know it's contour just kind of clean up
5:38a little bit nach gods
5:40now let's go on to these eyes for the highlight under the brow all the way to
5:44the lid color
5:45we're gonna be dipping into my particular palette now this sold out so
5:49quickly when it launched a few weeks ago I was like jesus take the wheel
5:54so now my site is officially restock so if you want to dip into this madness all
5:58summer long
5:59give it a try i'm gonna be using this amazing like bone ivory color this is
6:03called China white and i'm just using a little flat synthetic brush
6:07let's go to blending now if you get that really dark smoky eye is actually way
6:15easier than you think i'm just going to be using this mac paint pot this is from
6:19the pro collection it's called black ground
6:22it is really dope so basically just going to coat my entire lives with this
6:25and then you shadow to buff and blend and make it really smoky so it's really
6:30not hard and its really don't fall out with this which is amazing
6:33so I'm gonna be using this ocean l blender synthetic brush and we're just
6:36going to dip right in
6:37hi it works quickly now it depends on where you want it i like to have mine
6:42all the way and
6:43then we'll put some highlight on the outside so i'm just going to start by
6:46coating my entire lid
6:49now this has so much pigment and this brush is just going to help me get it
6:53blend it out a little bit so i am going to stop it right here and then I'm gonna
6:58drag it down and i'll probably keep it just like that and then you gotta drag
7:04it in
7:05and of course we'll use a lot more big man let me dip into my pot and that's it
7:11you're just going to coat all the way over now of course if you don't like it
7:15all the way in the inner corner you can scale it back this is just what I prefer
7:19and then I'd like to drag it out this way
7:23and that's it now this part does not look pretty so you're like a hook in
7:26morning panda
7:27this is obviously just the base so you know it's going to look a little ugly
7:31before it gets pretty kind of my birth the black is a late and now lets blend
7:36it out i'm going to take a little mac 217 brush and I'm going to dip into some
7:40grey eyeshadow

8:38sometimes I like to mix to get a more customized color and I'm just gonna coat
8:43my entire brush so we're gonna tough this out and just really go lightly over
8:49that harsh line and start dragging up a little bit just so it starts to get that
8:54amazing
8:55blendy look and it's just a lot of really small back and forth motions and
9:01then what we're going to do is when we start to drag it up

1:04send me the pictures girl like I want to see what you guys be doing go outside
1:07your comfort zone do something they'll enjoy watching this
1:10what I'm gonna start this look by using my busy art basic matte eyeshadow
1:15palette and I'm going to be picking the lightest shade and i'm just going to be
1:19placing that right under my brow and bring it all the way down to the lash
1:24line
1:25now i've been using this mac 252 brush for like 10 years
1:30so I just stick to this one and love it really easy to blend
1:38now i'm going to do a black winged liner today but before I do that I'm going to
1:44add some soft camel eyeshadow below just to give it that really dramatic look
1:51i'm gonna be using this bobby brown eyeshadow and the shape is called camel
1:55this is the morphe 514
1:58i have about 16 of these on my makeup station
2:01my eyes are deep set I'm gonna be taking the shadow and almost bringing it down
2:05to where the contour my nose is and over my lid and slightly out so it will match
2:12the black winged liner and about to do and just going to drag it out for the
2:22brow and and we would do that later
2:26all right now that the other side matches perfectly
2:29I'm going to go in with him actually for blending brush and I'm going to take the
2:33same
2:34Bobby around I shout out and just start popping it up and outwards
2:40now i'm gonna be really delicate so this looks really soft
2:44all right now to soften those edges on the top i'm gonna go back in with that
2:49light shade and just start blending and blending just so they look really nice
2:56and smooth and not too harsh
2:58I'm going to take some shadow and put it more method can carve out that Brown
3:05all right look at our wing all right now for the black-winged i'm gonna be using
3:10the Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper and i'm going to be using that chart
3:14black clay liner
3:16I love the stuff that you do not come off so i'm going to do the base with
3:20this and then fill in with the chart
3:24now when I do like to hold my breath so the line is precise
3:28so let's have a moment of silence for the liner
3:34yeah
3:42now that I got my shape down i'm going to be using this mac 263 brush to
3:48filling threat to my liner
3:50now if you want to your whole I with the letter you can i love you use gel liners
3:55because it really make sure the wing is not robot for him off later
3:59who knows we're going to be doing if you're at the mall at the grocery store
4:01doing papi
4:03you definitely do not want your wing to come up okay all right now that our
4:11liner is on fleet and can cut a bitch we are going to add some glitter on top of
4:15the liner
4:16now my favorite liquor brand which i have used before is lit cosmetics
4:20I love these you guys this shade is called soul sister it is like a
4:25chameleon is crawling on my liner
4:28it's like green yellow it looks like an oil slick when you put it over black so
4:33I'm gonna be using the lit liquid glitter base and I'm just gonna dunk it
4:38in here and i'm going to paint it over
4:42hot now let's add some glitter
4:46oh hello liner and all i'm doing is adding it on very carefully
4:50all right
4:53both sides are done let me just sweep away some fallout and we are good to go
4:59for two latches i'm going to really smoke out my under eye with a metallic
5:03green and i'm going to add in some liner so as always i'm gonna go back to my Mac
5:07smoldering eye pencil and i'm going to put that in the water line and then
5:10we're gonna smoke it out with some crazy greens and as always you guys
5:14this does not have to be perfect because we are going to use it to smudge how i
5:18am going to take the black all the way and connected with the wing
5:22cool it to smoking all right so I'm gonna be using this kat von d metal
5:26crash eyeshadow in shape ke if you guys have never tried this before
5:30you're missing out because the pigment on these is out of this world now you
5:34can use this wet or dry i mean is it dry first to smoke out and then we can see
5:39what's gonna happen girl crushes the trial so faded at this is the 210 and
5:44i'm going to start smudging it over the black liner and just bringing it down
5:49really like pc have a follow-up we're going to go back and just brush off
5:58quickly
6:00all right now I'm going to go in with a another morphy 514 brush and we're gonna
6:04dip it into the same green eye shadow and we're just going to go over what we
6:09just did and make it even more smoky and dramatic this green is everything well
6:15now I like to do a little more black
6:19so I'm gonna take a black eye shadow and smudge it out a little bit more
6:24no I just a black I lied to be a dark gray color and I'm gonna use the same
6:29brush that had the green on it and we're just going to lightly get in there and
6:33i'm just going to take that fullness in the lash line and just starts smoking it
6:38out
6:39bloom or it may seem subtle to you guys but it actually makes a big different
6:45now before i do my lashes i'm going to use some mascara
6:49now i'm gonna try this benefit roller lash today's packaging so cute
6:53so let's see how it is now this one is very different for me you guys know I
6:56like a really big dick that one
6:59wait a minute and never used this before

7:17but with the dominoes shout out to you mr. brizel the lashes today i'm going to
7:26be using flutter lashes in style
7:28Leila these are big and dramatic
7:32so clearly i need to be using them as always i'm going to use my two of you
7:36can lash glue these lashes are very dramatic so I'm just going to try to get
7:41them to close to my lash line as possible so that glitter is not it
7:45and I like to take my real lashes and the false one and kind of mesh them to
7:50get their latches are done
7:52let's get to highlighting for highlighting today i'm going to be using
7:59two products the first one is this mac mineralize skinfinish the shade is
8:04called perfect topping i love this one

7:45copper smoky drama i'm going to be using my Urban Decay eye primer and I'm just
7:50gonna do low one to swipe

7:56auburn color matches the pink and I might be blonder than this video but for
8:01now I love
8:02I'm just loving the brows I was taking a little flat synthetic brush and we are
8:06going to blend that primer into the lids now to start
8:12I'm going to be dipping into my own brands palette this is the beauty killer
8:16eyeshadow palette and I'm going to be using you two shades today
8:19first one I'm going to be using is China white and I'm going to take the same
8:22brush and I was gonna do my brow bone
8:26and highlight that now this is a very natural light ivory color so I'm just
8:32going to press that into the skin and then dragged down
8:38this is going to help my shadows blend later and just gives a pretty little
8:42highlight now we're going to take a little mac 224 brush and we're going to
8:47dip into a little transition shade called Kourtney and we're just going to
8:51put that right in our crease
8:55all right now notice how i am just kind of dragging this out a little bit right
9:02here just to give that I little illusion so now that this is done being blended
9:07we are going to add a little darkness in here with some copper shades
9:12now before I do anything else I'm going to go back into Kourtney and just do a
9:16little on my lids and
9:19there we go now to create that really dark copper moment i'm going to be using
9:22on stocks at beverly hills CNN
9:25oh come on first of all the pigments amazing so I'm really gonna darken my
9:29lid and start to blend that color out now everyone wanted to know what I was
9:35wearing on my lids the other day for that really wet metallic look so before
9:39we dive into that i am going to leave a space right in here to put that where I
9:43really don't need to put eyeshadow and then for a little touch of little more
9:48copper - I mean we need more warped to this space we're going to be using
9:51Anasazi as a blazing eyeshadow as well it's a little more rather than sienna
9:56and I'm just gonna put that in here as well
10:00we're just mixing matching today people
10:07now that this is blended into perfection of using the steel and magnificent
10:11metals now this is what gets that wet effect on your lids and this is shade
10:16king
10:16now it comes with these little dropper things you could mix to make it like a
10:20really crazy
10:20I'm going to be really country and to show you what I do yes I just like my
10:25own brush because i am putting it on myself
10:27do not ever like a brush and then put on our clients eyes but if you're doing on
10:30yourself
10:31who the fuck cares so I'm just going to take a little bit of this on the bridge
10:34soul you see how what'd that looks using this dry
10:36it's all right wedding a tiny bit I mean do you fucking say that
10:40whoa this is the definition of bullying bullying
10:44so the product is a little tacky you do have to move it around with the brush
10:49and then I'm just going to drag it down and fill in that blank space that we
10:54talked about earlier that we did not need any shadow for and then we're going
10:57to take a little bit more and here as well start to kind of get it out
11:00and there you have it come on now
11:05now they have these in like like 30 shades just like looking at on my lid i
11:09want to scream

11:21and i'm going to use this brown one this is called deep espresso
11:25this is like a brown black like this cute little packaging
11:28I love it's like now this is one of the felt tips and you do need to shake it
11:33for a second there are 1 million colors which I thought was amazing know what is
11:37this a inspired by Japanese calligraphy pens flexible felt tip allows you to
11:42create a paintbrush like stroke for clean mines
11:46all right well I'm just gonna dive right in here and just drag it on the lash
11:51line so our lashes look very pretty later
11:54I'm going to do the tiniest little wing and shock you all
11:57all right now to smoke out that bottom lash line and get that really deep
12:03copper fact i'm going to start out with my Mac some older I pencil and we're
12:09just going to quickly do the entire water line now we're going to smoke out
12:16that bottom lash line and he's on it stops at beverly hills shadow in henna
12:21now this one is like a deep copper and it has a lot of bling to it
12:24so I'm gonna actually use the liner to help me deep in and kind of create a
12:31more smoky look and I was going to start here with the pencil brush and just
12:35lightly really lightly almost like we're doing surgery go under the black liner
12:41now to avoid any fallout
12:44you're just going to be really gentle and go all the way across
12:49now I like to take the brush and kind of drag some of that black liner down and
12:54just kind of mix it in

0:05hey guys so today's video is another Valentine's Day tutorial I said that I
0:20would be posting like two more this is the second look I came up with and i'm
0:25using the very obvious naked 3 palette i know there's tons of Valentine's Day
0:30tutorials with this palette but a bunch of you requested that I do a Valentine's
0:33they look with the palette so that's what I did and this is what i came up
0:38with I only used one other eye shadow that wasn't in this palette but it's a
0:43purple and you can find her body we're actually really like this look because
0:48it is really really simple it's a nice light pink blush like pink lips and like
0:53a pinky purple
0:54I and I just think it's nice and sweet and soft and romantic
1:00so for those of you who like that soft and romantic look this one is perfect
1:05for you
1:05so let me know down below if you like this to run if you want to see how to
1:08get this look then just keep on you
1:11I'm going to start by priming my eyelids with Too Faced shadow insurance then I'm
1:18going to take the color limit and the naked 3 palette and this is going to be
1:20my transition color and taking it on a fluffy brush and I'm just probably going
1:25to put this all over my crease some of my eye as well
1:31then I'm taking the color buzz in the palette and i am going to apply this all
1:36over my lid with a flat shader brush the pigmentation on this eyeshadow isn't the
1:44best as you can probably tell so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a
1:48little bit of a fix plus and spray that on my brush and then give it back into
1:52the eyeshadow and apply it like that
2:00yeah
2:01then I'm going to take nooner and on my - 17 I'm just gonna quickly blend the
2:07harsh edge of that eye shadow
2:13now i'm going to take my wet and wild last palette this is the other i'm sure
2:20i'm using for this tutorial but you can use any matte purple
2:24this is a duper max fake one if you have the eyeshadow then use that one but I'm
2:29just going to take my mac 217 and i'm going to start applying this eyeshadow
2:33on the outer view of my eye and then drag it up into the crease
2:41yeah
2:47now i'm going to take limit which is the first shadow we used and do the exact
2:52same thing i'm going to just blend this into my crease so that everything blends
2:57nicely
3:01and really quickly i'm just going to tight line and line my waterline with
3:04the Maybelline master drama eyeliner I'm going to take this bottle angled brush
3:10from hell and i'm going to dip it into max carbon and i'm going to start
3:13creating a line and I didn't want to use gel or liquid liner because I didn't
3:18want it to be too harsh I wanted to be really really soft
3:26next I'm taking black heart from the palette and I'm going to start stamping
3:31this on the outer V of my eye and then dragging it in so it fades nicely
3:37I just want to add a little bit of definition to the outer wheel my eye
3:45yeah
3:51yeah
3:55yeah
3:57yeah
3:59for my highlight am taking strange and i'm applying this underneath my problem
4:03and in my energy .
4:11I'm gonna go back into that buzz color with some more fix+ and apply it right
4:15in the center of my lid to give it that metallic pop
4:24then I'm just going to add some mascara and i'm going to move on to the rest of
4:28my face
4:29I already put my foundation and concealer on just to save some time but
4:32I'll listed down below what i used also i forgot to record it but I added some
4:38eye shadow to the lower lash line i added nooner from the palette
4:41I just smudge that underneath my lashes and then I added some mascara for my
4:46bronzer i am using the NYC bronzer in long talk bronze and I wanted my face to
4:51be very very simple
4:53which is why I didn't contour or anything like that
4:58I'm just rounding on my face a little bit for my blush i am using the l'oreal
5:05true match
5:06blush in baby blossom it's a light baby pink it's really pretty
5:10so I'm taking on my it cosmetics blush brush and I am just applying a very very
5:15subtle amount to my cheeks and then the sun went away but i am using my becca
5:22highlight in moonstone to highlight my cheekbones
5:30i am using the revlon pink pout super lustrous lipstick
5:39and then I am topping it off with the buxom lip gloss in White Russian
5:48yeah
5:57ok guys so that is the finished look I hope you like this tutorial thank you so
6:01much for watching and I'll see you in my next one
0:27hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right
0:33now it was a very very highly requested makeup tutorial and I was overwhelmed by
0:38how many of you guys wanted a tutorial on this look I was like managed to film
0:42the tutorial right before I film that video but i do this look all the time
0:46the only thing I don't do often is the blue underneath my eyes which actually
0:49really love I think it gives such a beautiful like twist to the look of the
0:53pop of blue underneath the eyes but i do bronzy warm colors like this all the
0:58time
0:59i am using the original naked palette which you guys know is my absolute
1:03favorite palette i do this look so so often and I never wanted to do a
1:08tutorial on it because I feel like there's so many tutorials that look just
1:11like this with the naked palette but it was so highly requested that I decided
1:15to go ahead and film it
1:17plus i think the pop of blue is just so beautiful i think this is such a
1:20beautiful night time summary look or you can wear it in the daytime because i am
1:24right now I don't care i'm just really obsessed with this look as well I think
1:28it's like a very like going to I don't know I think I heard them in a movie
1:36somewhere
1:37I don't know anyway so you have you want to see how to get this look then just
1:41keep on watching
1:44ok so i've already primed my eyes with Urban Decay primer potion
1:49but now i'm going in with the maybelline color tattoo in caramel cool and i'm
1:53going to apply this all over my lid and up to my crease as well
1:59the problem using is the urban decay naked palette and I'm going to take the
2:03color book which is the darker one out of the two matte shades and this is
2:07going to be my crease color
2:09so I'm just going back and forth into that book eyeshadow because I want my
2:12crease to be very pigmented I wanted to look like
2:15the color is going up pretty high past my crease so I'm just taking my time and
2:20blending this out
2:21adding more and more eye shadow little by little
2:35yeah
2:36next I'm going in with my favorite color in this palette and it is called smog
2:40and on a regular flat shader brush I'm going to apply this all over my lid up
2:45to my crease
2:55yeah
2:58I'm just gonna take the color right here is called half baked it's a beautiful
3:01beautiful gold color and i'm going to apply it right to the center of my lid
3:06it's going to give it like a really pretty pop of gold
3:15yeah
3:16I'm just taking smog again and i'm going to apply it to the very outside of my
3:21crease and the very inner part of my eye as well just know that the gold can
3:25really stand out
3:29now i'm just going to line my tight line i'm not going to line my waterline
3:34but just might I line with this Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
3:37midnight master and then I'm going to take the color virgin and this is gonna
3:40be my inner corner highlight and my brow bone highlight as well
3:45yeah
3:48now i'm just gonna go in with falsies i am using my ardell demi wispies and I am
3:52NOT adding gel eyeliner or liquid eyeliner so I want to make sure i get it
3:56as close to my lashes as possible here i'm just adding some more buck just
4:00keeping out the crease
4:04yeah
4:06moving on to my face i am going to prime with my L'Oreal miracle blur not so much
4:10prime but try to cover up some of my pores
4:14I'm just adding this to the places where I think I needed
4:22this stuff is just way too thick to put on my entire face but it does work well
4:26and in certain spots on my pain
4:32the foundation i'm going to be using is my revlon colorstay this is for normal
4:37to dry skin

7:46nice with this look
7:53I'm going to take my Maybelline master highlight highlighting blush and nude

0:19hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on juno gambler
0:26wow this is using at the urban decay naked smoky palette or Medicaid was nice

0:42so it should be already available to purchase on urban decay . com I know
0:46that on an altar . comic comes out in a few days but you can buy at Urban Decay
0:51today
0:52this video is not sponsored by the way i'm just posting it on the day it's
0:56gonna be released really quick let me just give you like a mini review i love
1:00it i love the packaging
1:01I love the packaging still to this day my favorite packaging is the original
1:05naked palette I know that everybody hates that packaging but I love it and I
1:09despise the packaging on the Naked 2 m3 and then when this one came out I was so
1:14excited because it's like a magnet
1:16it's not like a 10 that closes so I'm so glad that they change the packaging and
1:20honestly when I saw this for the first time I was like wow this is exactly what
1:25i wanted the naked2 to be
1:27I love the first one it's my it's 14 pallets of all time and the third one is
1:31beautiful it's nice and rosy and then this one is what i wanted the second one
1:34to be like a smoky version I'm so happy they came out with this i think it's
1:38worth it even if you have the first one because it's different it's deeper it's
1:42more cool tone it's just start it smoky but this is the look i came up with I
1:46really love it for like a night out clubbing or something i really like it
1:51so if you want to get this local then just keep watching
1:55ok so the first thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids with Jessie's Girl
1:59eyeshadow primer I've been really liking this lately
2:02then I'm going to take the eyeshadow called combust
2:05this color is really close to my skin tone only a little bit more pinky
2:09so I'm just using this to set the eyeshadow primer because that primer is
2:12a little tacky
2:14I'm going into this white ish shade which i think is called 13 and i'm using
2:19this underneath my brow bone to really highlight and lift the brow and in my
2:24inner corners even though i'm going in with a different color later i'm going
2:28to take this
2:29milani milani milani shadow eyes and black and i'm using this as a base
2:35so I'm applying this to my entire lid and then I'm gonna kind of like you know
2:39move it around and try to blend it with just a regular eyeshadow brush
2:45I'm sick by the way my sound at that's why I'm gonna take this eyeshadow called
2:50armor
2:51I love this color because it has a ton of glitter but the glitter actually
2:56shows up like it's pigment enough to wear it it shows up I don't know it's
3:01really really really pretty
3:03i'm applying this to my entire lid i just love how it looks with a black base
3:07underneath that makes it deeper and I'm taking password
3:16i'm going to start blending this into my crease because we put a black bass down
3:20like a harsh line kind of created on my so I'm just going back and forth with
3:25the eyeshadow password taking my time and really trying to blend those two
3:30eyeshadows together it's going to take some time but you just have to double
3:33and 11
3:34I'm going right back into combust with a fluffy brush with no product with like
3:42no previous product just come bus and I'm blending everything taking the
3:47purple in the palace
3:48it's a good dark dark purple I think it's called remember but i'm just using
3:54this on the outer V of my eye it doesn't give too much step but just enough like
3:59I just want the outer corners to be just a little bit deeper and I'm dragging
4:03some of that into the crease just to help blend some more
4:06I decided this look would look really pretty with a wing a big wing a Smalling
4:11it doesn't really matter but i'm just adding a small little wing
4:14I want the eyeshadows to really stand out so I don't want to go too heavy with
4:17my wing
4:18now i'm just applying a ton of roller lash mascara to my bottom lashes and
4:23i'll finish the rest of my eyes when i'm done with my face
4:26ok so i decided to use this for the first time this is from lush cosmetics
4:29and it's called the skin tint feeling feeling younger skin tint gives your
4:35face like such luminosity
4:37it's very similar to the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer so yeah I put that on my
4:42face is like a nice moisturizing luminizing stuff then i went in with the
4:46LC foundation and I am in the shade sand
4:50I believe
4:51so yeah that's what I'm going on my face
4:55I actually really like this formation it is matt and it can be a little heavy but
4:59with a light layer
5:01it's actually really really pretty and it looks nice and Matt and really pretty
5:06I like it I dig it now i'm taking the urban decay naked skin concealer and the
5:11maybelline fit me concealer mixing both of them together just to get like a
5:16perfect color and then i will be blending that out as a huge
5:21i'm also highlighting with the fit me
5:28with my of course trustee to release - 17
5:32I feel like I talk about this all the time but i love it was sent to me by a
5:35subscriber not even by the companies and don't always has no idea who the heck I
5:39am but thank you so much because they freakin look
5:41now i'm going to set that with a the wave a brush and I'm dipping the brush
5:46into the Kat Von D shade and light palette and I'm using the yellow shade
5:50to set my concealer and I'm gonna finish off the eyes I'm using the next check
5:59Charlie I can say black gel eyeliner and then i'm going to go in with slate
6:06I've no password this is password and with a pencil brush
6:09I am rubbing that in my lower lash line to smoke out the black eyeliner and then
6:13I wanted it to be just a little darker
6:15so I'm taking that color right there and just further some no get out
6:22i'm applying some roller lash mascara to my bottom lashes and minimal problems
6:28and policies and the falls i use or the posh with lashes and i'm going to go
6:33into hi this is the first pallet
6:36I mean the first shadow on the palate and actually what the eyeshadow with a
6:39little bit fix+ so it can be super intense and that's what I applied to my
6:44inner corners now I'm just going to contour using the Kat Von D shade light
6:48palette i'm using the more cool tone color and an angled brush to add some
6:52content to my cheekbones like my voice is going away so like I'm going to go
6:58cold
6:59this sucks now i'm going to take the warmer shade in the palette because when
7:04I have a tan too much in
7:06I don't like my contour to be too ashy I'm just adding a little bit of warmth
7:11the blush I'm using is tarts captivating
7:28then for highlight I'm using this to analyse duo
7:34so don't lace what the heck the Sonia Kashuk duo that has like a bronze and
7:38highlights i'm using the pinky highlight from a highly it's super intense and
7:42super beautiful i highly recommend this you can get at target then I'm going to
7:46take the Loreal lalak lippy thingy and charcoal black and I'm applying this to
7:53my entire lips
7:55this is already glossy it's like a lacquer finish but i wanted to add some
7:59more gossip I'm taking the show for a perfect nude lip gloss and i'm applying
8:04that on top so that completes this look I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
8:09you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
8:12will see you in my next video bye
0:27hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial this is the look I was wearing
0:34in my only unboxing and a bunch of you guys said you wanted a tutorial on it i
0:38didn't use the cosmetics naturally pretty palette to achieve this look but
0:43honestly i only use two eyeshadows in the entire pallet this look is mainly
0:46focused around really thick eyeliner and really big voluminous fake lashes so
0:52basically anybody can achieve this look as long as you have eyeliner and fake
0:56lashes you're good to go as long as you use two colors that are similar to the
1:00ones that I used in this tutorial this tutorial was kind of an epic fail this
1:04eyeliner came out super wonky and it was just so frustrating and I wasn't going
1:10to take off all my makeup just put it back on so I mean it looks a little
1:15wonky forgive me but yeah I really want to get back into filming makeup
1:19tutorials more often used to do them all the time but i'm going to get back into
1:23filming a lot more for you guys so leave a comment down below if there's a
1:26palette i have that you want to tour on or anything like that and i will film
1:30those for you if you want to see how to get this really thick eyeliner thick
1:35lashes look what is this i don't know just keep watching
1:39so I'm going to do things a little bit different in this video I'm starting off
1:43with my face that usually start off with my eyes but I am taking the Baum's
1:47tinted moisturizer called bomb shelter and i'm going to be using my makeup geek
1:52foundation stippling brush to apply it
1:56this tinted moisturizer is a little bit weird when I first apply you don't
2:00really see much color coming off but as they both fit into my skin it oxidizes
2:04which is ok for me because it oxidizes immediately and it matches my neck and
2:10the rest of my body so good and I'm speeding through this clip because it
2:15would take way too long for you to sit there and see the whole process I put
2:18two layers on my face just to get more coverage and it sent invoice riser so it
2:22doesn't get kinky at all i love this tinted moisturizer love the finish it's
2:26my fav next I'm gonna take my booboo cover up concealer and I'm going to be
2:31applying this underneath my eyes in a triangle shape just to highlight and
2:36cover up my dark circles of course
2:45yeah
2:47yeah
2:54yeah
3:11i'm using this elf foundation brush just to blend everything else
3:17yeah
3:20now i'm taking my Too Faced shadow insurance and i'm going to prime my
3:24eyelids
3:29yeah
3:37and then because i have a lot of veins on my eyes I'm just gonna take that same
3:40boo cover up concealer and add this to my whole eyelid just so it's a nice even
3:45canvas and there are no veins poking through or anything like that
3:51yeah
3:55next I'm taking my mac emphasize powder and with my Real Techniques contour
4:00brush i'm just going to set the concealer
4:06and i'm also going to bring this onto my eyelids because this Potter has a really
4:09pretty rude essence to it
4:11I don't know how to explain it just looks really really nice and glowy so I
4:15like to bring it on my eyelids as well especially for this look I just think it
4:18looks nice now i'm taking my it cosmetics naturally pretty palette and
4:24I'm gonna take this shade right here called transforming pearl and i'm going
4:27to use this to highlight underneath my brow bone
4:34next I'm taking this shade called mocha and i'm going to take my mac 217 and
4:40start adding this to the outer V of my eye and then slowly bring it into the
4:44crease
4:48I just go back and forth with this eyeshadow adding a little by little
4:56yeah
5:00i'm also creating like a triangle with the same eyeshadow just flicking my
5:04brush outwards like that so it looks like a nice little sharp triangle shape
5:09on the outer beef if you know what I'm saying hey I just go back and forth with
5:14the eyeshadow and build it up a little by little
5:16now i'm going to take this transforming pearl shade again and I'm going to add
5:20some to the inner parts of my eye just to make it look nice and glowy and then
5:24this is gonna be my inner corner highlight as well now i'm going to line
5:28my tight line and my waterline with Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
5:32midnight master and then I'm going to be adding some falsies with this look these
5:38are from house of lashes and they're in the style called true romance and I
5:43cannot put on false lashes on camera to save my life it takes forever so i just
5:48did that off-camera and now i'm taking my Maybelline line stiletto liquid liner
5:53and i'm just adding a really really thick eyeliner on top i'm going to go
5:59back into that palette and take the shade mocha and i'm just going to deepen
6:03out my crease with this and my outer V just a little bit more
6:11and I'm gonna take that same eyeshadow and run it underneath my lashes just to
6:14smoke it out a little bit and then I'm going to add mascara moving on to the
6:18rest of my face i am taking my bahama mama bronzer by the bomb and i'm going
6:23to be using a sigma highlighting brush just to contour my face
6:31yeah
6:40yeah
6:42yeah
6:44yeah
6:55yeah
6:57and i'm taking my pixie bronzer and suddenly son touched i use this as a
7:01blush because it is a little bit pink and i'm going to add this to my cheeks
7:08and I'm gonna finish off this look with lipstick this is quite be realistic in
7:12the shade musk and i'm going to apply this to my lips
7:18and then I'm going to add my NYX butter gloss in fortune cookie right on top
7:22this is a very very pale nude but i like to add it to dr. lipsticks just to make
7:26them a little bit lighter and that is the finished look I hope you guys
7:31enjoyed thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't
7:34already and I will see you in my next video
0:17so i found a tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right now it is using the Urban
0:25Decay Naked 2 palette and I really wanted to film this kind of tutorial
0:29because i usually wear like browns and golds
0:34as opposed to blacks and sellers so I kind of wanted to branch out and do
0:38something different and I rarely use my naked 2 palette since it's a little bit
0:43more cool tone so I wanted to bring this puppy out and do something for the cool
0:48tone lovers out there and I'm actually really liking how it turned out I don't
0:53know I just I really really love it if you want to see how I got this look then
0:56just keep on watching
0:57ok so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to prime my eyelids with Mac's
1:04painterly Paint Pot
1:09for that really sharp cat eye look like they're really sharp edges
1:13I'm going to take some tape and put it on the back of my hand a few times just
1:17so that it doesn't pull at the skin around my eyes
1:26now i'm going in with Urban Decay's Naked 2 palette and I'm going to be
1:32taking the color tease
1:36and with the sigma e40 i am going to work that into my crease
1:41I'm just going to be using this as a transition color so all the other colors
1:45blend nicely
1:56next I'm going in with the color pistol which is this color right here and I'm
2:01taking it on a mac 239 brush and I'm going to pack this color on my entire
2:08lid
2:21ok
2:30ok so because i want this color to really stand out
2:34I'm going to take max fix+ and spray that on my brush and adding 6 plus to
2:41any eyeshadow really intensifies the color a lot so I'm just going to pack
2:46this on my lid again
2:59yeah
3:00so you can really see what a difference the fixed plus makes on the eye shadow
3:09yeah
3:12now i'm going in with the color black out and i'm just going to work this on
3:17the outer part of my eye and a little bit in the crease
3:21this part takes a lot of time it's just really going back and forth with that
3:25same color and just working it in lightly because blackout is a very very
3:30pigmented black eyeshadow
3:32so going back in forth and adding that shadow little by little kind of helps
3:36you blend it out a lot more as opposed to just dipping your brush into the eye
3:41shadow and putting it on your I are gonna have like a big black spot because
3:44it's so pigmented so just take your time with it and go back and forth and just
3:48work it into the crease and into the outer corners as well
4:20ok now I'm going to take this brush right here it's from coastal sense
4:23it's just an eyeshadow brush but it's really soft so I like using it for this
4:27and i'm just going to be dipping it back into that same blackout color and really
4:32packing on the color on the outer corners and blending it towards the
4:37center of my eye
4:38so this part is just really a lot a lot of blending you just want to take the
4:43color and mostly focusing on the outer part of your I like where the tape meets
4:48the eye shadow and just blend it towards the center
4:54like I said it's just a lot of blending just pack the color out on the outer
4:58corner and start blending it in
5:04this part is completely up to you if you want it really really intense black on
5:08the outer corners or if you don't want it so intense so whatever is comfortable
5:13for you
5:25yeah
5:27ok
5:33now i'm taking the color foxy and i'm adding this as my highlight under my
5:39brow bone
5:46this color fox is pretty much the color of my skin
5:50so I'm going to be taking a little bit of booty call it took very shimmery so
5:54I'm only taking a little bit of it and adding it to like the high . underneath
5:59my eyebrow like underneath the arch
6:05now i'm taking my favorite eyeliner it is the Maybelline master drama eyeliner
6:14and i'm going to tight line with this and also be adding this to my waterline
6:25ok now for the liquid liner i'm using my Maybelline mine stiletto and just adding
6:33some liquid liner
6:51ok I really want the liquid liner to be as mad as possible and the lines the
6:56little can kind of leave it a little bit glossy
6:58so I'm going to take black out and just kind of set the liquid liner with the
7:02black eyeshadow and it makes it look very matte which is what I want
7:09now i'm just taking off the tape and you have this perfectly straight sharp cat I
7:14kind of look I love it and I'm just taking my little makeup remover and kind
7:21of like cleaning around any fallout yada yada
7:24you know you know
7:32ok and here i'm just doing the face makeup
7:35I didn't really go into detail with this I i always do
7:39so I wanted to keep it short for this video but of course i will be listing
7:42all the things i used on my face on in the description box but i'm just using
7:48some foundation and concealer not stuff
7:51I just really wanted to my foundation on before I finished my eyes because i am
7:55not done with my makeup
7:57if you're wondering see back to the ice ok i added two more eyeliner by the way
8:02because i felt like it had kind of faded
8:04ok so anyway I'm taking the brush that came with the naked 2 palette and I'm
8:09taking the color verb which is a very light shimmery silver and I'm going to
8:14pack this on the inner part of my eye so I want my I to go from like a light
8:19silver to a dark silver to black so I am packing on the inner part of my eye and
8:24I'm also putting this in my to deck area as my highlight
8:44yeah
8:50ok so now i'm taking a pencil brush and I'm doing it in to that same verb color
8:55and I'm going to put this all over my lower lash line
8:59I personally think it looks nice and kind of brightens up the lower lash line
9:03even though i have like really intense black eyeliner
9:06I don't know I just think you kind of brightens up the look a little bit and i
9:10personally think it looks nice
9:14but I mean if you want to go darker on the lower lash line you totally can and
9:18it would still look really really nice
9:20it is up to you
9:23so now i'm just going to take my clinic clash doubling mascara and add mascara
9:27to my top and bottom lashes
9:32and voila
9:37these are the finished eyes
9:43ok so i already did the rest of my face makeup just ate some time I don't want
9:48this video to be too long but I contoured with my ELF contouring blush
9:56and bronzing powder thing just concert with the bronzer and for my blush i use
10:03the NYX blush and mom
10:06i have been loving this you guys know that if you saw my favorites video it's
10:09just like my favorite blush with the moment and I highlighted with an
10:15eyeshadow in my ceiling in the light palette i highlighted with kin
10:21just like that highlight I have going on here i have been loving to highlight my
10:26cheeks with this kid eyeshadow it's beautiful
10:30yeah hello anyway I still need to put on some lipstick
10:34I'm first going to take people glam gaga from Mac - all busted and gross
10:41so I'm going to take it on well the first like this
10:49I'm putting it on very very lightly I don't want it to be like bubblegum pink
10:52just like a light wash of a baby pink color
11:01and then on top of that i am taking my NYX butter gloss and creme brulee
11:05I have been obsessed with this it's beautiful so that's what I'm going to
11:09layer on top
11:17ok guys so that is the finished look I really hope you like this tutorial and I
11:22hope you try it out on yourself
11:23thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already
11:27and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys todays video is a one brand tutorial on this look right here
0:07my last one brand tutorial was a full face elf makeup look
0:12and I got pretty positive feedback so i want to do these more often so today i
0:16am using all make up for ever
0:18products my next one brand tutorial will be drug store so I want to do like one
0:23drug store one high end and then alternate them back and forth so today
0:27at high-end since my last one was drug store and if you want to see how to get
0:30this look then just keep on watching
0:33I'm going to start by priming my face with the step 1 equalizer this is the
0:37hydrating one this one is probably my favorite one just because i do have dry
0:41skin and i love how it fits underneath my makeup then I'm going to take my holy
0:46grail foundation
0:47not just because it's Make Up For Ever it's literally my favorite foundation
0:51you guys know this if you saw my foundation video
0:54this is the face and body foundation it's waterproof at last such a long time
0:59it's a very sheer coverage but I find that it does even out my skin tone and
1:03because the coverage is kind of sheer i do have to build it up and work with it
1:06so that's why I'm fast-forwarding this part because if not we will be here for
1:10a good two minutes but i'm just applying that with a flat top student at least
1:14brush and now i'm making this face because when I wanted to film this video
1:19I realized it didn't have a concealer by make up for ever's I ran to the store
1:24and i purchased one on sephora this is the waterproof full-coverage concealer i
1:29have mine in the shade number four
1:31honestly this stuff is amazing but I think it would be better for blemishes
1:36because for underneath the eyes even though it has great coverage
1:39it's a little tacky and it's a little thick so it does crease
1:43I mean it worked perfectly fine for me and it lasted for the rest of the day
1:47but you do have to set it immediately because if not it will create because of
1:52the
1:52Agnes but hey I can't complain i'm like it
1:55so because i don't have a make up for ever setting powder
1:58I am just get a little creative here and i am using a artists eye shadow in the
2:03shape and 500 which is like a vanilla creamy matte shade so it's set my
2:08concealer perfectly
2:15by the way i also put that concealer on my eyelid to act as a primer so i
2:20decided to go ahead and do the rest of my face first I never do that but that's
2:24what i'm doing and i'm going to use this pro bronze fusion bronzer I believe
2:29that's what it's called
2:30and i'm pretty sure this one is in the shape 20 mm it's my favorite one because
2:34it has the coolest undertone the other ones are a lot more warm the other ones
2:40are amazing too but this one is perfect for contouring so I am contouring my
2:46face using a morphe brush from their elite collection
2:50you do have to build these bronzers up but they apply perfectly it's not
2:55powdery at all
2:56it's one of the best bronzer formulations i have ever seen
3:00and then i decided i wanted a little bit more contoured - like that brush with a
3:04little bit too fat so I picked up with the makeup geek chiseled face brush it's
3:09one of our new brushes and it gives you that very chiseled contour look and feel
3:13in it
3:14I like this brush so far so for blush I'm using this cream brush cream brush
3:20while
3:20no cream at blush it's a vibrant but oh my gosh I cannot be today is a vibrant
3:26pink but i like it with this makeup look and it's not too intense
3:30i'm applying it with a real techniques setting brush
3:34I believe this is in the shade - 10 or 220 but i will have everything down
3:37below
3:39hey i'm just applying a very soft layer I don't want too much you know now
3:43taking the pro sculpting duo in 01 first time taking a stippling brush and
3:49applying it into the bronzer just to warm up my face a little bit because I
3:53didn't want to add just a little bit of warm you know since the bronzer was a
3:57little bit more on the cool side
3:58then I'm dipping myself for a fan brush into with the highlight shade which is
4:03the stoner of this little duo it's a nice frosty pinky pearly shading it
4:08really love it
4:10so that is my highlight and then I'm just gonna go ahead and jump into the
4:12eyes
4:13so I'm using all of the Makeup Forever artists eye shadows today and the first
4:17I should i am using is M 548 and i'm using this on a more feed crease brush
4:22to just apply into my crease you know the drill my transition shade and now my
4:27favorite
4:28it's probably I'm not gonna lie my favorite make up for ever eyeshadow ever
4:33it's such a pretty like eggplant purple and this one is m 9 28 and I'm applying
4:39this with an out brush on my entire I and i am working in sections like i'm
4:44applying it little by little because I wanted that full on color so I'm just
4:47packing it on and taking my time
4:49then on a smaller crease brush with like no additional product
4:53I'm just blending out any harsh lines that like the purple created
4:59then I want to take one of my other favorites from the artists eye shadow
5:04line and i believe it's called pinky brown on sephora but it's a really
5:09pretty piggy brown
5:11yes the numbering is M 500 and 600 yes m600 and i'm using this in my crease
5:18with a mac 217 just to blow it out and then I'm going right back into the
5:23purple and just intensifying it because once you start of blending other colors
5:28in the crease the lid shade kind of disappears a little bit
5:32so as you can see i'm going back and forth with those two colors just to
5:36intensify everything and then I'm taking that same vanilla shade i use to set my
5:40concealer and i'm using that as a brow bone highlight and then I'm taking
5:44something a little bit shimmery ER because everything is so mad I wanted
5:48the problem just have a little bit of shimmer and I used
5:51I for one for for that now in a pencil brush i'm applying this to my lower lash
5:56line and then I remembered oh I wanted to put eyeliner and i forgot to do that
6:00well this is a Make Up For Ever eyeliner in brown and i'm just applying that on
6:05my waterline and then I'm going right back to doing what I was doing earlier
6:09so this is like a more feed pencil brush and i just applied that purple all
6:13across my lower lash line then taking a bigger pencil brush and dipping into
6:18pinky brown and just look in that out
6:21so for liner i am using this graphic liner actually bought this with the
6:25Christian Grey or like 50 shades of grey collection i bought like during
6:28christmas and now is when I'm getting around to using it is so black
6:33so i just applied my typical like small little wing and then i'm going to load
6:38on the mascara this is the smoky lash mascara
6:41no smokey extravagant mascara and then i am using that same shade i used under my
6:48brow bone the I for one for just to intensify my inner corners so we are
6:55almost done but now to do the lips I'm taking this lip liner in the shade 1c
7:01and I am lining my lips and then filling in my lips as well and then I wanted
7:05something a little bit more on the cool side like I wanted a cool tones lips i'm
7:09using this aqua rouge it's a liquid lipstick basically and this one is in
7:13the shade number one it's like a super gray cool tone liquid lipstick so I only
7:19. in some in the center and then blend it out with my finger just to make it a
7:23cool to lip but not like super grade so that completes the slick I hope you guys

0:29the look i am wearing in my previous video the very favorites video and a
0:34bunch of the guys said you wanted to see a tutorial on it
0:36so here I am what I like so much about this look is that it's literally so easy
0:42there's no wing no eyeliner
0:44nothing too dramatic it is a nice simple bronzy look and i love that because the
0:49naked 3 palette is full of nice rosy pinky color so you wouldn't think of
0:55doing a look so warm and chocolaty and bronzy but you can now obviously there
1:00are some rosy undertones and this look like you could definitely see the Pink's
1:04kind of popping through but that's because you know it's a prank palette
1:08but you've been wanting to do a nice bronzy look with the naked 3
1:12I hope you enjoyed this one so if you want to see how to get this look just
1:17keep watching
1:18ok so to prime my eyes I'm using the Urban Decay primer potion

1:48so I'm going to take my naked 3 palette and I'm going to go into the shade
1:51nooner
1:52and i'm going to use this in my crease with a mac 217
1:55just to blend out that base we just put down
2:05I'm going to build the color slowly and take it a little bit far past my crease
2:12then I'm going to go into the color trick and I'm going to use my mac fix+
2:17just intensify this eyeshadow a little bit more and then i'm going to apply
2:20this all over my lid right up to the crease
2:31the next color I'm using it this one called factory and i'm using this one
2:35because it does have a lot of brown to it so it's really going to complement
2:38that gold color and i'm just going to take this on my - 17 and slightly blend
2:43it into my crease while putting it on my outer V as well i'm also going to be
2:49taking a smaller flat shader brush this one's from coastal sense and i'm just
2:54gonna be packing that same color onto my outer V and then bringing it into my
2:58crease and i'm using this brush to just get a little bit more precise than the
3:02217
3:03going back into my - 17 with no additional product I'm just going to
3:07blend everything into my crease now with a tiny little brush I'm going to take
3:11the color black heart and i'm just going to add this really close to my lashes
3:14but on the outer V of my eye
3:17so right in the middle i'm just going to drag it all the way to the end and this
3:20is going to make like an imaginary eyeliner look but it's not going to be
3:24as harsh
3:25then I'm just going to highlight with the color strange and i'm going to use
3:28that under my brow bone and in my tear duct as well for my mascara i am using
3:33the jordana best lash extreme
3:36I'm gonna go on to the rest of my face before I finish up underneath my eyes
3:41so I'm going to prime my face with the law real miracle blur and i'm only going
3:45to add this to places where i think i need it
3:48I'm not going to put this all over my face and said it's pretty thick
3:53yeah
3:56the foundation I'm using is the revlon colorstay what foundation in 250 medium
4:01beige and I'm going to use my real techniques sponge to apply it
4:06this is a pretty thick foundation so I like using a sponge to apply it and
4:10bends it out and gives it a little bit more of a dewy finish
4:20then I'm going to take my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser
4:24and i'm going to highlight my face and cover my dark circles
4:30yeah
4:39then I'm going to take my Real Techniques contour blush to blend all
4:43that out

4:58to set that area underneath my eyes and using the fit me powder in 135 creamy
5:03natural
5:11underneath my eyes I'm going to take a tiny little brush and I'm going to dip
5:14it into the color factory and i'm just going to run this underneath my lashes
5:18I didn't use eyeliner or anything like that you can go ahead and do that if you
5:21want it to be a little bit more dramatic but i liked the way it looked without
5:24eyeliner and i'm going to take my little clinic bottom lash mascara and i'm going
5:30to apply this to my bottom lashes
5:34now i'm just going to bronze up my face a little bit and I'm going to use the
5:37NYC son and bronze in the shade Montauk bronze with my real techniques blush
5:41brush and I'm just gonna pretty much
5:43so this all over my face
5:55yeah
5:59for my blush i am using meet our amazonian clay blush in the color
6:03exposed with my it cosmetics blush brush

6:16bronzer intiki and i'm just going to highlight my cheekbones down the bridge
6:20of my nose and a little bit above my lip for lipstick
6:24i'm using this extremely white lipstick from Maybelline called bear at all
6:29no it's called bear all pretty sure yeah and it is way too white for me so I just
6:34like to dab a little bit on my lips to make them more nude to top it off i'm
6:37going to use the buxom lip gloss in white russian and then that complete
6:41this makeup tutorial
6:42thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already
6:45and I will see you in my next one
0:17hey guys so today's video is another tutorial on these roles gold eyes it's
0:23very very fast and simple to daytime appropriate
0:27so the first thing I'm going to do is prime my eyelids and then I'm going to
0:30take the color limit and i'm going to buff this into my crease
0:37I'm going back and forth with this I really want this color to show up in my
0:40crease
0:41I have a cold like what I sound horrible
0:44now i'm taking this color here called trick and that is the really pretty
0:48rolls gold shade in the palette it's probably my dear I shadow but as you can
0:52see the pigmentation isn't the best so I'm just going to take some pics + wear
0:57that on my brush and then apply this to my lids and the fix plus really really
1:03intensify the eyeshadow and just makes it look like literally rose gold and it
1:07gives it like a nice Sheen to it
1:09i love how it looks with some fixed bless you can even use like I drop sir
1:13yeah then I'm taking the color nooner and then I'm just packing this on to my
1:18outer V and then I'm bringing this into the crease
1:25I want to be like nice and diffused and blown out that new new shade is so
1:29beautiful so I'm packing a lot of that into my crease then i'm taking the color
1:35factory and I'm going to put this underneath my lower lashes
1:40oh why my sig
1:44I hope I'm sorry that these are all voice overs but it's just I don't know
1:49then I'm going to take nooner that shade i used my crease and then blend out my
1:53lower lash line as well i'm thinking the lightest shade in the palette and this
1:57is going to be my brow bone highlight and my inner corner highlight then
2:01adding some morphic splash on my 6 plus on my brush I'm going to pack some of
2:06that trick color onto the inner part of my eye on the bottom lash line just to
2:10brighten it up a little bit then i'm just adding some mascara and that's
2:15pretty much it for the eyes and don't want to add eyeliner or winged liner
2:18anything like that since this is a daytime look
2:21and for my face I wanted to keep it very very very simple so honestly I just
2:26bronze my face a little bit using some physicians formula bronzer and that i
2:32didn't contour anything just warmed up my cheeks a little bit
2:38for my lips I'm using this Maybelline nude lipstick in blushing beige that I
2:42got recently and I swear it's like the most beautiful nude color in the world
2:46but i thought i was just like a little bit to New not to nude but i just wanted
2:51a little bit more pink
2:53so I took the Maybelline Color whisper and pedal rebel and I just add that on
2:58top just to give it a more pinky nude color and that's pretty much it
3:04like I said it was super quick thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see
3:07you in my next one bye
0:25ok so today's video is going to be a double tutorial i don't think i've ever
0:33done something like this but it's been so requested to continue to do tutorials
0:38using the Too Faced chocolate bar palette so i thought i would combine two
0:42in one
0:43this is the first look right here this would look really nice for spring it's
0:47just like a very dewy fresh look
0:50no liner no falsies it's something that's very very simple but it has like
0:56that pop of purple and it's just a little bit different than like a day to
0:59day look
1:00but it is perfect for daytime so if you want to see how to get look number one
1:04then just keep watching
1:05ok so i've already primed my eyelids and the first color I'm going in is with
1:09milk chocolate i'm using the beauty by Rosita brush and I'm just buffing this
1:14into my crease to create a nice little transition shade so all the colors can
1:18blend nicely on top
1:20I'm going into candied violet with a flat shader brush and I'm applying this
1:24to the outer corner of my eye and the inner corners of my i'm gonna leave the
1:28center of my lid blank because i'm going to go over it with another shadow
1:33by the way I'm losing my voice I don't know what it is yeah I don't know life
1:38I guess so i'm thinking candied violet like a very little amount of candy
1:43violet and I'm just buffing some of that into my crease so that it all flows
1:47together and I'm just intensifying you know that candied violets a moat
1:57now i'm going to go in with salted caramel i love this shadow it's probably
2:01my favorite in the palette and I'm just adding this to my crease to warm up the
2:06look a little bit and to just blend everything together now
2:12marzipan which is my other favorite in this palette and I'm applying this
2:15directly in the center of the lid
2:17wherever I didn't apply candy violet that's where i'm applying this and I'm
2:21just with the same brush just mixing them together so that they blend nicely
2:25into one another and then i just added some more salted caramel into my crease
2:31to highlight underneath my brow bone i took a white chocolate and then i'm
2:36going to go in with marzipan and i'm going to mix it with champagne truffle
2:39I'm gonna dip my brush into both of these shadows and i'm going to use that
2:43as my inner corner highlight
2:45yes ok now I'm going to take my room scandalize nude eyeliner and i'm going
2:51to apply this to my waterline I wanted a nude liner so that my eyes can look a
2:55little bit bigger and more fresh and then I took some candied violet and I
2:59applied it underneath my lashes and then I took salted caramel and bust it
3:04together
3:05I didn't show the shadows I don't know why but I just used candied violet and
3:09salted caramel and then i apply to some pico extra sculpt volume mascara and
3:14that completely eyes it was a very very simple
3:17I look I already have my foundation and my concealer and my powder on my face
3:21because I didn't want this video to be too long but i do want to show you
3:24really quickly
3:26the other products are used in my face so I'm just browsing up my skin with my
3:30Too Faced milk chocolate soleil bronzer i'm using the Knicks fan brush I believe
3:35that school is cold to highlight my face i'm going to take crushed pearls from
3:39the Anasazi aglow kit
3:41this is like the pinky er located I really really really love it
3:45it's amazing i'm just using crushed pearls to have first row
3:49yes to highlight tops of my cheekbones and my nose to get extra highlighting
3:54and glowy for blush i am taking the wet and wild ombre blush in the shade
4:00might I buy you a drink pretty sure that's the name of the blush it will be
4:04listed below
4:05it's a very sheer blush but it is
4:07really really pretty now i'm taking the econometrics waterproof nude lipliner
4:12this is called nude buff or buff nude and i'm filling in my entire lips with
4:17this I did overlined my lips
4:19I did it intentionally i wanted my life to look extra county and like bigger but
4:23don't do it if you don't like that
4:25I just you know want to change it up now i'm going in with the Makeup Forever
4:28plexiglass
4:30this is in the shade too old to this is a very thick but very glossy lip gloss
4:35so I want my lips to look glossy so that's what I did so that completes look
4:39number one very free daytime fresh
4:42I really love it if you want to see how to get look number two then let's jump
4:46right into that
4:47so I've already prime my lids and now i'm going in with milk chocolate on a
4:52fluffy blending brush and I'm just buffing this on the outer corners and
4:55then dragging it into my crease now taking this really pretty shimmery
5:05cranberry shade called amaretto and i'm applying this to my entire lid just like
5:11a flat shader brush
5:12I'm taking all the way up to my crease but I'm not passing my crease I just
5:15want it on my lid
5:17I wanted a little bit more in this eyeshadow so I took some mac fix+ and I
5:24sprayed it on my brush and then i went in with it like that and you can see
5:28that it just like intensifies the eyeshadow a lot more makes it look a
5:32little bit more metallic and foiled i recommend dipping your brush into the
5:36eyeshadow first and then spring 6 plus so you don't mess up your eyeshadow but
5:40yes that is what I did
5:42now I took the shade semi-sweet in the palette and on a skinnier and skinnier
5:47but like smaller blending brush
5:49I am just buffing this into my crease because i wanted the amaretto to blood
5:54nicely into my transition shape so I'm just using that to blend all the colors
5:58together
5:59and then I took a big fluffy brush and blend it some more
6:03you know no harsh lines I'm going into the shade cherry cordial it's such a
6:10pretty like Matt reddish color but it does have a little bit of glitter
6:13doesn't really translate on the lid much but it is stunning i love it so I'm just
6:18packing that onto the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging it into my
6:22crease a little bit so i took this essence smoky cool eyeliner in black and
6:27i'm just using this on my waterline and then I went back into the cherry cordial
6:33shade that map read and I am bluffing this on my lower lash line
6:37this is so pretty on the lower lash line I just I love red shades like this
6:42so with a pencil brush this is a more feet pencil brush I'm just buffing that
6:46on my lash line
6:47so breaking I love it then I went into hazelnut this color is so beautiful it's
6:52like a warm bronze shade
6:55I'm just buffing that on my lower lash line so that it's not too harsh under
6:59there and it's not like just a line of cherry cordial
7:02that makes sense yeah I just mix it in with a little bit he's not now I went
7:06into this essence cold again and i'm applying this really really really close
7:11to my top lashes and then blending it out with a pencil brush just to create a
7:15little bit of smokiness right at the base of the lashes but I didn't want to
7:19apply eyeliner
7:20that's a good little trick so now i'm going to highlight my brow bone and my
7:24inner corners i'm using a champagne truffle on my inner corners and then I
7:28used white chocolate underneath my brow bone so I went in with some mascara i
7:34use the Elizabeth ma it's so big mascara and then i apply some are dealt with
7:38bees in the shade 602 on my lashes it's a very natural fall / which is what i
7:43wanted and like before I have already foundation concealer and powder on but
7:49i'm going to show you the extra steps I took i'm taking my physicians formula
7:53butter bronzer and I'm not really contouring i'm just really warming up my
7:56face
7:57i'm using the two-faced mr. Wright brush
8:00it's like a tulip shaped brush it's amazing so just warming up the skin you
8:04know
8:04you know the drill I took my to face love blush in the shade baby love
8:10I didn't show you the blush like the actual blush but it's just a really
8:13pretty nude color and then to highlight my face
8:16i'm using the makeup revolution aight highlighter in the shade radiant light
8:21it's kind of like a soft pinky highlight but it's so natural and beautiful i love
8:26it so inexpensive this is a great highlight some just highlight of my face
8:30with that and then for my lip
8:32I'm taking the colour-pop ultra satin lip in the shade magic wand it's
8:37probably my favorite ultra satin lip they have
8:40it's so natural and perfect for everyday it goes with so many looks and i've been
8:44loving this formula so i just applied that to my entire lips no lip liner or

1:54palette i'm going to take this super Toby purplish kind of color and on that
1:59same brush I'm going to just do the exact same things so on the outer V and
2:03then bring it into my crease
2:04i'm using these two shades to kind of you know create some dimension and so it
2:09you know has different colors of that makes sense I'm going to take this
2:13little trail from one wild walking on eggshells trio and i'm mixing those two
2:18shades that was pointing at
2:19and i'm going to apply this on the inner half of my lid using this else brush is
2:23in one dollar brush and then i'm going to dip my fluffy brush again into the
2:29pink and i'm just going to blend everything out
2:32sorry I feel like I'm moving for that
2:34I'm going to dip that same elf brush into the white
2:37I'm really packing it into the white and applying this to my brow bone as a
2:41highlight
2:42I'm going to take this darker brown in the palette it's also very cool tone but
2:47i'm applying this right at the outer view my to create a darkness on the
2:50outer corners
2:52this is just a darker Brown than the other ones we were using and then I'm
2:57going to use my NYC liquid liner and i'm going to apply a very thick wing
3:01so what I like to do is I like to draw the line first and then do this and then
3:06fill it in
3:07so I do that kind of wing first and then I start brushing a little strokes in the
3:12end or corners just to connect everything and then
3:15yeah i got out of frame but all he did was fill in that part that makes sense
3:21I really suck at eyeliner but I just did my typical wing I go back and I fix it
3:26but i just did like a basic thick wing do whatever you guys want you don't have
3:30to do that so I primary face with a luminous primer and then i'm going to
3:34mix these two foundations
3:36this is the Maybelline fit me and the maybelline fit me matte and poreless I
3:41like to mix these two because i have dry skin
3:43so sometimes the fit me the original is a little bit to do it which I do love
3:47but mixing it with the new matte and poreless creates a beautiful like
3:51natural satin finish I love this combination and i'm using a small
3:55stiffer brush
3:57tiful know a small stipple brush from ELF because you have to work in sections
4:01with the matte and poreless because it dries really really fast and then I
4:06realized I had no hearings on sale
4:08so I'm just working in sections and i love this brush it gets in the mix and
4:12crannies of everything i don't know i really like it so that's what I'm doing
4:15then I'm gonna add some concealer to my under eyes this is the LA girl Pro
4:19conceal in natural and then i'm going to highlight some more so I'm using the
4:25Rimmel conceal and highlight little lighter concealer things and i'm going
4:30to apply this all over my face to highlight my face as well
4:37i'm going to use this brush from hell this is there a tapered highlighter
4:41brush and I'm going to use that to blend in a ball and I really love about
4:45brushes the studio line is really a portable and really soft like very soft
4:50I love there so I'm just letting that all in then I'm going to take my
4:54Maybelline and fit me powder in 135 from natural and I'm gonna set my concealer
4:58on my face but to set my under eye can see there i'm using this elf under I
5:03setting powder
5:04I like it because it's like light reflecting reminds me a lot of the laura
5:08mercier secret brightening powder but it's three dollars and not like a
5:12million then after that I'm gonna finish off my eyes and I'm going to take that
5:17same liquid liner and now i'm going to start a connecting this into the inner
5:21part of my eye doesn't make sense
5:22I'm making like a little triangle right in the inner tear duct and usually I
5:26don't add eyeliner there but i think it creates like a sexy cat eye look
5:30as you can see right there so that is what I didn't feel like it ties the
5:35eyeliner together really nicely and after that i'm going to take some black
5:39eyeliner i have been loving this from nicks it's there like gel eyeliner in
5:43black its new looks like their new eyeliner
5:46it's amazing guys it's a super black look so black I really love it
5:51I'm gonna take this equal tools angled brush and I'm going to dip it into the
5:55black eyeshadow and i'm going to set the eyeliner like bringing it really really
5:59really really close to my waterline and yeah it's just going to intensify the
6:02eyeliner on the lower
6:04- line after that I applied mascara to my top and bottom lashes and then i went
6:09in with some red cherry or fifteen lashes just finish off the I look I'm
6:14gonna tip this more feet crease brush into that brown shade and I'm just gonna
6:19keep it up the outer corner like that like I'm just going to apply it really
6:22softly right in the outer V kind of in the crease and I feel like it's just
6:27going to add a little bit more dimension and finish off the eyes
6:30so then i'm going to go ahead and do the rest of my makeup just my face makeup
6:34I'm gonna take this NYX high-definition blush in the shade
6:38taupe and i'm going to use this to contour this is al
6:42what is a powder brush from ELF like a I think it's like a powder foundation
6:47brush and i love it for contouring because it's not too small but it's not
6:51too big
6:52this is a very a she blushed I got to be color very a she's so perfect for
6:57contouring but just to warm up the skin a little bit not too much
7:01i'm gonna tip that same brush into my NYC son and bronzer bronzer in Montauk
7:07bronze just gonna warm it up a little bit because that taupe blush is like
7:11great like hella gray like super super a she's so you do have to be a little bit
7:15careful
7:18after that I'm going to take this beautiful like to love style brush from
7:21Delhi I'm tools and i'm going to use this to apply my blush
7:24this is the next High Definition blush in soft-spoken i believe i will leave
7:28all the information in the description box
7:31it's a really pretty light peachy color love this blush then of course the
7:36highlight my physician formula shimmer strip in naturally new and i'm applying
7:42that with an elf blush brush to the tops of my cheekbones and on the bridge of my
7:46nose
7:48and all that good stuff and I'm just going to do my lips this is the Rimmel
7:52exaggerate the liner in natural i believe it's what it's called and the
7:57reason i'm applying this lip liner is because the lipstick , to put on top
7:59looks awful without a lip liner underneath because it settles into my
8:04lines really badly
8:05none of the rest of those lipsticks and that line do but that one kind of
8:08settles
8:09but i love the color so i have to put a lip liner underneath and i'm using the
8:13Milani moisture matte lipstick and match innocence
8:16hey guys that completes the look I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
8:21you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I
8:24will see you in my next video bye
0:17hey guys so today's a makeup tutorial is on this look right here it's like the
0:22most simplest look ever mainly wanted to do this video because i used the
0:31Maybelline Dream bronze a BB cream
0:34this product is like pretty new and I decided to take inspiration from it so i
0:38did like a very tanned skin bronzy makeup actually pretty tired of having a
0:44fresh tan on
0:46I don't know if my lights are showing that I mainly wanted to focus this
0:49tutorial on the face like a very bronze glowy face
0:53so the eyes are very very simple very basic
0:56i'm actually going to talk about this a little bit more at the end of the video
1:00so if you want a review on this product just stay tuned to after the tutorial
1:05and if you want to see how to get these little then just keep watching
1:09ok so I'm a fool and I didn't show you guys what I'm a mixing or what i'm using
1:16but I mix the Maybelline Dream pur BB cream and with the Maybelline Dream
1:22bronze BB cream like I showed you earlier i mix those two together because
1:26the bronze one on its own is a little bit
1:29- bronze so I wanted to mix in one with like more of a flesh tone or one closer
1:34to my face and then I realized in this clip that i didn't put on primer but
1:39that's okay
1:40this kind of work to the primer and a BB cream all in one but that glow girl look
1:47at that glow
1:47some intense bronze venus I like it
1:51so yeah Here I am showing you the two things that I mixed
1:57i'm thinking the NYX HD concealer in the shade of beige and i'm applying this
2:01underneath my eyes to kind of highlight and cover up my dark circles as well i'm
2:06playing out to my eyes as well to kind of use it as a primer and eyeshadow base
2:11i'm highlighting other parts of my face - like I always do that i'm going to
2:16take this dream lumi concealer and i'm going to apply that all over the areas
2:21that I applied that concealer because that can see there is kind of thick so
2:24applying this on top not only helps highlight but it kind of makes it easier
2:28to blend out that nyx concealer and of course blending that with my favorite
2:37concealer blending brush this is the sedona lace
2:40- 17
2:46yeah
2:58yeah
3:03now i'm gonna take the maybelline fit me powder in 135 creamy natural
3:09I cannot find 135 anywhere i hope they didn't discontinued because it's my
3:13favorite setting powder under the eyes from the drugstore and if they
3:16discontinued it will be very sad
3:18yes i'm just using that I want to take this bourgeois bronzing primer it's
3:22amazing look at it beautiful
3:24it's very similar to this Chanel too late and a Chanel whatever that's called
3:28it's very similar it's just like a mu see consistency and it's a nice warm
3:32bronzy color so i'm using my Real Techniques sculpting brush to just
3:37bronze up my face I'm not trying to like do any harsh contouring since this is a
3:40warmer bronzer
3:41I'm just giving myself more of a tan you no more war me
3:52this is a seal of blush
3:57what is this called what is called was called this is the Aqua glow water color
4:03blush and this is in the shade
4:05shimmering lotus I like to apply on the back of my hand first because it can get
4:08a little pins and then apply it to my cheeks is basically like a liquid blush
4:14it's not even a cream it's like a pure liquid blush it's kind of awesome
4:18I really like it's really pretty if you get used to like you have to get used to
4:22blending it out since it's so weird cause it's like a liquid out of them
4:25this is the Milani bronzer in the shade glow i use this more kind of like a warm
4:31blush because it's a bronzer but it has a little bit of pink to it and it's very
4:35shimmery it's actually really really pretty
4:38especially in the summertime I'm going to move on to my eyes I want to keep it
4:42very very simple so i'm using the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade glow a
4:47nice
4:47like when the shade i'm using this to highlight underneath my brow bone using
4:53a morphing brush not sure what that one is called I think it's the e 14
4:58maybe i'm also applying that in beach like in my tear duct area as well then
5:04I'm going to take the shade Cornelius by the way these both of these eyeshadows
5:07are from my collab with color pop the where the light is quad
5:12oh yeah i'm taking Cornelius and i'm applying this to my entire lid
5:21yeah
5:25I'm dragging that underneath my lower lash line as well this is a very very
5:29natural color but like i said i wanted to keep it very simple
5:33I'm going to take a fluffy brush to get right back into Cornelius and then apply
5:37this to my crease to kind of diffuse the look and just bring it up higher
5:48yeah
5:49I'm gonna take this milani Bella eyeshadow in the shade fellowship on
5:54such as stunning like white gold and our planet in my inner tear ducts and
5:59everything else is so mad i want a very bright in the corner then I'm going to
6:04take this
6:05a
6:06it was gone oh the kat von d ink liner
6:09I believe this is in the shame
6:12actually I have it here let me check to do this is in the shade Hemingway so i'm
6:18applying this really really close to my lash line as if i was going to wing it
6:22out but I actually don't get out I just create a line and i like it because it's
6:26brown it's not as harsh and then i'm going to apply two coats of my L'Oreal
6:32telescopic mascara and I also applied that to my bottom lashes for my lips I'm
6:37keeping it very very simple i'm just using the anastacio lip gloss in the
6:41shade and dressed and that's all I'm doing for my lips
6:45so yeah now if you want to see a readme review on the BB cream
6:49just keep watching so if you're watching this part of the video that you want my
6:56little review on this product I didn't want to do a whole separate review on
6:59this since i have that cover girl foundation review up and I don't like to
7:04review so much i like this product this is the second time i use it the first
7:10time I used it completely by itself and it wasn't my favorite because it's dark
7:15I have the 14 light to medium skin tones
7:19um and it's like a medium
7:22I wouldn't say it's for light to medium if you are super fair i recommend using
7:25this as a bronzer like as a cream bronzer or you can use this mixed in
7:31which is how i like to use it and if you are really really dark skin
7:34I think they might have deeper ones so the way that I like to use this is mixed
7:39with foundations when I'm tan because it is a bronzer kind of I like to mix it in
7:44like today I mix it in with my dream cure BB cream to get like a more light
7:48weight coverage and it works really really well this way
7:52I don't like the original BB cream the Maybelline by like this one has
7:55salicylic acid and it's it's good
7:57oh yeah this would be awesome if you want super jennifer lopez skin
8:01SI lo as superintendent for Lopez skin but you have a very very matte
8:06foundation so mixing in a little bit of this is just going to make it really
8:09dewy and bronzy I kind of really love that about this
8:12I like it to mix by itself no you could also use this like on top of your
8:17foundation just to kind of like bronzed up the skin like a liquid bronzer
8:21so I really like this idea I actually kind of love it
8:25I think it's really good i've only used it twice but i'm playing around with it
8:28and i really like how it's been working for me so i highly recommend it
8:31only if you have normal to dry skin oily skin stay away from this unless you're
8:36using it in certain areas as browser
8:38so yeah that is my quick little mini review I hope you guys enjoyed this look
8:42thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
8:45and I will see you in my next video
0:25hey guys so I am currently in a storm the power has almost gone out like four
0:32times so I'm like hanging by a string right now hoping that the power doesn't
0:37get cut off so that at least this lamp can illuminate me somewhat but today's
0:42video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right now
0:46it was perfectly sunny when i started doing this tutorial than halfway through
0:50it
0:51it started to pour like a mother and I like my power almost went out like i
0:56said and it was just it and I would have just stopped recording i would have
1:00filmed this tomorrow but i was already like doing my makeup and I was like
1:03they're my peeps most subscribers are my peeps they're not going to care if it's
1:07a little dark
1:08they never do because I'm always complaining about it and you guys are
1:11really nice about it huh
1:13it was an epic lightning no and I was waiting for the thunder but notice way I
1:20wanted to do a really deep smoky eye like a suitable for clubbing and stuff
1:25like that but since it is summertime I wanted to incorporate color as well so
1:29it is very dark and dramatic and klemish but it's also colorful - it's not your
1:35basic like a deep black silver look it's kind of fun and has a good twist to it
1:39colorful I like it anyway if you want to see a tutorial on this makeup look
1:43then you can go ahead
1:45keep watching so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to prime my eyes I'm
1:50using Urban Decay primer potion and then i'm gonna take a piece of scotch tape
1:54put on the back of my hand first and then put it right next to my I to create
1:59like a sharp cat eye effect i am taking my Urban Decay Naked basics palette and
2:04I'm taking the color called naked - I believe it's called and i'm just going
2:08to be applying this in my crease buffing this color in dipping my brush and
2:13little by little and just building up that color
2:15this is just going to work as a transition shade so that everything
2:18blend well then I'm going to take my NYX jumbo pencil in black bean
2:23I'm going to put this all over my lid and then blend it out with my finger
2:29for this tutorial i am using the Urban Decay electric palette i'm going to take
2:34the little brush that comes the palette and I'm dipping it into the color freak
2:39and I'm going to apply this to the inner part of my I just focusing it mainly
2:43near the tear duct area
2:51then I'm going to take this color right here it is called fringe is a beautiful
2:54teal and on the other side of the brush I'm going to apply this to my entire lid
2:59and putting black as a base is really going to make this eyeshadow stand out
3:03its gonna make it like a deep sea foam teal kind of color i don't know i really
3:07love how this looks right on top of black
3:09so yeah i'm just applying this to my whole lid right up to the crease then
3:15I'm gonna take a fluffy brush with no additional product and i'm just going to
3:18start blending out those edges
3:23yeah
3:28then I'm going to take a mac 217 brush and dip it into naked - from the Urban
3:32Decay basics palette and I'm going to start blending this out even more
3:37this is the type of look that does look kind of ugly and messy before it starts
3:41to look pretty but don't worry about it just keep truck in and keep blending and
3:45it'll all turn out just fine
3:46I'm gonna take this one right here called faint and i'm just going to blend
3:50some more like I said this is a lot a lot of blending because the colors are
3:54so vibrant and pigmented you want to make sure you blend them out nicely then
3:58I'm going to go back into the fluffy brush and just blend out the harsh edges
4:01and then because of all that blending some of the color did go away obviously
4:07so I'm just going to take that fringe color again and apply it to my entire
4:11lid and then I'm going to do the same with the free color
4:19now with my mac 217 i'm actually dipping it into the color fringe which is the
4:23blue one we put on the entire lid and i'm going to add some of this to my
4:26crease
4:32and then a fluffy brush with no additional product and just blending
4:37some more
4:38lots and lots of blending to highlight i am going to take the highlight shade in
4:44The Naked basics palette and apply underneath my brow bone and in my inner
4:47tear duct
4:49i'm going to create a thin wing and i am using the bombs showing eyeliner and its
4:53really good to use tape when it comes to doing a wing because it's foolproof and
4:57its really really easy the tape is going to act as a guideline
5:00so you just want to add a wing and even though it looks messy when you take the
5:02tape off it's nice and sharp so I'm just going to add a thin little wing
5:16then I'm going to take my Maybelline master drama eyeliner as always and I'm
5:19going to tight line with this
5:23yeah
5:28I'm going to take a flat shader brush and I'm going to take the black and the
5:30Naked basics palette and I'm going to start packing this really really close
5:34to the tape
5:35I wanted to be the darkest right at the edge of the tape so I'm just going to
5:40pack that color and then start dragging it towards the inner part of my eye so
5:44it's nice and faded
5:50and the color little by little so it's not too harsh
5:54then I'm just going to take off the tape and you see it's nice and sharp and with
5:58a white be i'm just going to clean up any fallout
6:01moving onto my face i'm using the chafing really powder gel and i'm going
6:06to use this as a primer yes it is for mana stats but its silicone base and
6:10it's good for your pores and stuff so that's what i'm using for my foundation
6:13i am using my l'oreal true match foundation and three natural buff and my
6:18trusty handy-dandy Real Techniques bunch
6:22I keep forgetting what this is called I think it's like an miracle complexion
6:25sponge i'm not i don't remember but seriously guys this sponge is amazing if
6:33you don't own it already i recommend it it's very affordable it's very
6:36comparable to the Beauty Blender and i love it
7:02I'm going to move onto concealer and i am using my Maybelline fit me concealer
7:05and 15 fair and i'm just gonna apply this underneath my eyes to cover my dark
7:10circles and to highlight a little bit
7:11I always do this step but you know the usual
7:21I'm not very careful when I do this I just make sure that my under eye area is
7:25nice and concealed and highlighted and then i'm going to first blend it out
7:27with the sponge and then i'm going to further blend it out with my Real
7:31Techniques contour brush
7:42to set it i'm going to use my Mac emphasize powder and this is just going
7:46to set the concealer so that it does not crease
7:51so moving on to the eyes again i'm going to take my Maybelline master drama
7:54eyeliner in midnight master and i'm going to use this on my waterline then
8:00I'm going to take this fake color again and I'm going to run this underneath my
8:04lower lash line all the way to my inner tear duct and I'm sorry it is really
8:08dark this is when I started pouring like crazy
8:11so again I apologize i'm gonna add some mascara to my top and bottom lashes this
8:15is the clinical lash doubling mascara and then i'm going to apply my red
8:19cherry lashes in 747 and more
8:22yeah 747 mmm i love these lashes they're amazing
8:25so yeah then I'm going to smell my bronzer apparently this is the too faced
8:30chocolate soleil bronzer
8:31it smells like chocolate and it's really good and I am just going to apply this
8:36all over my face contouring a little bit just rounding up my face
8:40this bronzer is so pigmented that you can get pretty heavy pretty quickly so
8:45just use a light hand with it
8:47i'm using my ELF complexion brush
8:50I believe that's what it's called and then I'm just going to apply this to my
8:53neck and underneath my chin as well
8:56for blush I'm using my NYX blush in the shade mom and being nice
9:01mavi pinky color it's really really pretty and it's light for my highlight
9:06I'm using the bombs mary-lou manizer and i am using my Sigma contour brush to
9:11apply this on my cheekbones
9:14i'm also going to apply this to the bridge of my nose and on my Cupid's well
9:19as well
9:27for my lips I'm using the NYX butter lipstick in the shade fun size and i'm
9:31applying this to my lips and then i'm going to top it off with buck some lip
9:35gloss in White Russian
9:42yeah
9:53elephants combination it gives it like a nice milky glossy pink
9:57I really like it so that is the end of this tutorial thank you guys so much for
10:01watching I really hope you enjoyed it please subscribe if you haven't already
10:04and I will see you in my next video bye
0:15again so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right
0:19now and it is using the brand new Urban Decay Naked 3 palette this is a look
0:24that I was wearing in right naked 3 review and swatches that i posted the
0:29other day and a bunch of you guys said you wanted to see a tutorial on the
0:32makeup i was wearing in the video so you ask and you shall receive
0:36by the way i am going to be doing a few more tutorials with this palette
0:41I've got a bunch of the works they're all cooking in my brain right now so
0:45stay tuned for those videos coming soon
0:47just because I feel like a lot of people have been getting this power recently or
0:51you guys are getting it for Christmas
0:52it's popula it's very popular right now so i figured it'd be really cool to do
0:56just a couple more tutorials with this palette but this tutorial specifically
1:00is a little special because i am doing it with my friend Shireen
1:04she is probably the first person I met on youtube and she was just so nice to
1:08me right off the bat she gave me like a little shout-out in her video when I
1:11have like 25 subscribers and I thought it was the sweetest thing and we text
1:15all the time she has become a really good friend of mine we talk about makeup
1:18all the time we're just like a bunch of girly girls talking back and forth so we
1:22decided it would be a good idea for both of us to upload tutorials using this
1:27palette
1:27she is doing a more daytime appropriate look and this is more like a sultry
1:32evening type of look
1:33i would i would totally wear this during the day but for people who don't like

0:13hey guys so today's video is going to be a quick eye makeup tutorial using color
0:20pop I shadows
0:21this is a top tutorial just because I'm only doing my eye makeup in this video
0:26I'm only doing my eye makeup in this video because I specifically want to
0:29show you how the colour-pop eyeshadows work on me or I wanted to show you this
0:33I look at everything on the rest of my face will be in the description box as
0:37per usual
0:38but anyway if you want to see this nice metallic gold I then just keep watching
0:41my eyebrows look super scary right now because I have nothing else on my face
0:47don't be alarmed ok so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to prime my
0:51eyelids and i'm going to be using the elf glitter primer to do that you don't
0:56only have to use this primer for glitter you can use it for just regular eye
0:59shadows - I find that it really helps out here
1:04your shadows to your eyelids this doesn't look like a tacky feeling to
1:09your eyelids
1:10but I find that these eyeshadows I'm get any skipping you know like if you were
1:13to apply a powder eyeshadow on top of a sticky base
1:16it was kind of like skipping it stuck but these are so light creamy that I
1:19find that they will get stuck
1:21I'm going to start by applying a color to my crease and for that I am
1:24going to take this color right here called smash it
1:28it isn't a matte eyeshadow by any means at all you can see but it isn't glittery
1:33or sparkly so for the crease it gives you a nice finish it does have like a
1:38sheen to it but it
1:39I think it's so pretty for the crease I'm going to take my more feet and b25
1:44brush this is like the perfect brush to apply this eyeshadow with
2:00I just decided to go ahead and do this I and then bring you in closer
2:03ok so next I'm going to take this color right here and it is called get lucky
2:08and it is literally my favorite eyeshadow
2:12out of all the color pop I shall I own it is incredible incredible incredible
2:16definitely recommend using these with your finger as i said in my review
2:23look at that look at that Sheen
2:27oh so good
2:39now i'm just going to take this one again which is the one I used in my
2:42crease taking that brush and blending out that gold a little bit
2:53and then going back in to get lucky and layering it again now because I don't
3:03have an inner corner or brow bone highlight type of color
3:06i'm going to just take my milani Bella eyeshadow in bella chiffon and i'm going
3:11to use that to highlight underneath my route
3:13ok let's get in the frame and it looks white in the pan but it has a beautiful
3:18gold Sheen to it
3:26ok
3:31this also is what I used to highlight my face and I'm just in love with this look
3:35okay and really quickly i'm just going to add a little wing i'm going to use my
3:38NYC liquid eyeliner in my Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner and I'm just gonna a
3:42little wing off camera i also added my Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
3:48midnight master
3:50ok so we are almost time for my lower lash line i'm going to take the color
3:53smash again
3:55and on this outer be brush from makeup geek i am going to run that underneath
4:01my lash line
4:09then I'm gonna take this really fun color it here called I heart this
4:14I need to be in the frame what is wrong with me
4:17it is called I heart this and it is absolutely gorgeous
4:22like out of this world and i'm going to take it on a tiny little brush like this
4:26this is from coastal sense
4:28and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my elf makeup lock and seal and i'm
4:34just going to pour some right onto the brush and then dip it into the product
4:40and this isn't gonna mess up the product at all because it is a cream product
4:43anyway so I'm going to do it right into the product and run that underneath my
4:47lash line and this is just going to intensify the eye shadow
4:51if you don't have this you could use mac fix+ or eye drops that all works the
4:56same
5:03yeah
5:08yeah
5:10you can get quite a bit of fallout with this eyeshadow that's why i usually do
5:13my eyes before but since this wasn't a full tutorial I just did my face makeup
5:17but when you do use eyeshadow i recommend using I'm doing it before your
5:22face makeup but its cord back into this makeup geek out of the brush and just
5:27going to get right back into smash and do that one more time and this time I'm
5:36going to bring it a little bit further down just to make it nice and bronze and
5:41smoky down there now I'm just going to curl my lashes apply some mascara I'm
5:50using mac and extreme dimension 3d blacklash longest night meta
6:01ok guys so that completes its eye makeup tutorial really hope you guys enjoyed it
6:05and maybe you check out the colour-pop eye shadows because they're so expensive
6:08there are five dollars a pop and they are good
6:12thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
6:14and I will see you in my next video
0:31hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look i'm
0:36wearing
0:37I know of course I have had a lot of requests in the past to do a bridal
0:41makeup look
0:41so I decided to do one specifically using the drugstore products and i'm
0:47also using all affordable brushes in this video as well I really really love
0:51this type of makeup and this type of look for weddings but I mean everybody
0:56has different tastes everybody wants to do different things this is just my take
0:59on really soft feminine bridal makeup
1:02by the way i will say this video is going to be a long one because it is a
1:05talk through tutorial actually had to empty on my memory card like almost at
1:11the end of the video so i know it's long i know sorry about that and actually fun
1:16fact that and I didn't have a wedding we couldn't afford one when we got married
1:19so we didn't have like a big wedding but if we would have had a huge like wedding
1:24or like a nice or even a small wedding
1:26this is the makeup I would have done something very very similar to this
1:30even though it is drugstore I would have done something very similar so anyway I
1:33hope you guys enjoy this video and if you want to see how to get this
1:36drugstore bridal little makeup then just keep watching
1:41ok so I'm just gonna get my hair out of my face really quick so I'm going to
1:44start off with eyebrows and normally I would do this step before coming on
1:47camera and filming out tutorial you guys know
1:49this but i have decided to do it on camera for the purpose of this video and
1:55look naked
1:56throughout this video don't I i'm going to be using the elf instant lift a brow
2:00pencil another really good drugstore brow pencil is the Knicks won it looks
2:06really similar to this
2:07it's in a pencil form with a spoolie on the end you guys know I like a bold bra
2:11but I'm gonna try to make my brows a little bit more natural
2:14although i really do love that look I think that a nice feminine brow is
2:18prettier on your wedding day
2:20all I'm doing is following the natural shape of my brows just shading them in a
2:24little bit darker so they look a little bit more visible more prominent
2:28okay so I got a little too bold
2:31all right just fill in your brows the way you are comfortable filling them in
2:36i am going to set them with a brow gel or a brow mascara because this is not
2:42enough on its own i don't think any brow product is enough on its own
2:46you are going to need something that's going to keep it in place all day even
2:49if you don't have long eyebrow hairs
2:51this is really going to make the product underneath it take a lot longer
2:55I always liked how I do my eyebrows the day that I do them on camera I hate them
3:01african hate them i'm going to start working on my face because the eye
3:04makeup i'm doing is really natural and there's not much fallout so I'm gonna do
3:08all my face makeup first
3:10i highly recommend a primer on your wedding day one that is really really
3:14good from the drugstore is the Knicks angel wheel
3:17I find that my makeup does last longer when i use this its oil free and it is
3:20really really really great for all skin types but because i do have really dry
3:25skin
3:26i'm going to add a little bit of the law real magic Lumi primer
3:31I'm going to mix them and i'm gonna apply it to my face like that
3:36yeah
3:42the foundation i'm going to be using today is the revlon colorstay foundation
3:45this is the one for normal to dry skin because the regular I cannot use its way
3:51too cakey and to share out the formula a little bit i am using a damp Real
3:56Techniques complexions fun to these are about seven dollars at ulta or anywhere
4:00they sell real techniques and i'm going to start balancing this onto my skin a
4:05beauty blender or ace wet sponge
4:08Wilshere out the coverage just a little bit and make the foundation look a
4:14little bit more natural on your skin and that's why i recommend if you are
4:18getting married not to use a really thick and cakey foundation because
4:24that's just not really flattering if you need really really full-coverage then
4:28using a beauty blender or a sponge like this will really help that this is a
4:34full coverage foundation but i am actually just applying a shear shear
4:39layer
4:44i'm going to drag it down my neck make sure to drag your foundation down your
4:51neck don't apply it straight to your neck but on just drag it down your neck
4:56so that everything matches better and it doesn't look like you have a foundation
4:59mask
5:00I'm gonna go in with concealer and you can see that i'm going to be using our
5:05the Allegro broken seals you can get this on the LA girl website la girl
5:09usa.com or drugstore com i believe yes i'm going to mix these two shades I'm
5:13gonna mix natural
5:15this is a more peachy color to counteract dark circles and then i'm
5:18going to use creamy beige really hate the packaging on this for me it's hard
5:22to squeeze out product but i'm using this product today in this tutorial
5:26because i find that has really great coverage and it lasts all the on my skin
5:31it doesn't look bad in photography and ice I'm telling you it last forever on
5:35the skin
5:43yeah
5:50just going to add a little bit on the bridge of my nose here and on my chin
5:56I'm not going to highlight anywhere else and I don't want to pack on the
6:00concealer because this is a thicker concealer
6:03so I don't want my skin to look cakey
6:06so I'm just blending this in with a real techniques contour brush
6:11I would normally go for a much lighter concealer underneath my eyes you guys
6:20know to brighten up under there and to look extra in production but you know
6:27for our wedding you don't want that stark white
6:29look underneath your eyes especially in pictures or anything like that
6:39this combo just looks a lot more natural on me
6:43so the next thing you want to do is set your under-eye concealer because if you
6:47don't set it with powder it will crease my favorite drugstore setting powder for
6:51underneath the eyes is the Maybelline fit me i also love this on my entire
6:54face with this shade specifically is for my under eye
6:58it's 135 creamy natural using the Real Techniques setting brush and I'm just
7:04going to set that up
7:12now the next step I wouldn't typically do but for anybody with normal to oily
7:18skin i highly recommend you setting your face with powder
7:20even if you have dry skin it might be a better idea to set your face makeup
7:24because it's just going to make it last longer
7:26i'm going to use the most a matte powder to set my face but i'm going to use a
7:30very very light layer of this
7:33sometimes I find that this can flash back and photography and make my skin
7:37look a little bit white
7:39by the way this the revlon colorstay foundation
7:43I think um the original has SPF but this one doesn't say it has SPF at all
7:50I don't know why the normal to dry skin one doesn't say it has SPF
7:54but if it does or if it doesn't it does not flash back in photography which is
7:57why i really like it
7:58and why would recommend it for like wedding makeup but anyway i'm just going
8:02to take this real techniques blush brush and dab it dab it dab it in ever so
8:08slightly and just set my face
8:15yeah
8:18never looked this matt crazy ok so now i'm going to contour my cheekbones
8:24just a little bit personally for me on your wedding day I don't think that can
8:28cart cart auction that Kim Kardashian structure is very flattering
8:33i'm going to use the elf contour palette and I'm going to use this elf mineral
8:37powder blush brush and I'm going to dip it into this cool tone color right here
8:56I don't know if you can tell what they gave me just a slight contour to this
9:00side of my face and I have a very large forehead is so much in a con call day so
9:06I'm just gonna contour around a little tense and bring it to the other sign and
9:15come forward and just a little bean and then do the same thing here i'm going to
9:25move onto bronzing the skin I contoured but I still want warmth back into my
9:29skin
9:30i'm going to use the physicians formula bronze booster it's probably one of my
9:33favorite drugstore bronzers because it's not a flat matte shade so i'm going to
9:38use a dell IAM tools and
9:42974 brush like a tulip shaped brush you can get these online at the lamb tools
9:48and I am just going to bronze the cheeks not contouring just loving this on my
9:53cheeks
9:54just like I said bronzing the skin
10:06i'm also going to bring this to my jaw line right here
10:10ok so now i'm going to go ahead and add a blush I think this is a beautiful
10:14beautiful beautiful like wedding makeup kind of blush this is the essence
10:20silky touch blush in the shade baby doll i got this for like two dollars at ulta
10:26it's a stunning pink it looks like a regular pink in the pan
10:29but it does have a sheen to it i'm going to use the more feet and 5 56 brush this
10:35brush is about ten . nine ninety nine and I technology and i'm just going to
10:41pop this on my cheeks
10:43now i do recommend going a little bit overboard not okay not overboard by
10:51adding a little bit more blush then you usually would because that is the first
10:55thing to go on your skin
10:57so you always want to apply a little bit more than you normally would because it
11:01is going to fade
11:01anyway so just remember that I'm just popping it right here to the apples
11:07swirling it around and then bring it back to blend everything
11:18ok so because my face is really really mad right now and I like glow I mean I
11:23do have a little bit of love my cheeks but I like a nice glow
11:27I'm first going to going with the wet and wild color icon bronzer
11:31this is not a bronze are clearly this is a blush
11:35I mean he highlight and this is in the shade reserve your cabana this is the
11:39most subtle highlight ever like the most subtle highlight in my collection
11:43when it comes to the drugstore but it gives your cheeks like a glow from
11:47within so i highly recommend this for those of you who have large pores who
11:51have like textured rough textured skin because this is not going to emphasize
11:56your skin
11:56what so ever going to give you a very subtle glow so if you like a band
12:00highlight that don't go for this but it's not going to emphasize your skin
12:03which is what i really really like about this i'm going to take the elf
12:08no this is not off the siding brush by Real Techniques and i'm going to lightly
12:14start highlighting
12:18this is a stunning highlight four Brides because it is so natural especially for
12:25those of you with oily skin because it's not going to be too much you're not
12:30going to look really you're just gonna look like you are naturally glowy
12:34can you see it it's very subtle so I'm going to take this on the bridge of my
12:38nose
12:39so the first thing I'm gonna do is prime my eyelids you want to make sure that
12:46you are priming your lids especially on your wedding day because you want your
12:50eye makeup to stay in place the entire day this is the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow
12:54primer so the eyeshadows i'm going to be working with come from two products
13:01the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and the wet and wild walking on
13:07eggshells little trio
13:09I'm going to take this eyeshadow brush from ELF this is from there one dollar
13:13line and I'm going to dip it into this color right here it's a nice pink
13:16champagne and i'm just going to apply this to my entire lid
13:32i'm also going to take that same brush with that same eyeshadow and i'm going
13:36to apply this to my inner corner
13:42i'm also going to take this color here labeled brow bone and it's a white with
13:48a little bit of gold chain
13:49so I'm going to go right on top of this just to make it even brighter and I look
13:54scary right here but it all ties together
13:57now i'm going to take this Real Techniques domed shadow brush and I'm
14:02going to dip it into this color right here labeled crease
14:06it's a really pretty of warm brown it has a little bit of a sheen to it
14:11nothing too crazy i will be putting this into the crease and even though it has
14:14shimmer it doesn't look bad but first I'm just going to start packing it right
14:18here on the outer corners just a little bit and then i'm going to start dragging
14:25it up into the crease
14:28yeah
14:43now i'm going to take the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matter how I taking this a
14:47regular eyeshadow brushes and go ahead and use the same alpha brush
14:51this one is from Coastal Scents the only a few dollars and i'm going to take this
14:54brown right here right in the middle it's a nice neutral ground up to warm up
15:00the pool and i'm just going to put this on the outer corners of my eyes a little
15:04bit just to deepen them up a bit not too much then I'm just going to drag a
15:09little bit into my crease here for my problem highlights I don't want anything
15:17too stark too shimmery too bold
15:21so I'm going to just take the same highlight i use on my face this wet and
15:24wild reserve your cabana
15:25this is a neckl tools eyeshadow brush and I'm just going to apply this to my
15:32brow bone
15:33this is just going to lift the brow a little bit
15:36ok so at this point you can do a winged eyeliner look or whatever if you really
15:45want to i'm not going to do that I want to do something a little bit softer so
15:49I'm gonna take the Sonia Kashuk palette and I'm going to use this matte black
15:53shade right here and we're going to use it as an eyeliner and using a an
15:57eyeshadow as an eyeliner is just going to make it a little bit softer and not
16:00as harsh so I'm taking that same brush i just used to highlight my brow bone and
16:04flipping it over cuz it's a double-ended one and i'm going to use this little
16:08angled one
16:17for my lower lashes i'm just going to take this equal tools brush right here
16:21this is called the flat eyeliner brush and I'm just gonna do it right into this
16:25brown that we put in our crease and put that right
16:31really really close to the water line
16:38but to add a little bit more definition i'm going to take the brown that we used
16:42on the outer corners of our eyes in this palette
16:44this one here this one in the middle and i'm just going to add some to the outer
16:49corners now typically on a day-to-day basis i would just add black or brown
16:57eyeliner but i'm going to add a nude eyeliner this is the Rimmel wake me up
17:02know what like me up for the cover the rear most can analyze coachella
17:06waterproof eyeliner in the shade new applying this to my waterline because
17:11this is really going to bring it up the eyes make them look bigger instead of
17:14using a black which would make them look smaller so applying a nude eyeliner is a
17:19nice little trick
17:20so I will be applying falsies don't feel like you have to if you have nice
17:24luscious long lashes go ahead and apply some mascara
17:28I'm gonna a pile on the telescopic carbon black mascara from l'oreal before
17:34i go in with falsies
17:36ok so these are the finished eyes right here

17:50they are from our dell and they are the dummies

1:12skin by neutrogena and i'm applying this with a makeup geek flat top brush
1:18I really really love this donation and I don't wear it if I don't know why

1:25really beautiful
1:26I'm mixing two products for my under eyes today this is the Maybelline master
1:31conceal and I forgot how good this was

1:46going to take the mac program prime little pen in the shade light boost and
1:51i'm going to highlight with this product
1:53yeah
2:00I just went ahead and blend it in with the same brush
2:07so I decided to do something different i am setting my under eye concealer using
2:12the wet n wild color icon highlight in reserve your curb at cabana reserve your
2:17cabana
2:18it's a very subtle highlight so i use it underneath my eyes to really really
2:21really bright in that area for bronzer i'm using the Real Techniques multitask
2:26brush and dipping it into the too faced chocolate soleil and I tasted a little
2:32bit when I was applying it as you saw this is the milk chocolate silly not the
2:36original this one is much lighter i love this one for my skin when I'm a little
2:41more fair that i decided to add just a little bit of a pinky warmth penis with
2:50the bombs bomb desert I only applied very little bit to my cheeks to
2:54highlight my face i'm using the elf sunkist bronzer in the shade sun kissed
2:58it's not a bronzer but it is a very very golden highlights
3:02it's a very strong gold but it's such a beautiful highlight and it is two bucks
3:06at your local target or wherever they sell elf
3:09I love this highlight it is so golden
3:13I love it so now i'm going to go ahead and do my eye makeup
3:18I am taking the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade glow
3:21i'm applying that underneath my brow bone yes
3:24and to my inner corners then I'm going to take this shape right here called
3:29Cornelius and i'm applying this into my crease with a kat von d brush
3:34I'm only applying very little for now and then I'm gonna take this
3:37josie maran water color eyeshadow it's the beautiful gold 1i have a list of
3:42every like everything down below this is that green one that is a gold
3:47this is the green one ok yes and I just mix that in with my finger and then I
3:52took color pops eyeshadow in the shade
3:54blaze and I applied it right on top with my finger this eyeshadow is definitely
3:58blessed best applied with your finger
4:00so just padded that in that I'm taking a Bobby round single eyeshadow in the
4:05shade camel it's such a deliciously beautiful like yellow yellow brown and
4:10applying this into my crease with a little fluffy crease brush then I'm
4:18going to take a dark brown eyeshadow this one's just from a jouer but you can
4:22use any dark eyeshadow you want and I am just putting this into my crease so that
4:27everything blends nicely and there are no harsh lines
4:31I'm going back into blaze and just apply another layer to my lid just in case any
4:36of it was blended away
4:38I want to add just a little bit of a golden this to my inner corners so i'm
4:41just applying the elf highlight right on top of the glow eyeshadow
4:45then I'm going to take the colour-pop Cornelius shade again
4:49and on a pencil brush i'm just applying this underneath my eyes then going in
4:56with this NYX eyeshadow
4:58it's one of their prismatic eyeshadows this is like the emerald green one and i
5:02just love the contrast of the bronze on the lid and the emerald green on the
5:06lower lash line I think it looks really pretty
5:09so I just smoke that out with that eye shadow and then I applied my mascara so
5:14to finish off this look I'm going to do my lips
5:18this is the charlotte tilbury pillow talk lip liner and then i'm going to
5:21apply the colour-pop lippie stick in the shade pollywog right on top

5:30thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
5:33and I will see you in my next video bye
0:14hey guys so today's video is a makeup
0:17tutorial on this look right here this is
0:20the look I was wearing in my morphe
0:21palette swatches video that i posted on
0:23monday
0:24it's just a little bit more intense i
0:25added a little bit more black eyeshadow
0:27than I did that day and I added a little
0:29bit of a gloss on top as well but more
0:31or less that's pretty much the exact
0:33same look i will link this palette down
0:35below in case you're interested i also
0:37have a ten percent off code with morphy
0:39in case you're interested
0:40it's just kathleenlights safety ten
0:42percent but yes i will exist below this
0:45is my personal favorite look to do with
0:47this palette because it's so smoky and i
0:49love it for going out at night clubbing
0:51a romantic dinner i love how super smoky
0:54eyes pair with a really really nude lip
0:57but if you're not into that super nude
0:58lip i know a lot of people aren't just
1:00pop on whatever color you want and I
1:03know I say about time that this look is
1:04actually super easy because there's no
1:07winged eyeliner or any false lashes of
1:09course you can add a wing you can add
1:11some false lashes make it even more
1:13dramatic but I feel like they look smoky
1:15and dramatic enough to where it doesn't
1:16need eyeliner or false lashes so if
1:19you're someone who just doesn't mess
1:20with the falsies or the eyeliner this
1:22look is definitely for you and yeah I
1:24guess that's only have to say you want
1:26to get this look then just keep watch
1:30ok so i have already primed my eyelids
1:33and i'm going in with my milani shadow
1:35lies in black ink by the way I'm getting
1:39a cold so my voice is very Gracie right
1:41now but i'm just using this as a base
1:44underneath my eye shadows it's just like
1:46a black chubby crayon i'm going to take
1:48this light orangie peachy color in my
1:51crease from the palette and this is
1:54going to be the transition shade i'm
1:56really gonna pack this color into my
1:57crease because i want the crease to be
1:59very very warm and then i'm going to go
2:01in with this bronze shade right here and
2:03I'm just going to take a flat shading
2:05brush and apply this to my entire lid
2:08right on top of that black color
2:11now I'm going to take that peachy color
2:15again and I'm just building some more of
2:17this color into the crease and then I'm
2:20gonna go back into the palette and I'm
2:21going to use this gray cool tone brown
2:24color and i'm going to use this to kind
2:26of blend those two eyeshadows together
2:28the bronze and the orange this is gonna
2:30be like a sandwich in shade just using
2:33this to blend out the edges making sure
2:35there are no harsh lines and then I'm
2:37going to take this light matte color in
2:39the palette and I'm going to use this as
2:40my brow bone highlight i'm going to add
2:43another color on top of it but just for
2:45now that's the brow bone highlight
2:46excuse so I'm gonna take the black in
2:50the palette and I'm just packing this
2:51color on the outer corners of my eyes
2:53and slightly dragging this into the
2:56crease I want to make the look nice and
2:58smoky i'm just applying that black
3:00little by little and then I applied some
3:03more of that bronze color on the inner
3:04part of my eye to intensify the shade a
3:07bit i'm going back into that cool tone
3:12grey brown color and I'm just blending
3:14some of that into the greats
3:16I'm going back in with the bronze chain
3:18you know just layering so I'm going to
3:20start with my face makeup before i
3:21finish up the eyes and i'm taking my NYX
3:24angel primer as my primary to smooth the
3:27skin and then i went over it with the
3:29maybelline fit me Matt and poreless
3:31foundation and i'm just applying that by

4:34waterline as well and then I'm gonna
4:37take a smaller little pencil brush and

4:41and i'm going to focus that really
4:43really close to my waterline I'm sorry
4:45that these parts of the video are a
4:46little bit blurry

1:37lid is this one right here and this is called weenie which we need is what I

1:51this makeup tutorial it's like a rose gold halo with a little bit of warmth I
1:55really hope you enjoyed and once you have to get this list then just keep
1:58watching
1:59so as always i'm priming my eyes with Max prep and prime 24 hour extended I
2:03base this primer is amazing with color pop shadows because it really helps them
2:07stick to your lids
2:09I love this primer and then I'm going to take translucent powder and just dust
2:13that over my lid so that everything blends smoothly
2:17so I'm going to take makeup geeks eye shadow in the shape creme brulee and
2:21this is a stew for a pro blending crease brush and I'm just dusting this into my
2:25crease as my transition shade then I'm going to take mirage also by makeup geek
2:30and i'm going to use this as my brow bone highlight
2:33it's kind of like a mix between a mat and machine it's a really pretty eye
2:38shadow
2:38now i'm going to take Porter from the quad and i love this i should look at
2:44this border i love it so much and i'm going to start by applying this with my
2:48finger and I'm just putting this on my entire lid and then I decided to switch
2:57over to a synthetic brush synthetic brushes work best with color pop I
3:00shadows as opposed to like natural hair brushes so i'm just applying this all
3:04over my lid bringing it up to the crease and make making sure that everything is
3:08nice and blended
3:15and then I'm just going to go back into the eye shadow and making it more
3:19pigmented on the lid and then I got out of the frame you know as usual
3:23so I'm going to take makeup geeks eyeshadow in the shade cocoa bear and
3:27this is another brush pipe here it looks like a mac 217 only it's like a
3:31synthetic version which is perfect to blend out colour-pop eyeshadows and i'm
3:36just applying cocoa butter into my crease and blending it all out
3:40now i'm going to take weenie my favorite shade and with my finger i'm going to
3:44apply this to the center of my eyeball kind of like where my pupil is if you
3:50know what I'm saying
3:51i'm just applying that to my lid and then blending it out with like my own
3:54finger and then i'm going to go back into the shade porter and i'm going to
4:00apply this to the outer corners and the inner corner
4:03I'm trying to create like a halo I effect I only want we need to stand out
4:07like right in the center of the lid so i'm going to move onto my face before I
4:14finish up my eyes I'm going to prime my face with the nivea postmen shave balm
4:18and i'm going to apply that to my entire face and then I'm going to take my
4:22makeup forever ultra HD foundation in the shade 140 and i'm just going to like
4:26him through this because you've seen me put on my foundation about six trillion
4:30times so I'm just applying that with a flat top kabuki by morphy and just you
4:35know
4:36blending then and has used as a huge
4:39now i'm gonna take my bare minerals concealer i think this is called like
4:44the serum concealer
4:45not exactly sure i will have the name down below and i'm just applying this
4:49underneath my eyes and other plates plates now other places of my face to
4:54highlight and then blending that all in with my sedona lace 217 brush
5:03yeah
5:09and to set all that because as you can see that concealer leaves your face like
5:12kind of Dewey
5:13so I'm going to take my it cosmetics bye bye pores press powder and i'm going to
5:18apply that underneath my eyes just to set the concealer to help it from not
5:22creasing and to take away like that
5:24ultra doing this and then I'm just going to apply this everywhere else I put that
5:27concealer
5:28ok so let's finish the eyes
5:32I'm gonna take Porter again on a pencil brush this is a pencil brush from morphe
5:36and it's a synthetic pencil brush which is perfect
5:39you know like I've been saying so i'm applying that to my lower lash line from
5:43the outer corner all the way into the inner corner and then i'm going to apply
5:46black eyeliner this is from nicks it's their job black eyeliner and i'm going
5:51to tight line with this and apply this to my waterline as well and then i'm
5:57also going to take that same black eyeliner and apply it really really
6:00close to my top lashes kind of like about making an eyeliner but i'm not i
6:06just want some definition just not too much and then I'm going to take my
6:09pencil brush and blend that all out so there are no harsh lines
6:20now i'm going to take makeup geeks cocoa bear and I'm going to blend out my lower
6:23lash line without a little bit just so that it looks exactly like the top part
6:27of my eye
6:29I'm gonna go back into weenie with a pencil brush and I'm going to apply this
6:32directly under where we need is on the top lid and then i'm going to go ahead
6:37and apply some mascara this is the L'Oreal telescopic carbon black and then
6:42to highlight my inner corners i am using the Kiko eyeshadow in the shade 208

1:05blending brush into the shade natural beauty
1:08this is like a really light mabi purpley great color
1:12so it's perfect as a transition shade so that's what i'm using it for
1:16I'm just a buffing this back and forth into my crease so that all the other
1:19eyeshadows that I put down on my lid blend nicely into the crease at that
1:27then with a more precise blending brushes from soil but it's just like a
1:33mac 217
1:34I'm gonna dip it into the shade best friend this one is a lot more purple
1:38it's basically just like a mid-tone like matte purple color everything in this
1:42palette is matt by the way and so i'm just applying this to the outer V of my
1:46eye and bringing into my crease
1:49I'm going to take this josie maran water color eyeshadow in the shade apply as L
1:53pink and i'm going to apply this to my lid using the little sponge tip
1:58applicator and then I'm going to blend it out with my finger it's like a really
2:01concentrated metallic pigment so I'm just taking my ring finger and just
2:05blending and out then for my favorite part i'm going to take this pigment from
2:12makeup geek in the shade nightlife
2:13it's a beautiful like to see like champagne with like a totally unknown oh
2:20I know it's really gorgeous on the lid and i'm going to apply this all over my
2:25entire lid up to the crease to intensify that pigment a little bit more i'm going
2:33to take mac fix+ and I'm going to spray my brush with it and then dip it back
2:36into the pigment and this is just really really going to intensify the eyeshadow
2:41it's going to make it more metallic and bring out like the topi undertone a lot
2:45more
2:50and then I got out of the frame a little bit but basically i just put it in my on
2:53my entire lid you get the gist
2:56going back into that tartlet palette I'm gonna take a right back into best friend
3:00and i'm going to apply this right into the crease and i'm using a very very
3:04precise like pointy blending brush it's kind of like a pencil brush and I really
3:09want a lot of the purple to be concentrated into the crease so that's
3:13why I'm using a pencil brush
3:14I'm just taking my time going back and forth and yeah after I do that I'm just
3:26going to blend everything out so there are no harsh lines
3:29I'm taking that fluffy blending brush again sigma e40 and I'm going to get
3:33right back into natural beauty and then I'm just gonna buff everything out into
3:37my crease
3:37I wanted some more purple in my crease but I didn't want it to look harsh i'm
3:41not i did into a cut crease or anything I just want everything to look nice and
3:45diffused and blown out then I'm going to take this shape called super mom and
3:52this is gonna be my highlight it's like a very like a light light light peachy
3:57pinky kind of color and it makes a really nice matte highlight under the
4:00brow bone and i'm going to take this milani I text perfection liquid liner in
4:04black and I'm going to start doing my wing
4:07the way that I really like to do it is I apply a super super thin layer as close
4:12to my lashes as possible and then I make it thicker as I go so I just make the
4:17base really really thin and then just start you know making the
4:21it's thicker but then i get out of the frame as per usual and that went to
4:26cross
4:27I'm going to take this dick gel liner in black
4:32the new like tres Jolie ones they're my favorite black eyeliner from the
4:36drugstore as of right now and i love them so i'm just going to tight line
4:40with it and then I'm just going to go ahead off camera and apply my are dealt
4:44with
4:44I'm gonna finish off i'm going to start my face before I finish off my eyes
4:49i'm priming my face using the Makeup Forever HD primer and then i'm going to
4:53go in with the Bourjois healthy mix serum foundation
4:57usually I would go for like a more full coverage foundation especially for prom
5:02but my skin was acting super sensitive and I wanted something that was like
5:07light weight on my face like I wanted my foundation to be a little bit more
5:11lightweight so that's why I'm using my favorite which is the Bourjois healthy
5:15mix serum
5:16I'm in the shade 52 i'm just applying that all over my face using a Real
5:20Techniques buffing brush and then with a real techniques like powder brush I'm
5:25going to go into the Bourjois healthy balance powder and i'm just going to
5:29powder my face a little bit
5:32stay away from my under eye area specifically because i'm going to go in
5:35with concealer next
5:37and i'm using it the Maybelline master concealed by a studio and on a Real
5:42Techniques contour brush i'm applying that underneath my eyes and then I'm
5:46just going to blend it up
5:48somewhere blend it out blend it out yeah I'm just bringing that up
6:00i also put them on the bridge of my nose and other parts of my face
6:04highlight with the concealer I'm gonna be setting that with mac emphasized
6:09powder
6:10this is a really nice brightening powder and it's good to set your under eyes if
6:14you want like a bright under eye effect which I do especially for night time
6:18we're going out i love the under eye to be nice and bright
6:26yeah
6:30now i'm going to go ahead and finish off the eyes i'm taking a sigma pencil brush
6:34and I'm going to dip it into natural beauty and i'm going to start smoking
6:38that on my lower lashes by the way i filmed this tutorial literally at three
6:41o'clock in the morning so that is why my eyes are so red i was dead tired but I
6:49really wanted to get this video for you guys because you know I didn't have a
6:53video on wednesday and i just wanted a video up but anyway I did that same
6:57pencil brush into the shade best friend and I'm smoking it out even more and
7:03after that i'm going to add some of that same eyeliner from nicks to my water
7:07line just to make it nice and deep on the lower lash line then I'm gonna take
7:11the super dark purple in this palette it's called bombshell and i'm going to
7:15really smoke it out again with the same pencil brush and then i just applied the
7:22mascara and then I am done with the eyes
7:26so moving up to the face I am taking my girl lactic bronzer in the shape Cabo
7:30this is my favorite bronzer of all time and i'm using the Real Techniques multi
7:34tasking brush to just a bronze up my face for some reason my bronzer was kind
7:39of washed out on camera but like I had like an intense bronzing contraction you
7:44just couldn't really tell that much
7:46yes so I'm just contouring kind of and bronzing at the same time for blush I'm
7:52using this tart one called celebrated its like one of their new blushes and it
7:57is beautiful i love it it's a very very soft pink I'm not crazy for blush like
8:01in an intense blush look
8:03so this soft pink is so perfect with so many looks and then i'm going to
8:07highlight my face using the physicians formula i could open it up there you go
8:12shimmer strip in Miami strip my favorite highlighter of all time drugstore
8:17high-end it's my favorite
8:19and I'm just highlighting with I believe this is the waiver like paper
8:23highlighter brush and the brush I use to apply my blush with a mac one like the
8:27mac blush brush but yeah
8:31then i'm going to go ahead and finish off this look by doing a little lip
8:35combo here and my little lip liner broke a little bit
8:39this is a eight colour-pop lippie pencil in the shade skimpy and i'm just
8:44applying that to my entire lip but then i thought it was way too warm for this
8:48look so i'm going in with this next high voltage lipstick in the shade stone
8:53it's such a cool unique like beautiful nude they have a lot of gray to it
8:58I don't know it's really really pretty but yeah
9:01that completes this makeup look thank you guys so much for watching I really
9:04hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my
9:09next video bye
0:06hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the makeup I'm
0:10wearing this is using the anastacio shadow couture palette
0:14this is what it looks like I of course kept it to the very warm eyeshadows in
0:21this palette I really really loved this look actually did a good day when I was
0:26just getting ready and I post them on snapchat like why I really like how it
0:29turned out I should have filmed this tutorial and it got super requested
0:33after that i posted a picture of me wearing it on Instagram and pretty much
0:37everyone commented
0:39please do a tutorial on this look so that is what i'm doing right now
0:42I love it when I saw cells pallets like this because you get a ton of eyeshadows
0:48and they're like $35 I think so it's really good it's a lot of bang for your
0:53buck and the quality of the eyeshadows are really nice
0:56I really really love this palette it's probably my favorite one so far just
1:00because I just love these warm colors but then you have pops of color down
1:06here as well it is a little bit different than the look I posted on
1:09Instagram I made it just a little darker a little bit more Brown in my crease and
1:15stuff like that I just made a little bit more dramatic but i really love this
1:19look I wasn't going to post it because I do so many like chocolate looks but it
1:23was requested
1:25just keep that in mind if you comment like you do it looks like this all the
1:28time it was requested okay so yeah if you want to see how to get this look at
1:33this
1:33angels game while watching I primer of choice today is the mac 24 hour extended
1:38I base I just recently discovered this and it's probably one of the best
1:42eyeshadow primer is i have ever used going into the Anasazi palette i am
1:46taking soft peach and I'm packing this all over my entire lid just to set that
1:51I base we just put down now I'm going to take a fluffy crease brush this is from
1:56sephora i'm going to dip my brush into the shade morocco and I am packing this
2:00in my crease this is kind of like my transition shade and i'm putting this
2:04everywhere pretty much just slowly dipping the color dipping the brush back
2:08into the color and just intensifying it going back and forth until I wanted
2:13exactly how I want it
2:15yeah does it make sense taking another brush I'm going into the color fudge
2:19it's the chocolatey color in the palette and I'm putting this all over my entire
2:23lid bringing it right up to the crease
2:31now i'm gonna take this one I'm pretty sure it's called Bellini it's a really
2:34pretty peach
2:36this is just like a random eyeshadow brush from urban decay that i got in the
2:40electric palette but i like it to pack on eyeshadow so I'm putting this all
2:43over the lid on top of that fudge color then applying fix+ to the brush and I'm
2:49just intensifying that color even more because adding of the fixed plus really
2:54makes this eyeshadow like a peachy metallic finish so i wanted to add the
2:58fixed plus to intensify it then I'm going to take a brush really similar to
3:02the mac 217 it's like a tapered crease brush and I'm a taking I'm not taking
3:06the fudge color and i'm putting this directly into my crease
3:10I don't want it as sloppily as the Morocco shade
3:13I want to make sure that that Braun stays focused in the outer V of my eye
3:17and in my crease as well so I'm just slowly building that color going back in
3:23to Morocco I'm just blending everything out so that the lines aren't too too
3:27harsh
3:28I'm not just going to take a white eyeshadow to highlight my brow bone
3:32since there isn't an eyeshadow light enough
3:34in the Anasazi palette this is just a white eyeshadow from a little rock
3:38palette
3:38we use any eyeshadow you want i dip my brush into the shade noir just to apply
3:43it really close to my lashes so that it can look like I have some eyeliner I'm
3:48just smudging it there just for the you know effect of eyeliner so i'm going to
3:53move onto my face before I finish my eyes I'm taking this tiny little sample
3:56i got for a mac it is there strobe cream
3:59it came when like ordered something the other day and I
4:02loved it like I love this as a primer it just makes my face so do it i love it
4:07now i'm going to take my makeup forever ultra HD foundation and i'm applying
4:11this on my entire face using a Marc Jacobs brush you don't need this brush
4:16honestly it was way too expensive but I wasn't the one who bought it was a
4:20present but it's really amazing but I don't recommend it
4:25just because it's so so pricey there's tons of brushes that do the same thing
4:30so i'm just applying it because you know it was a gift from Danny
4:34huh so I'm just using it anyway yeah so I applied the ultra HD foundation all
4:39over my face I mean why 335 it's like more of my Tanner shade but we're making
4:44it work so i'm using the Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser
4:49this is in the shade affair and i'm using this underneath my eyes to cover
4:53up some dark circles and to highlight my face but to further highlight I'm taking
4:57the Mac prep and prime pen in
5:00yep wipe that off your nose and i'm using what is called but it's got like
5:05boost
5:05it's the yellow one and i'm using this to highlight on the rest of my face and
5:09I added a little bit more to the under eye area just to further bryson and then
5:13I'm just blending that in but i'm not using us a doorman lace brush surprised
5:18i know but my son always brush was really really dirty so i just use this
5:22one for more feet
5:23it's not as good but it got the job done you know so yes just I just blended that
5:29and you've seen me blend in my concealer about a million times but yes
5:34all right
5:37i'm setting my under eye concealer using this NYX HD powder in the shade banana
5:41it's like the yellow powder i love it I've been using it a lot and I really
5:44love it
5:45so I'm using an elf tapered brush to just blush
5:49- elf tapered brush to set my concealer i'm setting everywhere I put that
5:54concealer
5:57alright so let's finish these eyes
6:01I'm taking this flat sort of brush by Sigma and I'm taking fudge and i'm
6:07applying it really close to my lower lashes and then I'm going to take more
6:12and do the same thing but on the outer corners I'm not dragging it all the way
6:16in like I did with fudge and then I'm just going to take morocco and blend
6:20everything out with a pencil brush to smudge it real good make sure everything
6:23is nice and blended and a smoky
6:26so now for mascara I'm using my L'Oreal telescopic and I was like whoa did I
6:31break it but no it was just a packaging malfunction
6:34this is the telescopic carbon black and I'm just coding my top and bottom lashes
6:38with this you can do falsies but I just decided to skip it then I'm going to
6:42take this pencil brush and i applied mac fix+ to it and I'm gonna dip this brush
6:47into the pink champagne color adding fix plus it's up to this eyeshadow
6:51intensifies it by like a million it makes it super foil and metallic so i'm
6:56applying this to my inner corners to create a nice metallic pinky inner
7:01corner
7:01so this is the laura geller baked bronzer in medium and it looks so dark I
7:06was really scared the first time I used it but i'm using this real techniques
7:10multitask brush and if I focus my brush on the more whitish part of the bronzer
7:14actually really love the bronzer
7:17it blends really nicely because the baked product but it just looks so nice
7:21so I'm only using a little bit to warm up my skin I'm not trying to contour
7:25anything just adding a little bit of color to my face
7:31all right
7:34for blush I'm using Mac warm soul because it just goes so well with this
7:38eyeshadow look I love this blush it's so beautiful
7:41and yeah that's what I'm applying to my sheiks and when I posted this picture on
7:46Instagram i was using the jaclyn hill champagne pop Becca highlight but i
7:50decided to use something different so i'm just i went with the hard candy
7:54baked bronzer intiki and i'm applying this to mind the tops of my cheekbones
7:59and on my nose just to highlight my face because I love to highlight all right
8:04for lips i'm using this over a liquid lipstick in the shade sao paulo i don't
8:08want to say that now Paolo
8:10it's such a beautiful nude it's like amazing these liquid lipsticks are one
8:14of the best liquid lipsticks i have ever used
8:17seriously stunning i love them i highly recommend them so after that i'm
8:21applying this marc jacobs lip gloss and sugar sugar right on top and then I
8:26wanted my look to be a little bit more doing so i took this
8:29josie maran Nirvana hydrating treatment missed and applied it to my skin this
8:34isn't a setting spray it's more of a treatment but I like how it makes my
8:38makeup look so yes that completes this look
8:41thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
8:43and I'll see you in my next video
0:19hey guys so today's video is another tutorial using the Urban Decay Naked 3
0:25palette
0:26I said that I would do a couple of tutorials using this palette so this is
0:29look numero dos
0:30it's a pretty dark bold smokey eye this is perfect for a night on the town and
0:36this look definitely calls for false lashes like it would look absolutely
0:39beautiful with false lashes but i'm not a false lashes expert guys not i'm not
0:45very good with false lashes
0:47I just I never wear them um I just use like a very thick volumizing mascara and
0:52it does the job I mean I'm just really happy with the way that this turned out
0:57I'm actually really really loving this palette and i don't know if i should say
1:03this yet
1:05I'm not going to okay I'm gonna say it i might like this more than my naked 2
1:09palette
1:11I haven't had it long enough to say that but i'm really loving the undertones in
1:17these eyeshadows so much more than I thought I would
1:20by the way i do not do my entire face in this tutorial you probably can't tell
1:25but I'm like getting the flu i just know i know it's coming and I know that
1:30people are mainly worried about the eyeshadows not what's on the rest of my
1:33face but everything that is on the rest of my face right now will be in the
1:37description box so if you're interested in like lip color or something
1:41just check down there because it'll be okay I'm gonna stop talking about by the
1:45way thumbs up this video if you want to see more naked 3 palette tutorials
1:49the first thing i'm going to do is take my Urban Decay primer potion
1:53because at the base of money
1:55you can kind of slip off if I don't have a primer which is this
1:59this is the NYX jumbo pencil in the color black meat
2:03I'm just gonna line it really close to my lash line and then just blend it up
2:07with my fingers but i'm not going to be taking a pass the crease
2:12now i'm taking this color right here called nooner and i'm going to be
2:14buffing this into my crease I really just want to blend out that black bass
2:19we put down and a lot of the Black is just going to blend always can see it
2:24starts like coming off but I do go back and add some more black to that to the
2:28spots that kind of disappeared
2:33now i'm taking the color limit and i'm just going to add this to my crease as
2:37well and just make everything nice and blended now i'm taking the color dark
2:43side and going to go all over the lid but i'm not really going to take it past
2:48the trees i'm just going to be putting it up to the crease
2:53and right here i'm just cleaning because this kind of has a little bit of fallout
2:57I'm just cleaning up and getting like a nice little sharp edge
3:00now i'm taking the color liar and I'm gonna be bluffing this into my crease
3:03this is just going to blend it really nicely from that dark side color to the
3:07matte shade in the crease
3:09I really like how it looks even though it is a shimmery color and then i'm
3:12taking burnout and i'm going to be doing the exact same thing for some reason I
3:16just think that these colors look really pretty together and like I don't know
3:19it's a good nice little transition then i'm taking my master drama eyeliner and
3:24midnight master and I'm going to line my waterline and then for my Bravo
3:28highlight i am just taking the color strange and i'm putting that in my tear
3:31duct as well and then I'm just adding some eyeliner to make that little winged
3:38liner and I do it off camera because they have to get super close to the
3:41mirror and then you just not be able to see me then I'm taking the color liar
3:45and i'm just going to buff this underneath my lower lash line just to
3:48kind of smoke it out and then I'm gonna soften the outer edges of that wing with
3:53that same eyeshadow and then I'm just going to pack on the mascara this
3:58tutorial was super quick and easy anybody could do it even a beginner so i
4:03really hope you enjoyed thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe
4:06if you haven't already and I
4:07see you in my next one
0:20hey guys so today's video and makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right
0:24now I wanted to play around with the new color pop colors for spring like a
0:29really pretty mint ocean turquoise and an insane
0:34blue and honestly this is very similar to look I've done in the past with
0:37different colors
0:38I even did a look very similar to this with color pops weenie and Porter but i
0:44just love this kind of our looks like the halo I where you have like a lighter
0:48shade in the middle it's one of my favorite techniques to use
0:51I do look like this all the time I just switch up the colors so yeah I wanted to
0:55play around with the new color pop colors these are available already and
0:58and ok so i tried the braids
1:01I love this hairstyle i love this since I was a little girl it reminds me so
1:04much of Miss hold up
1:06I've said this before in a video I feel but it reminds me of a little girl who
1:09miss Trent Boult throws over the fence by her braids by her pigtails
1:14even though hers weren't like this in the movie she just had like a regular
1:17break anyway
1:18Nicole Guerriero uploaded a tutorial on how to do this so i tried my best and I
1:23followed a long hair tutorial but I feel like I just suck I cannot do hair
1:27I suck so if you're frustrated because you can't do here with the same you and
1:31I you and I with the same but anyway if you want to see how to get this makeup
1:35tutorial right here
1:37then just keep watching ok so oddly enough i'm starting off with my face
1:41I never do i always start off with my eyes but we'll go with it
1:45this is the skin and Naevia primer spray and I'm just sprang that on my face and
1:50I'm going in with the new foundation this is the josie maran vibrancy argan
1:54oil foundation
1:55this is in the shade cause make and I'm liking it I think it's really nice
2:00sometimes I feel like it sits on top of the skin I need to play with it a little
2:04bit more but it's nice and dewy and
2:06I like it so far it's not my favorite but i really like it so far so far
2:10underneath my eyes I'm using the Catrice waterproof camouflage concealer
2:15i'm applying this underneath my eyes cover up them dark circles and i'm also
2:19applying this to my eyelids to prime for the eyeshadows and i'm just going to be
2:23blending that in with my Beauty Blender
2:36to set all that creaminess down I'm taking my RC may know color powder and
2:41i'm using this is sephora 47 brush to set my under eye concealer and pretty
2:46much set everywhere else
2:47I applied concealer as well i also took this wet and wild stippling brush and
2:54just dusted some of that powder on the rest of my face
2:57i'm going in with a bronzer that i have been loving so much ever since I tried
3:02it
3:02this is the to face sweetheart bronzer in the shade sweet tea
3:07i love it because it has a machinery site and Matt side and when you combine
3:10them you get a beautiful bronze glow
3:12i'm applying this with my way of a 90 brush one of the best bronzer brushes in
3:17my opinion
3:18love it so now i'm going to go ahead and start on my eyes I'm using the makeup
3:22eyeshadow and beaches and cream and i'm applying this into my crease with the
3:26morphe e23 brush and then i'm going in with makeup geek creme brulee and i'm
3:32also applying this into the crease but a little bit more precisely in the crease
3:35and i'm using the morphe m4 for one brush to apply that just going back and
3:40forth and i'm going in with this stunning amazing colour by colour pop
3:45this is one of their new super shock shadows for spring
3:49it's in the shade luckily and i'm applying this now with the marc jacobs
3:54brush but honestly this is the kind of eye shadow that applies the best with
3:57your fingers and you'll see here in a second but first I am taking make a peek
4:02bedrock and i'm just using this eyeshadow to kind of blend out the edges
4:05of that blue and i'm going to take anastacio Beverly Hills eyeshadow in the
4:10shade farm with the same brush I'm using an e 28 by morphy and I'm just blending
4:15this into the crease so you get a nice gradient from the blue
4:19- like the warm brown here's what i'm talking about this eyeshadow looks
4:23stunning once you start applying it with your fingers
4:25I find that some color pop shadows do look great with a synthetic brush but
4:30this shape specifically apply with your fingers
4:32I'm taking this Luxy 229 brush remember dipping it into luckily and then buffing
4:38this into the crease
4:39this is just going to make everything blend better I went back into fond and
4:43blended that some more but just go back and forth with these two shades and make
4:47sure there are no harsh lines huh
4:50excuse me I went back into creme brulee by makeup geek and just dusted that into
4:54my crease and now i'm going to take this beautiful color pop shadow in the shade
4:58of a flower shop and with my finger I am just applying this right to the center

6:15or highlight and literally just bronze up my face a lot with this product so

6:24this entire video

6:45you liked it please subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you in my
6:48next video bye
0:26hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on me make up i'm wearing right
0:31now this is the look I was wearing in my favorite makeup brushes video and it was
0:35highly requested it looks a little darker today for some reason i guess
0:39because my tee shirt is black and I was wearing very light colors that day
0:44somewhere then it looks a little darker but it's literally the exact same look I
0:48was wearing in that video
0:50so if you want to see a tutorial on the look I was going in the video then the
0:53routines
0:54i am using a bunch of random different eye shadows for this look but you can
0:57use whatever similar eyeshadows you have at home and it'll probably turn out
1:00pretty much the same so really quickly i want to mention because i know people
1:03are going to tell me i know this look is it like a daytime smokey eye this
1:07no this isn't for everybody this is probably way too much eye makeup for a
1:12lot of people and like I said on camera for some reason it looks a lot darker
1:16than what it looks like in person but it's not that serious guys it's just
1:20makeup and sometimes it's fun to be a little bold and edgy like right now all
1:24I'm missing is my guitar and got the look going on
1:28so anyway I just wanted to say that yeah it's not for everybody but some people
1:31like this look so I try to do different things for different people
1:35so if you want to see how to get this look just so the first thing I'm going
1:40to do is a prime my eyelids with Lorax behind the scenes eye primer and I'm
1:45going to take that all the way up to my brow bone then I'm going to take the
1:48color tattoo in pomegranate punk and it's this really pretty like cranberry
1:52purple and i'm going to apply this really close to my lash line
1:56I'm not even gonna put this like on my entire litter anything
2:01next I'm taking cork by mack on the fluffy blending brush and I'm just going
2:06to be applying this into my crease as my transition color
2:09I'm really not being specific with this I'm just leaven that all over my crease
2:13and i'm going to take a flat shader brush with this eyeshadow called
2:17Galapagos it's from NARS you can use any brown you want and i'm going to apply
2:21this to my entire bit
2:30by the way this look is going to look a little messy before it looks good it's
2:35one of those looks that you really have to blend a lot and then it turns out
2:39nice in the end
2:40now i'm just taking some of that cork I used earlier and i'm going to apply this
2:46into my crease with my - 17 and I'm just trying to blend these colors out a
2:50little bit more but we will go back to that and do some more blend and later on
2:54now i'm taking maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master it's just a
2:59nice dark black and I'm going to tight line with this and i'm also going to
3:02apply this to my waterline now with my mac 217 I'm gonna take this color called
3:09co-star it's from a two faced natural at night palette but honestly any dark warm
3:15chocolate color will work for this
3:18this was just my favorite so I'm applying that into my crease with my -
3:2217 and start blending away like i said this look requires lots and lots of
3:27blending
3:30yeah
3:34now i'm taking my gel eyeliner and i'm going to start smudging that on my upper
3:40lash line you don't want to be precise with this at all since we are going to
3:42be like smudging it away pretty much
3:45so you can be sloppy
3:49now with the tiny little brush I'm going to dip it into some black eyeshadow and
3:53then i'm going to use that to help smudge the gel eyeliner and i'm going to
3:58go back in with Galapagos and then i'm going to apply it on top just so that
4:02the black and blend into the brown a little bit more
4:08it's kind of like an ombre I don't want it to be like a black line and then
4:11Brown
4:12I wanted to fate now i'm going back into court and on my fluffy blending brush
4:16I'm going to start
4:18you guessed it blending
4:24at this point you just really really want to take your time and blend it and
4:28buff it this is the part that takes the longest just making sure that it looks
4:31kind of like it fades up and it's like a gradient from dark to a light brown
4:37now i'm just going to apply my mascara to my top lashes and then finish the
4:42rest of my face so that i can finish the bottom part of my eyes as my primary i'm
4:48using the Maybelline Baby skin instant poori racer
4:52when you have such dark colors on your eyes you want to make sure that you're
4:57using a full coverage foundation
4:59just like an look like it's a flawless and there's not a lot of redness because
5:03then it'll look like grungy and weird so i am using the Maybelline know the
5:08revlon colorstay with foundation and i am using this on a real techniques
5:16expert face brush to buff it all out
5:22yeah
5:26rendering my eyes I want something that's also a full coverage since the
5:30eyes are so dark and i'm using max pro longwear concealer everything that i'm
5:34using will be in the description box by the way if you are interested in what
5:38shade or whatever that will be down below
5:52and then I'm just going to set that with my msf natural
5:55I need one a little bit lighter I need to buy one but yeah now i'm going to
5:59take cork again and I'm going to use this on a pencil brush to smudge it
6:04underneath my eyes and then apply my mascara
6:06so for the rest of my face the bronzer i'm going to be using is NARS Laguna and
6:11I'm just gonna just pretty much bronze my whole face i'm not going to be too
6:14precise with this i'm not going to do like a strong contour anything
6:21yeah
6:26yeah
6:47for my blush I'm using Mac's margin and it's a really nice like pinky peach
6:52color I'm using this on the duo fiber brush because it doesn't deposit that
6:55much blush so I don't want something really strong i just want something to
7:00look like nice and pitching
7:02nice
7:09and then for my lips i am using Maybelline's blushing beige lipstick and
7:18then that's it that completes this look for you guys i really hope you enjoyed

3:44I'm still testing it out I don't know how I feel about it I definitely like
3:48the post shave balm a lot more so for my foundation i'm mixing together the

6:15am applying my lip color i'm taking the colour-pop lippie pencil in the shade
6:19tauros tauros tauros tauros and then i'm filling in my lips with it and then i'm

6:31i really hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching please
6:34subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video
6:37toodles
0:10ok so i felt a tutorial for the look i'm wearing right now
0:16it is like a bronzy but like a pinky bronzy look um I always do wings liner
0:24all the time either with gel or with liquid liner I just I've always done
0:28that but I did something a little bit different in this tutorial that haven't
0:33done in a while and i just i love how it turned out and I hope you guys do - okay
0:40so if you want to see how to get this look then please keep watching
0:44ok so I've already done my eyebrows and I heard this I eyebrows have not been
0:51cooperating with me lately
0:52so don't look at them ok so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
0:56take my Urban Decay primer potion this is just a little baby in the old
0:59packaging about this forever last pretty long time i would say and i'm just going
1:06to put this all over my lid
1:08all the way to the bone and then kind of run it on my lower lashes a little
1:14ok so the first of the two only eyeshadows i'm going to be using is
1:21called cork
1:22it's my mac and it's just like a just like a browns a really nice crease color
1:27and I'm taking on this fluffy brush this is a sigma e40 but any like really big
1:33fluffy brush will be fine and i am just going to work that into my crease
1:45I'm going to do it really lightly and just build up the color I'm going to go
1:48back and forth into this color cork and just build it up a little by little but
1:53i'm also going to be putting some of the color on the outer V just like rubbing
1:57it in and then bringing it into the crease
2:00ok so now it's my favorite part is the lid color and what I'm going to be using
2:07is max pigment and tan
2:09I have been obsessed with this I use this and everything and makes it with my
2:14bronzer to give like more glow to my face
2:17sometimes it actually was on my accent nail right here like my nail polish this
2:23color right here is just some of the ten pigment and then I put a clear top coat
2:29on it so I mean this is a multi-purpose little pigment any all the pigments on
2:36but i've been loving loving loving this color
2:40it's amazing so I'm just taking the top I'm like kind of mixing it and using
2:48whatever product is on the top so I'm just going to take my mac 239 brush and
2:55I'm just gonna pack this all over my entire life
3:08I'm going to take the same brush for the like this and kind of bring some into
3:13the crease just a tiny tiny bit like that like a tiny bit so I'm going to
3:20take my fix plus now i am going to spring my brush
3:26why it always freaks me out every time I swear that i'm going to dip it into the
3:31pigment and put this all over my lid again
3:35the fix plus really intensifies the shadow and gives it more like a metallic
3:41look
3:54and this is really just going on the lid I'm not bringing it into the crease at
3:59all
4:03ok so now I'm going to work on the lower lash line a little bit and I'm going to
4:06take the same brush kind of dry it off and i'm going to dip it into the pigment
4:12and I'm only picking up a little bit on the very tip of the brush like I'm not
4:18putting it on the actual brush like this it's just on the very tip I'm picking up
4:22a very small amount and i'm going to run that really close to my waterline
4:37now i'm just going to go back to my fluffy brush and back to that cork
4:41eyeshadow that we use in the crease and I'm going to do the same thing like the
4:47first step i did i'm going to do it all over again
4:49not so much though just going to try to blend this out a little more and bring
4:56some depth to the other be
5:04ok I know it seems like a lot of steps but it's really quickly when you're
5:07doing it on your own it's literally two eyeshadows
5:10it's just that I'm trying to explain it but really if you're doing this on your
5:14own it's your done in a second
5:17now i'm just taking a pencil brush
5:20this is a sigma e30 and I'm gonna dip it back
5:25Oh different right back into this cork color and we're gonna blend out the tan
5:32pigment on the lower lash line
5:40this part takes a little bit of time you just have to sit there and kind of blend
5:45so it looks nice and smoked out
5:54ok so once I've done that I'm just going to line my waterline i am using brown
5:59because i don't want it to be super harsh i don't want to be like very black
6:04I like this to look a little chocolaty and bronzy from any sense
6:09so I'm using the keyless much stick waterproof eyeliner in damsel
6:15this comes in the ELA in the light palette it's like the most beautiful
6:18chocolate brown color and it stays on your waterline all day so I'm just going
6:24to line my waterline with this and then i'm going to tight line as well
6:35ok so now i am going to do this little smoked out eyeliner
6:41so basically I'm just going to be drawing a line right here like if I were
6:44doing a liquid liner or something but pretty sloppy because it doesn't matter
6:52you I'm going to be blending that out in a second
7:06this drives pretty quickly so I've got to work quickly
7:10I'm just going to take this this is an eyebrow brush that I got from coastal
7:15sense but i use it like some gel eyeliner it's amazing for that
7:19so now i'm just gonna smoke this out
7:29just want to go back and forth until it's pretty smoked out and it kind of
7:32blends in with that tan pigment
7:34ok so now that i'm done blending this is what it looks like it's kind of like a
7:38diffused liner and it's a lot more natural than having a gay black liquid
7:44liner or don't line or something like that
7:47ok so now we're going to kind of do the same thing on the lower lash line
7:50only I'm not adding any more eyeliner I'm just gonna kind of smudge what's
7:55already there so I'm just going to start blending this
7:58oh I'm using a pencil brush and stead of this one because this one can be a
8:04little harsh for your under eyes I'm using a pencil brush
8:08I'm getting really close to the water line that time smudging it down kind of
8:18ok so for my brow bone highlight and like my inner corner highlight
8:22I'm just going to take like a cream colored shadow I don't want anything
8:25shimmery since there's so much sugar on the lids
8:28you can if you're doing this look you can go ahead and do something humor if
8:30you want to tweet you don't I just don't like to have something so shimmery under
8:35my brow bone when I have something should be on the lips ok so i'm just
8:39going to take my while Danny pallets color right here
8:42I don't know what it's called they know they sell this color separately when a
8:45while sell it separate e and if you find it i really suggest you get it's like
8:50the best most pigmented cream-colored highlight color
8:56yeah so I'm just going to take this on my pencil brush and put this
9:00underneath my eyebrow and I'm going to take it into my
9:07- your duck as well
9:16and now i'm just going to add my mascara i am using my clinic / doubling mascara
9:22for my top lashes and i'm using my illegal length by Maybelline mascara on
9:29my bottom lashes and i will be right back okay
9:33and this is the finished
9:36I look I personally love it
9:40and now i'm going to move to my face ok so for the face i'm going to keep it
9:45pretty simple not going to do anything crazy at all
9:47i have already primed right face with the team relief powder job and I kind of
9:54touched up some little pimple areas i put some concealer over them and to do
10:00that i use the gabby consider I got in my ofc bag last month
10:04ok so you guys are actually going to witness me using the Beauty Blender for
10:10the very first time
10:11as you can see it's like bright neon kind of hurts your eyes a little bit
10:14because i have never used it before it's been like to know
10:21yeah it's like two weeks since i bought it and i haven't used it yet i don't
10:23know why i guess because I don't want to do it and that's really sweet but i
10:27gotta just wait for the first time right now and like I felt to expand in the
10:32palm of my hand and I thought
10:33it was the coolest thing I don't know that anybody else experience that when
10:37different about this
10:38it's literally like this big and came out this big but it's tiny and then it
10:43just like expands in your hand when you like switching the water out it's so
10:49cool to me oh no you know that's really dorky but I found that really cool
10:54ok so I'm going to see how well this works so this is kind of like my first
10:58impressions on it
10:59in this tutorial so i'm going to be using my L'Oreal True Match Lumi i have
11:04come to the conclusion that this is my holy grail foundation after my black
11:09colors day
11:10they're kind of tied I want this stuff is amazing i love it the more i use this
11:17the more I hate my trouble on your naked foundation but anyway so i guess i'm
11:21just going to bounce this into my foundation put this on my face
11:40yeah
11:44this is fun
11:46for some reason I camera this kind of looks like it's a little too dark for me
11:49but this
11:52I don't know why looks like that on camera doesn't look like that in my
11:57mirror
11:58that's it for me
12:05this is awesome because story
12:13whenever I use like my foundation brush which might like amazing holy grail
12:17foundation brush is the Sigma angled kabuki the f-84 and love that not even
12:26my real techniques expert face brush is as good as that one and i thought it
12:30would be but it isn't but you have to sit there and kind of blend it for a
12:35while this kind of just puts on your foundation perfectly like perfectly
12:50and I feel like it doesn't drink up a lot of the product either like you know
12:54like those little cheap triangle sponges that you get like a target the stuff I
12:59used for my foundation on with that all the time when I was younger and that
13:03like just drank up the liquid and it's crazy that this one doesn't because it's
13:08a sponge
13:09well I guess the when you are dampen it kind of let that happen but ok so this
13:17little guy is amazing and i don't know if you can tell but i feel like when i
13:21use this sponge as opposed to my brush gives me more like a dewy finish this is
13:27a foundation that gives you a new we finish but I feel like with my brush my
13:31stuff it in
13:32I don't get like the dizziness of the foundation I mean not really
13:36not as much as this I don't know if you can see it like my face is glowing over
13:39here
13:40I don't know i love this but the real test
13:44i'm going to put to the test right now is how well it blends out my consider
13:48underneath my eyes cuts
13:52that's what's important to me so pumped a tiny bit of my mac pro longwear
13:58concealer on the back of my hand and I
14:03to pop this and like a triangle shape
14:08ok oh I'm in the shade and w 15 mile away you're wondering
14:12okay let's see
14:28ok so my memory card got full so i had to go take the memory card output in the
14:36computer
14:37that's how I know that this video is probably way too long because my memory
14:41card never gets full before i finish filming it usually gets fully when I'm
14:48done you know
14:49so right
14:52so yeah well i was uploading the footage footage
14:57yeah I guess you were calling footage into my computer i set my under eye
15:01concealer with my msf natural in mediums my favorite place ever
15:09but yeah I think you blend it out amazingly like just like flawlessly like
15:16this
15:16honestly it's flawless its twenty dollars it's crazy but I think that it
15:22just applies your makeup amazing right it doesn't look on my forehead
15:26it doesn't look like a foundation on that's insane
15:30ok so like i said earlier I'm not gonna do anything crazy to my face and my dark
15:35like the Sun comes and goes and
15:38that's what sets of our natural lighting just like whatever mother nature wants
15:42to piss you off at will
15:45so I'm gonna take my contouring blush and bronzing powder i have been loving
15:49this
15:50I'm recently I like it a lot more for the summer because i know this is a
15:55pretty deep

1:47this look is using my morphe 35o palette
1:51this was also so requested a lot of you guys were like why haven't you both
1:55Cesaro using that and it's just because it's so constantly out of stock i don't
1:58like to upset anyone
1:59but i did use that palette for this look today
2:03it's a very messy brown smokey eye so anyone can do this look absolutely
2:08anyone it's just really just a messy brown smokey eye
2:12nothing too fancy or too complicated so i feel like i've been talking for like
2:1610 minutes already
2:17if you want to see how to get this makeup look right here then just keep
2:21watching
2:22ok so I am jumping into eyeshadow since my eyes are already primed
2:27I'm taking this really light warm shade in the palette I hate that none of these
2:32have names but I mean the entire palette is warm and full of orange colors but
2:37i'm just taking a light shade in the palette and using this in my crease
2:42now i'm taking this dark matte Brown this brown has a lot of red to it so
2:47it's like a very reddish brown and i'm applying this on my entire lid
2:56yeah
2:57I'm going to go into this mid tone brown shade and on a small little crease brush
3:02I am just applying that into my crease just so that I can blend those brown
3:07colors together
3:10now i'm going to take a darker brown
3:14this one isn't as red as the 1i used before and it's a little bit deeper
3:18so on a flat shader brush I am just applying this to my entire lid just to
3:22deepen up the look i wanted something a little bit darker now I'm going to take
3:27this orange color and on that same little crease brush we used earlier i am
3:32applying this into my crease to really really warm up the look i wanted the
3:37crease to look like very orangie so that as well as it and then I just took a big
3:43fluffy brush just to blend out any harsh edges
3:47I took this shimmery like light champagne pinky shade and i applied this
3:54underneath my brow bone to highlight now i'm taking a black eyeliner this one is
4:00from nicks it's their specially like saying that or attempting to say that
4:07and I tight line with this and then I applied it really close to my lashes and
4:12smudged it out with a pencil brush you can use winged eyeliner but i wanted
4:16something a little bit more messy and smudge looking and then I just went
4:20right back into that deep matte brown shade and applied applied it to my lid
4:25all over again
4:28okay i'm going to take this like neon peach shade and i'm going to lightly
4:34dust this into my crease and this is really going to make it look
4:39go from zero to a hundred in terms of warmth it's really gonna warm things up
4:43so i'm going to move on to the rest of my face before I finish up my eyes as I
4:47usually do and i'm using the Maybelline Baby skin
4:51Oh taking a sip of my sparkling water but I use my baby skin and support your
4:57acer as a primer and then i'm using the Makeup Forever HD stick foundation i'm
5:02going to give you guys a quick little review because you guys wanted to know
5:05my thoughts on this
5:06I love this it's amazing this is like the first stick foundation that actually
5:11works for dry skin believe it or not because it does have like a very sat in
5:15natural finish a lot of people say it's like a dewy finish but I find it a
5:19little bit more at least on my dry skin
5:21it's not as doing it's a little bit more like natural and this color is a shade
5:26too dark for me I've gotten very fair / you know the past few weeks but it is a
5:33little bit too dark for me but let's try to look past it i'm going to take my
5:39Maybelline fit me concealer in 15 fair and i'm applying this underneath my eyes
5:44not only to hide my dark circles but to highlight my face and I'm also
5:49highlighting other parts of my face as well
5:54i'm blending all that in with my Real Techniques contour brush
6:09and of course to make sure that my concealer does increase
6:12I'm setting it with my NYX HD powder in the shade button up
6:17banana mama mama
6:23ok so to finish off the eyes i'm taking this next eyeliner in the shade golden
6:28bronze and i just use that on my waterline and then I took that same
6:33crease shade we used in the beginning of the tutorial well I'm going really fast
6:37and I just blended that under my lower lash line and then i just use the same
6:42highlight shade under my brow bone on my inner corners
6:45ok ok so this shadow is magical it's one of the new kat von d eyeshadows
6:51it's amazing it's in the shade dose go say it's amazing
6:56so I just blended that underneath my lower lashes and then I took that same
6:59matt brown and I just deepen out the outer corner with that
7:03so I wanted like a metallic green e gold
7:07so I went into my uh Nastasia world travel a pallet traveler palette and i
7:12took the shade metallic and I applied it to my lower lash line and my inner tear
7:17duct and a little bit on my top lid as well and i just put on some clinic
7:21mascara and I was going to apply falsies but I i kind of like to look without
7:27policies but you know you do whatever you want
7:31so to contour my face i'm using my physicians formula bronzer in the shade
7:36medium
7:39I think it's the bronze booster bronzer and I think it's the medium shade so I'm
7:44just contouring with this but not like a very harsh contour anything
7:48mainly just warming up my face and also trying to add some runs onto my neck
7:53since my face didn't quite match my neck all that much so I took off my little
7:57heart ears and i'm applying some highlight this is the echo champagne pop
8:03highlighter and i'm highlighting my face and I decided to highlight before blush
8:07today and I don't know why
8:08so I went into this elf palette this is the light blush palette and i took the
8:13really warm
8:14pinchy pinchy No peachy shade and I just decided to stamp that on my face and of
8:20course finishing off the look with the
8:23Miami fever liquid lipstick that completes this makeup look thank you
8:26guys so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you
8:30haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:24no he isn't hey guys so let me address something really quick
0:31my dad decided to play his guitar right when I want to sit down and film the
0:37intro of this video and let's try to look past that
0:51ok so the music didn't stop
0:55so hey guys and this is gonna be a voiceover intro
0:59I wanted to say a couple of things so today's video is going to be a drugstore
1:04makeup tutorial a full-face drugstore makeup tutorial on this look right here
1:08I wanted to do something really really easy like for beginners simple every
1:12single day type of thing
1:13so this is what I came up with i am using the wet and wild pilot in no
1:18filter i believe this is what it's called it's from the fergie line and
1:22mainly using that bronzy pink color which by the way is really similar to
1:25max tan pigment just saying
1:29oh and my brows I want to touch base on them really quickly i use my elf eyebrow
1:34kit so i did use something from the drug store as well
1:37only I didn't film it because I take forever to do my brows and I like this
1:41but I think it makes my brows just a little bit darker than I'd like
1:44I really like bold eyebrows and you guys know it but i like it to come off a
1:48little bit more warm and not as dark as this but I use this from time to time
1:52and yeah I just wanted to tell you guys that so that you don't comment down
1:57below like a eyebrows are scary
1:59I know guys I know so yeah like I said this look is super easy anybody can do
2:05it
2:05I mean it's really really simple and so if you want to see how to get this
2:09drugstore makeup look then just keep watching
2:12so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my milani brow
2:16I highlighter and i'm going to use the matte side and i'm going to apply this
2:19underneath my eyebrows
2:21and just blend it out with my fingers and then add this to the inner part of
2:25my eye as well
2:33next I'm taking my maybelline color tattoo in the shade barely branded and
2:37i'm going to use this to prime my eyes and use it as a base for the eyeshadow
2:41i'm going to put down
2:43yeah
2:49I'm going to line my waterline and my tight line with Maybelline master drama
2:53eyeliner in midnight master as per usual
2:57the eyeshadow i'm going to be using is from this one and wild palette and I'm
3:00using that pinky bronze color of the corner and i'm going to wet my brush
3:04with 6 plus before I dip it into the eye shadow just to intensify it a bit and
3:09then I'm just going to pack this all over my lid
3:27to blend out the harsh lines i'm going to take this matt brown from this next
3:30love in Paris palette because the brown in the wedding on a pallet is too dark
3:35for the crease so I'm going to take that on a mac 217 and just blend out the
3:39edges
3:41this look is pretty simple and soft so I don't want to go too crazy with anything
3:46in the crease
3:47next I'm going to take this lighter shade in the palette and I'm going to
3:51use this to highlight underneath my brow bone this color isn't very pigmented
3:55it's the only one in the palette that doesn't have a lot of pigment to it
3:58which is why i put down that milani base first
4:02next I'm going to take my jordana fabric liner in black and I'm just going to add
4:06a little wing not to sin or not too thick or anything like that
4:09I got too close to the mirror and then I got out of focus because i wasn't paying
4:12attention development focus or not
4:14so yeah you don't have to add a wing but i just wanted to i'm going in with my
4:19L'Oreal voluminous carbon black mascara and my Maybelline the rocket volume
4:22right on top
4:23I'm going to move on to the rest of my face and I'm using my heart candy sheer
4:28envy primer to prime my face
4:32yeah
4:38the foundation I'm using is my revlon colorstay foundation in 250 medium beige
4:44i want to say i haven't it in the description box but i think it's 250
4:48I kept smelling my foundation because i just realized how good this foundation
4:52smells and I never noticed it no yeah that's why i'm selling my lunch but i'm
4:57using this on my Real Techniques sponge
5:01and it looks like i'm stamping my face pretty hard but I'm not just the fast
5:08forward effect that I guess
5:15then I'm going to go in with my Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
5:1715 fair and i'm going to use this to cover up my dark circles and highlight
5:23underneath my eyes a little bit
5:27I'm going to blend that out with my ELF pointed foundation brush
5:36to set that I'm going to use my Maybelline fit me powder in 135 creamy
5:40natural and i'm just going to use this to set my concealer underneath my eyes
5:44to prevent it from creasing and I didn't get a lot of sleep that night
5:50so all the night before so my dark circles were pretty bad even with
5:53concealer over them
5:54let's just ignore that I'm going to take the dark brown and be wet and wild
5:58palette and on a tiny little brush I'm going to smudge this really really close
6:02to my waterline
6:09then with a pencil brush I'm going to go back into that color we used in our
6:12crease and i'm just going to blend out the dark brown just so that it looks
6:16nice and blended and smoked out
6:21I'm going to move on to the rest of my face i'm using my physicians formula
6:25bronze booster and i'm just going to bronze up my face a little bit like I
6:29said this is a really simple day-to-day look so I don't want to contour anything
6:32like that i'm using my ELF complexion brush
6:35I believe that's what it's called I'm just gonna warm up my skin a little bit
6:38take it on my neck and all that jazz
6:45and then I realized

7:09moving on to my lips i am using my revlon matt baume in the color elusive
7:14and i'm just going to put a light layer of this all over my lips and then i'm
7:17going to top it off with a lip gloss and i am using the NYX butter gloss and
7:21fortune cookie

0:22hey guys so today's video is a quick 1i am doing a makeup tutorial on the wire
0:27my breath on the island i'm wearing
0:31I didn't record myself doing my foundation and my concealer and my
0:34powder because i feel like i do that in every video and it's always the same
0:38thing so i skipped that I just did my bronzer my blush my highlight and my
0:42lips
0:43this is save a little bit more time I want to mainly focus this look around
0:46these eyes
0:48so that's what I'm doing today I really hope you enjoyed this video and that you
0:52really like this
0:53I makeup I really do I think it's a nice and a smoky and it sexy i like it very
0:58much
0:59so you want to see how to get this I look then just keep watching
1:02so as usual the first thing I'm doing is priming mad
1:06Mellie girls pro conceal i really love using this concealer to prime my eyelids
1:10because it stays in place all day and it does increase on me
1:13so that's why I'm using this is the Sonia Kashuk I am neutral palette and
1:17I'm like being this palette to death and I've used it and like all of my recent
1:20tutorials but it's really good
1:22I'm taking this cream color shade it's really close to my skin tone and i'm
1:26using this to put all over my I up to my brow bone to set that concealer
1:30I'm going to take this really warm or reddish kind of brown there's a lot of
1:34red to this
1:35Oh what I don't know ok and i am using this as my transition shade this shade
1:40is really important for the other channels we were putting down and it
1:44does take a little bit of building i have to work with this eyeshadow a
1:47little bit because it's not as creamy as the rest of them but once you do you get
1:51a nice reddish brown color
1:53now i'm gonna take this eyeshadow from colour-pop it's called mittens
1:58it's a really really like reddish deep kind of brown
2:02I'm singing throughout this whole video I was feeling my playlist
2:06anyway i'm applying this my entire lid i love this color
2:09it's so gorgeous so i'm applying this all the way up to my crease not really
2:14passing my crease so much just applying it as an all over the lid shade
2:19I'm going to go back into that Brown that reddish brown from the palette and
2:24I'm going to start to blend this color this part takes a long time it's like a
2:28process because we are
2:30I'm trying to mix these two colors really well and blend them together
2:33nicely so just go back and forth it just takes a while but it you get there
2:37eventually
2:38I'm taking grandstand from the new mega be spoiled eyeshadows it's amazing as
2:43you can see by my reaction and on a flat shader brush I'm going to apply this
2:47mainly to the center of my lid like a right
2:50dab in the middle so that a lot of light can reflect to that part of the eye and
2:55i'm going to start applying and animals are blending it into the mittens color a
2:59little bit just working my brush around so that it's not just a stark line of
3:04that color does that make sense
3:05you see me you see me you see me working at mainly in the center of the lid going
3:09back into mittens i'm just going to deepen out the outer part of my eyelid
3:13and my crease a little bit and then freaking out because I think the UPS man
3:19was there for me anyway
3:21and then I'm going to keep it out the inner corner as well i kind of want to
3:24keep the main focus of the grandstand I title right in the center as you can
3:30you said it a million times going right back into that reddish brown and i'm
3:35just going to further blend everything out some more take your time with this
3:38and kind of blend everything together
3:40I'm going to take this cream color again and i'm going to apply this underneath
3:44my brow bone and i'm also going to apply this to the inner part of my eye as well
3:49and then to further highlight because that doesn't give me enough i like I'm
3:55going to go into the white eyeshadow with this tiny little crease brush from
3:59makeup geek and i'm going to apply this the high points of my eyebrows to
4:02highlight and right in my energy reduction as well
4:06the highlights and more I'm taking another makeup eat boiled eyeshadow this
4:11is in the shade

4:19it's a beautiful burgundy color with a lot of like sheen to it but it's just so
4:23pretty and love it this is a tiny crease brush from makeup geek but i use it as a
4:29pencil brush with tiny this is max poster reach
4:32I cool and i am applying this to my waterline and my timeline as well it's a
4:36very very red brown like it's very warm very red
4:41it's a brown but it's a lot of bread to it I'm going to go back into this grants
4:45and eyeshadow and apply it right in the center of my lower lash line there

4:53eyelashes this is the Lancome Lancome souls booster eyelash primer is really

5:05and then I'm just going to go ahead and finish my face I told you guys I already
5:08had my foundation and concealer on so i'm going to move onto bronzer i'm going
5:12to contour using the benefit hoola bronzer and my zoeva one online brush

6:16I'm just kind of putting this everywhere cuz it has like that beautiful
6:18mountainous and Ron -
6:20the same time and then to highlight I'm using the l baked highlighter

1:26keep saying this but I know you guys requested the look that was wearing in
1:29that video like in my makeup geek video and I tried to recreate it last night
1:33and it was totally off
1:36I remember the eyeshadows I used but i don't remember how like I place them and
1:41stuff like that so it didn't look the same
1:44that's why there wasn't a video wednesday morning like midnight when I
1:48usually post because that video did not turn out the way it was supposed to but
1:52yeah I will try again try anyway side no I know that some of you are like how
1:59come you're bloops are not all your videos and stuff like that sometimes I
2:04don't have bloopers like sometimes things go smoothly and I don't have
2:08bloopers and I don't want to make up bloopers I don't want to sit there and
2:11pretend like i have a bunch of bloopers when I don't so I only adds the loops
2:15when the books happen sometimes the balloons don't happen but yeah anyway
2:20I'm rambling at this point I know this is very me this is very warm i do looks
2:25like this all the time where you do the same looks at the time
2:28but it was requested to use this palette and this palette is very warm so that's
2:34why it's another war my shadow we look because using the palette that was
2:38requested to use so don't be mad at me i'm going to be posting like a silver
2:43black smokey eye soon lot more cooler tones looks and i keep saying that but
2:48seriously there in the works anyway if you want to see how to get this suit
2:52just keep watching
2:55ok so you guys know i always start off with my eyebrows already painted have an
3:00eyebrow tutorial on my channel if you're interested but the first thing I'm doing
3:03is I'm going to prime my eyelids and i am using the LA girls pro primer you can
3:09get la girls at drugstore.com i love this primer it's actually really good
3:13and it masks the veins on my eyelids i'm going to take the vegas light palette
3:17and the first I should i am using is desert sands it's probably one of my
3:22favorite colors in this palette it's beautiful it's like vomity kind of brown
3:27it's amazing so I'm just adding that color into my crease kind of like a
3:31transition shade but I'm i was pretty much putting it everywhere i'm taking
3:35this eyeshadow called roulette and then I get excited because so pigmented like
3:41it's crazy pigmented roulette is a beautiful like reddish copper ii
3:45burgundy and no it's gorgeous and I'm using my ELF one-dollar brush which is
3:50actually pretty good if you ask me
3:52so I'm just packing that on my entire lid right up to the crease then I'm
3:57going to take this fluffy brush the same morphe brush and I'm dipping it back
4:02into that desert sand color and I'm gonna rub this back and forth into my
4:07crease and what this is
4:08gonna do is gonna blend the roulette shade and kind of help it melt into the
4:12desert sand shades a little bit now this look doesn't require fix+ but i just
4:17wanted to add just a little bit to intensify it just a little bit more this
4:21eyeshadow is very pigmented on its own but i just added a little bit of fix
4:25plus a little bit of pizzazz then with this Ecotools brush I'm taking me fluffy
4:32side because it's a dual ended brush and I'm going to dip it right back into
4:36desert sands and I'm just gonna start packing this into my crease i'm using a
4:40smaller crease brush to make it a little bit more precise in the crease i'm going
4:44to take mirage and this is gonna be my brow bone highlight this color is so
4:49pigmented i love it and I'm going to take a little wipe and I'm going to
4:53clean up the edges like I usually do make it a little bit sharp at the edges
4:58you can always use tape but I just clean it
5:01I'm gonna take this Stila eyeliner in the shape damn so i believe and I'm
5:05going to tight line with this and I'm going to use this as my water on my
5:08waterline as well this is just a brown eyeliner then I'm going to take the
5:13pigment called liquid gold this is also from makeup geek this is a super intense
5:18green gold pigment like really intense and I'm gonna put in my inner corner
5:23kind of like any little triangle shape and make it look sharp does that make
5:27sense
5:28well you see it's like a little triangle and then I'm gonna add a link to the
5:32outer part of my I kind of like where you would normally put eyeliner just a
5:37little bit different i guess that makes sense i'm never good at explaining but
5:41you can see here huh i'm going to take my Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner and
5:45just add a little flick you guys know every time I try to do an eyeliner
5:50on-camera I get way too close to the mirror and get a frame but here I'm just
5:55priming my face before I finish up my eyes and I'm using my cover effects
5:59calming primary to do that then I'm gonna put on some foundation and i
6:03forgot to show it to you this is the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Foundation in
6:07the shade 40 and I love this foundation it's definitely one of my favorite
6:11drugstore foundations I'm just gonna bump that all of my face using a zlpha
6:16brush
6:20yeah
6:25then I'm gonna add some under-eye concealer this is the Maybelline instant
6:30age rewind dark circle eraser in the shade fair and i'm just adding like that
6:34triangle-shaped highlight as well to further highlight i am taking the
6:38Maybelline magic Lumi pen
6:41I believe that's what is called magic Lumi pen and i'm just going to highlight
6:44my face even more on my nose my forehead around my mouth you know the places
6:49where you would normally highlight and then I'm just gonna blend that out with
6:54the same foundation brush
7:02I'm actually gonna take this product here this is the NARS contour powder in
7:06Paloma it also comes with a highlight shade that's completely matte so I'm
7:10going to take that highlight shade and i'm going to set my under eye concealer
7:12with this thank you to everyone who said that this brush was perfect for setting
7:17my under eye concealer because I was like oh I don't like this brushes too
7:21little for blush but you guys were like no I use that brush to set my under eye
7:25concealer and it works great this is the elf blush brush and you guys are the
7:29best
7:30i'm going to highlight the tops of my cheekbones with this mac cream-colored
7:34base in the shade pearl and i'm just using my fingers to stipple this on my
7:39face because it is a cream product going back to finish off my eyes I'm just
7:43going to smoke out the lower lash line out taking that bottle being shade with
7:48the other side of that equal tools brush and I'm just applying it to my lower
7:51lash line to even out the look and make it a smokier and then I'm going to take

8:35my lashes that break from policies for a little while let's see how long that
8:38lasts but I've been on a no falsies kick for a while now
8:42well like a couple weeks the blush I'm using is this NYX blush in terracotta

2:07there we go and i'm going to start on my eyes I'm using the Jessie's Girl
2:11eyeshadow primer one of my favorite drugstore primers i would say i got it
2:15at Jessie's Girl cosmetics com
2:17now i'm going to take this la girl LA girl Pro prime
2:21this is like a skin tone color well my skin tone a little bit like it and i'm
2:26just using this to cover up all the veins on my eyelids and act as a base
2:30but i do need to set that base
2:32so I'm taking this little lorac Pro matte palette and I'm using the one of
2:36the shade closest to my skin tone to set that base so that there are no tackiness
2:42when I apply the eyeshadows
2:43ok so I'm taking this first color in the palette and I'm using a fluffy brush and
2:48I'm applying this to my crease these colors in the palette don't have names
2:53so you're just gonna go buy me pointing that pointing at them because they don't
2:57have specific names i'm so sorry that's going to get a little confusing
3:00I'm taking this color which is under it it's a little bit more brownish not as
3:04purple and i'm just going to do the same thing I just like the mixture of those
3:08two colors a more mom anymore brown just to act as my transition shade
3:14now i'm going to take this elf brush and dip it into the top corner
3:19eyeshadow this is going to be the all over lid shade
3:22this is such a pigmented shade usually i would go in with a mac fix+ but it
3:26doesn't even need it
3:27it's metallic it's stunning I love it so much it's a nice burgundy color
3:32now i'm taking this brown shade
3:34and a skinnier priest brush and just blending everything together so that
3:39there are no harsh lines and then taking a fluffy brush and just further blending
3:44now this is matt reddish burgundy shade
3:50I love this color I'm taking that same crease brush that I used earlier is it
3:55the same one
3:55well it's like a fat pencil brush and I am just focusing this in the crease and
4:01bringing it to the inner corners as well so on the outer corner and the inner
4:05corner
4:05kind of like a halo look but not really then going back into that fluffy brush
4:10by the way this from sephora i am just blending everything out
4:14you know you know blending Oh going back into that shade we use on the lid and i
4:20just applied some more to intensify it a little then I took that golden shade and
4:24added it to the inner corners and I'm taking this la girl deep bronze eyeliner
4:30and I'm tight lining with this then I'm going to add a wing this is the Jessie's
4:34Girl liquid liner and i'm adding the wing and i always start off with little
4:40strokes and then do the tail but I like I get way too close to the camera and
4:43then you can see me and I'm a total failure i'm so sorry
4:46so let's move on to the face before I finish my eyes I'm just
4:49I was laughing so hard editing this because I look so we're doing that with
4:54my arm but I just spritz the josie maran Nirvana treatment missed on my face and
5:00then i went in with the laura mercier radiance primer so for foundation I'm
5:05using the new to face born this way i'm in warm nude
5:09I love this foundation it gives you a supernatural finish not too mad not do
5:15we either it's just a nice natural finish and it has pretty good coverage
5:20that's my mini review of any of you guys were wondering i really really like it
5:24but I mean I love everything to face makes don't I know it
5:30now i'm taking this like peachy Sammy shade concealer by pixie and i'm
5:36applying that underneath my eyes to help with my dark circles and then I'm gonna
5:40go in with concealer right on top of it
5:43so my concealer is the Maybelline better skin I can't stop using it's just so
5:47easy to blend so lightweight so i'm applying that underneath my eyes to
5:53cover up as well but also to highlight the face so that i'm going to apply it
5:56to other parts of my face to continue to highlight and then look what happens
6:00look my camera got foggy I don't understand how that happened or why and
6:04it's only like in the center because if you see the background it's not very
6:07foggy it's so weird
6:09the camera about foggy i'm using the sedona least 217 brush to blend
6:13everything out
6:15it does say foggy for a little bit longer but only for like a couple
6:18minutes and then it goes back to normal
6:20so I'm sorry so to set my under eye can see there i'm using the NYX HD setting
6:25powder in the shade banana
6:26this is a real techniques setting brush and it's good at setting
6:30let me tell you this is the charlotte tilbury micro smooth powder and i'm just
6:35going to put this on my face
6:37- not really mattify but so that there is no tackiness when I go in with my
6:43bronzer
6:49ok so bronzer of choice i'm using this laguna NARS Laguna bronzer
6:53this is like a limited edition one that came with this tiny to brush and let me
6:57just tell you I love Laguna it's one of my favorite bronzers but this video
7:01brush is not worth the money and a lot of people are like oh it's because that
7:04one short but the big one is worth the money no it sheds like crazy it sheds
7:09like crazy guys it's not worth it don't spend your money on it it's really not
7:13worth it
7:14I I least I don't think so and then I just blend everything out with my Real
7:17Techniques multitask brush so going back to the eyes the fogginess is gone
7:22I just added that same eyeliner to my waterline the one I use to tight line
7:26and then I'm taking that Matt reddish burgundy shade to smoke out the lower
7:32lash line and then a more neutral brown color on the pencil brush and just
7:36really blend everything out so far mascara I'm using my clinic lash
7:41doubling but then i'm going to go in with falsies
7:43these are the ardell demi wispies falsies
7:47and yes that is what I did for my eyes and my eyes are complete
7:50I wanted my skin to look a little bit more luminous not so flat so i took this
7:55one wild bronzer in in in the Cabana
8:02it will be listed below i forgot the name but it is not a bronzer obviously
8:07clearly it just gives it it's like a face powder that gives a nice subtle
8:10Sheen very similar to the hourglass ambient lighting powders for blush this
8:16is nicks mom I was going to say mocha what is wrong with me today okay this is
8:22the NYX blush in the shade moth and i'm using a morphe brush to apply that to
8:26mush eeks for highlight I'm using an oldie but a goodie this is max soft and
8:32gentle every time you use it I'm like huh
8:34why don't you see you every day and then I put it back and I don't use it for a
8:37while
8:37I don't know it's really really pretty you know you can't go wrong with Max
8:41soft and gentle

1:53and just give up watching oh I'm fixing my setup i'll talk about it later but
1:59i'm trying to get my old setup like back in Mississippi back in my life so I'm
2:03working on it
2:04we have you want to get this look then just keep watching so I'm going to prime
2:08my eyelids using the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer you can get this i have
2:13an H you can get this at Jessie's Girl cosmetics that come that's where i
2:17bought it and i really love this primer super shape so we're good
2:23like I mentioned before these color pop eyeshadows are best applied either with
2:31your hands or with a synthetic brush I'm going to take this brush and I got this
2:37in an Ipsy bag or a box each arm kinda remember right now and I don't know
2:42where it's from and just as modern minerals you are gorgeous and I'm going
2:46to go ahead and take the eyeshadow in the shade glow and i'm going to apply
2:51this underneath my brow bone
2:54like i said in my review or like not my review but like i said in my previous
2:59video where I'm talking about these eyeshadows this color obviously is not
3:03going to be a highlight for every skin tone as you can see but again I explains
3:07it in that video i wanted to do a really like cream shade and
3:11I wanted to do a color that they didn't already have so this is what we are
3:14working with
3:15I'm sorry if you have darker skin you definitely can mix it with the map tan
3:19shade and get the perfect highlight color but anyway i'm just applying on
3:24underneath my brow bone
3:26I think you guys and I didn't realize how far you guys were so next I'm going
3:31to take a synthetic brush another synthetic brush like this
3:34this is these away but concealer buffer 142 brush and the way the review is
3:39coming soon I know I keep saying that but it's coming soon
3:42I'm going to take this shade right here called Cornelius it's a very warm
3:47pinky brownie caramely latte color yeah and i'm going to start applying this
3:54into my crease
4:11then I'm going to go in with this shade right here which is called
4:15kathleenlights my favorite one and i'm just going to dip my finger into this
4:21one this one is definitely one that you want to use your finger with cause it
4:26just applies better but look at that
4:28pigmentation good you faint because I good
4:43so I'm just going to apply that to my entire lid like literally everywhere
4:48I'm going to go back into this smaller brush and I'm going to dip it into
4:52kathleenlights again it's so weird
4:54referring it to company lives so strange but i'm going to run that right here
5:09taking this one next this one is blaze this one is so beautiful all over the
5:13lid as well
5:15or like you can take a brush like this and pack it on the outer corners and
5:19that would be really pretty too but I just I love this all over the world and
5:23on this same brush I'm going to run that underneath my lower lash line
5:35and I'm going to bring it all the way in so I can kind of diffuse the gold a
5:40little bit
5:46this one has a lot of glitter to it like a lot of sparkle to it so it's really
5:50really fun to play with
5:52as opposed to the orange e-gold that's more of a sheen then with that same
5:57brush I'm going to take Cornelius and I am going to run that underneath my lower
6:05lash line just to help blend everything together
6:13I'm gonna take prettiest one more time and i'm just going to intensify the
6:17crease a bit
6:19so back into this so Eva concealer brush and just apply some more to my crease
6:27I love this eyeshadow all over the lid by itself like just for an everyday look
6:33love it okay next I'm going to use some eyeliner I'm going to use my favorite
6:38Brown eyeliner
6:39this is the NYX jumbo pencil liner in the shade of brown and i'm going to
6:46tight line with this and apply it to my waterline as well now i'm just taking
6:51some on the top lash line
6:56I i started doing it and completely forgot to explain it so I'm just taking
6:59some of this is a very creamy delicious eyeliner it's great to smudge out
7:05because it gives you the chance to smudge it out because it's not stiff and
7:08dry so I'm just applying it as if I were applying eyeliner really really close to
7:16my lashes and I'm going to take that same rush we've been using and the
7:21smudge it out
7:23Oh
7:28since I want this look to be really messy and like bronzy I don't want to do
7:33a really professional crisp eyeliner
7:35I want something messy and I think it looks really nice
7:40ok so for my inner corners I actually want something sparkly not mad I'm just
7:46going to take one of the colour-pop highlighters
7:49these are going to be coming out very very soon not exactly sure when the
7:53launch date is but very soon and I'm going to take lunch money
7:56it's a beautiful it's probably my favorite one to be honest out of all of
7:59them
8:00it's a beautiful like white gold or renting a lot of moonstone from becca
8:05and i'm just going to play that run in here to finish off the eyes i'm going to
8:15apply some mascara so I'm going to chrome it curl my lashes first
8:24i'm going to apply my estee lauder little black primer all over my lashes
8:29then i'm going to apply Maybelline lash sensational lash sensational
8:36right on top and then for my bottom lashes my clinic bottom lash and i will
8:39be right back
8:40ok so once you put on mascara as you can see it kind of completes the look
8:46lashes would be amazing like i said but I think like like a lot of mascara and
8:51like nice and voluminous and i don't know i think it looks really pretty like
8:56the messy Boheme I feel like its bohemian that weird like I feel a
9:00bohemian live with this makeup anyway i'm going to go ahead and finish the
9:04face
9:04so I'm gonna do things a little different usually I do like my highlight
9:09on my cheeks last but because i'm going to go in with a cream highlight
9:13I'm going to do it first you don't have to but I am going to take the Real
9:18Techniques miracle complexion sponge like camera sturdy here and the
9:24highlight I used in my inner corners this is again
9:27lunch money from colour-pop and i'm going to do my my little thing in here
9:32now going to play that to my cheeks as you can see it's intense I blend that
9:40out now
9:41don't worry
9:45I did there well I didn't have been my sponge before I applied it just to make
9:51it even more intense than I want to take the other side and blend it out so it's
9:55not like you know
9:57ok so now i'm going to go eat with bronze that and actually I'm going to
10:02use this product right here with my 129
10:07this is a bronzer / blush product from the bomb it's called the bong desert
10:13freaking in love with this thing because it's a long wearing product and it is
10:17this is what it looks like me show you
10:20I don't know if you can tell but it's like a brown with kind of like a pinky
10:24undertone
10:25it reminds me a lot of Max harmony blush which is one of my favorite brushes from
10:29Mac because i use it as a bronzer as well i have purchased multiple harmonies
10:35like I love it that much but this is a little bit more pink in it
10:38even so i'm just going to take it on this and I'm going to start rubbing that
10:42I'm a tent is an attempt on the force for heads a fivehead Who am I kidding
10:50and I'm not so I mean I guess I mean that I'm not contouring
11:01I'm just bronzing up the skin obviously defining my cheekbones a little bit so a
11:07little bit of contour
11:08it's very very pigmented when you have to be a little bit careful use a light
11:12hand but it's super long wearing like it last all day on the skin and I think
11:17it's a really pretty color
11:18it isn't that I don't know if I mentioned that put the same brush I'm
11:22just going to add a little bit more glow factor a little bit more once a little
11:27bit going to me i'm going to stop drinking coffee before the videos
11:32this is the NYX blush in death a call that and i'm going to put that on the
11:38sheiks just to give a little bit of a glow by the way because i don't have
11:42this blush and you like warm things like why why don't you have it it's really
11:47good and so she used to do you see what's in my mouth
11:53this brush said like a mofo and it was so expensive i paid so much money
11:59I mean it's a great brush I use it all the time but they these mac brushes shed
12:04and and they scratched my face a little bit just a little bit
12:08ok so i am done with my faucet my face and I'm gonna move on to lips I'm going
12:15to take this colour-pop lippie pencil in cake and I lightly go lightly because
12:21this is pick up meant it
12:24gonna apply that and then blend it out with my finger then i'm going to apply
12:30the color pop let me stick that I cannot find I about it
12:42this is Skippy it's a glossy finish not a fan of this on its own but i do like
12:49on top of lip liner like it just put I want my lips to be even glass here which
12:56is a big surprise since i'm a mac kind of gal I'm going to take this dose of
13:00colors lip gloss in the shade
13:02well you know has mean I'm pretty sure this is called undressed
13:13i'm pretty sure it's not on the damn bottle but pressure
13:17ok so that completes this makeup tutorial using the where that line where

14:05thank you guys so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already
14:09and I will see you in my next video
0:17hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look it's
0:21actually really similar to things I've done in the past but i wanted to do a
0:25like orangie Randy smoky using this eyeshadow right here that i have been
0:34using and loving these are the Knicks prismatic eyeshadows and I've always
0:40thought that they were good but I didn't realize how good they were until
0:43recently
0:44oh so you want to laugh
0:48it didn't highlight the inner corner of his eye
0:58ok let's ignore that I ended the video without even doing that
1:04Wow if you haven't tried to these prismatic eyeshadows my next they are
1:10probably one of the best drugstore
1:12if not the best drugs yes they're at the best single eyeshadows at the drug store
1:16right now and I can't believe you haven't been using I got the man I mats
1:19and i can't believe i haven't been using them every single e so this is the look
1:25i came up with it
1:26I know it's similar to things I've done what I wanted to do a full face drug
1:30sort through and I wanted to do something that's perfect for a night out
1:34especially now that we're in the summer with a really like eyeliner so if you
1:39want to get this look then just keep watching
1:42I just quickly wanted to show you guys that I did in my eyebrows using
1:44drugstore products but they take forever so I didn't show it i use the elf
1:47Broadway's and like the loreal brow mascara
1:51so now moving on to priming my eyes
1:53i'm using the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer i purchased mine off of jessie's
1:57girl calm and i love it i love this primary really makes the eyeshadows
2:01stick onto my lid
2:03i'm going to use a base because i want the gold to really pop underneath the
2:07eye shadow so this is a milani eyeshadow stick
2:10not sure what the name is but i'll have it listed below now taking the Knicks
2:15prismatic eyeshadow in the shade bedroom eyes
2:18i'm applying this to my entire lid with a flat shader brush i'm not exactly sure
2:21why I'm going so slow like i'm applying this eyeshadow very slowly and i don't
2:26know why but i love the prismatic eyeshadows if you don't own any please
2:30go out and purchase them they're all good every single one
2:34there's so intense they feel very high-end luxurious then I'm taking this
2:39morphy fluffy brush I like this one because it's very very like small it's a
2:44small fluffy brush
2:46this is the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and I'm taking the orange
2:50color reminds me a lot of a mixture between makeup geeks chickity and peach
2:56smoothie
2:57it's like a nice warm transition shade so i'm using this brush to blend out the
3:03prismatic eyeshadow
3:04so there are no harsh lines and to give that extra little warmth to the crease
3:08then I'm gonna go into this brown eyeshadow right here
3:12yes that one and the palate with the same brush and I'm just going to do the
3:16exact same thing because I do want to add more Brown to it I don't want it to
3:19be just like a straight-up orange crease
3:21even though i like that I just want to add more Brown to the crease there
3:29then I'm just taking a big fluffy brush with no eye shadow and blending things
3:34out so there are no harsh lines you know going into this other prismatic
3:39eyeshadow in the shade girl talk and I'm applying this to my brow bone just to
3:44give a little bit of shine I don't want to apply too much because this is a very
3:47pigmented eyeshadow
3:48so I'm barely tapping it and then I'm going into the white in the palette and
3:52I'm applying that underneath my brow bone
3:54i layered the other one underneath that I didn't want it to be just like a flat
3:57white shape
3:59so that's why then I'm going to go into a brush really similar to a mac 217 it's
4:04like a paddle fluffy blending brush and I'm going to go back into that orange
4:08shade and i'm really going to start blowing out that orange color like I
4:12decided I wanted to be a little bit more orangie in the crease
4:15you know my style so yeah that's just what I'm doing here going back and forth
4:19with that color and then I'm going to take this eyeliner from la girl and I'm
4:25tight lining with this and then i'm applying a little bit to my top lashes
4:29just too just so I could look like there's eyeliner there but there really
4:32isn't
4:33so I'm going to finish off my eyes I mean my face before I finish my eyes
4:37you know i'm priming my face with the Loreal magic Lumi light infusing primer
4:44I believe that's what it's called
4:46and then I'm going to go on with this foundation I wanted to use it because i
4:48haven't used in a long time
4:50i'm using this alpha buffer brush this is the neutrogena healthy mix foundation
4:55I'm in the shade 40 even though mmm i noticed it looks maybe a little too
4:59light
4:59but it's ok bronzer can fix that so I'm applying this to my whole face it gives
5:04a nice radiant just like Chloe look without being too greasy or too much i
5:09really like this foundation
5:10I don't know i don't use it more because it's nice
5:13then for concealer decided to bust out this LA girl Pro conceal
5:21I haven't used it in a long time this is the shape creamy beige
5:24excuse me i'm singing to get this in creamy beige and I hate the packaging i
5:30think i don't use this as much because the packaging is just so hard to squeeze
5:33this concealer out so it drives me nuts but it's an amazing concealer
5:38so i use it so I just started blending all that out and then I remembered
5:44hey this is not the brochure like to use to blend
5:47I'm gonna grab my sedona lace - 17
5:50the perfect brush to blend out my under eye concealer i love it when I said we
5:54wait wait wait
5:55and I decided to plop on the Maybelline magic Lumi highlighting pen this is in
6:01the shade ivory
6:02I like to apply this on top of my concealer because it just brightens my
6:05under eyes a lot more it's not
6:08opaque enough or doesn't have enough coverage to be a concealer on its own
6:10but i do like to use it as a highlighter
6:14that's what i'm doing and then I'm just blending everything out
6:19yeah
6:24I don't know what's wrong with me I'm sorry but yes moving on
6:28so I've decided to do cream products i'm i'm putting on a bunch of cream products
6:33under my powder products so I'm taking the Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer in rich
6:38bronze I like this one more than warm tan it's just a little bit darker and
6:42not as like orange looking so i'm applying this with a makeup geek
6:46stippling brush and I'm just kind of contouring with this and then it falls
6:50off and almost fell out of my hand there anyway back to this
6:55oh my god my roots are so terrible like I cannot believe I haven't had my roots
6:59yet i'm going to do that soon but holy crap there so bad anyway I'm taking the
7:04Real Techniques stippling brush and I'm applying the elf cream blush in the
7:10shade
7:11peach perfection to my cheeks and I barely put anything on honestly the step
7:14was pointless because i barely put any blood on I wanted it to be mostly bronzy
7:19then I'm going to take this
7:21l'oreal lumi cream highlight this is in the shade golden and i'm applying this
7:26to my cheekbones I don't like the powders in this line but i really like
7:29the liquid illuminators that l'oreal just recently came out with so because i
7:33hadn't set my concealer with powder i blend it out with my finger just to get
7:37rid of some of the creases and now i'm going to set my under eye concealer
7:41this is a NYX powder that I couldn't open in the shade banana and this is
7:46just like a paddle brush from zoeva and i am setting my under eyes so that they
7:51don't crease and they stay in place
7:53my concealer there's a place
7:56then i'm going to go ahead and bronze with a powder bronzer now just like to
8:00set everything
8:01this is a Jane bronzer in the shade inspire and this is a morphe brush from
8:06the elite collection and i am just bronze and on my face I'm not doing
8:10anything super crazy not contouring just you know being drowsy
8:15then I'm going to take this highlighter / bronzer by Milani it's called
8:19fantastic and gold and I applied my brush and like the white sections just
8:25so i can add a highlight to my cheeks because if i would have applied it like
8:28in a bronzy section would have been too dark so that is what I did and then I
8:32finished off my eyes by applying that same brown eyeliner to my waterline and
8:37then I really got up in there and I just like a plan I'm like blinking a lot
8:41because i don't like to tug on my eyes but I apply a thick layer of that to my
8:45lower lashline a lot thicker than I normally do and then I just kind of
8:49blend it out with a brush just so that everything could be nice and even and
8:54then with a more dense pencil brush I'm going to dip it into that orange shade
8:58and just go over everything so it doesn't look like a raccoon I so that
9:01everything is nice and blended and it just looks smoky not like a harsher
9:06brown line then the mascara i'm using is from Maybelline and this is there miss
9:10manga rock mascara and I applied it to my top and bottom lashes so to finish
9:15off this look I just took the revlon super lustrous matte lipstick and smoked
9:20peach and i decided i wanted it to be glossy not mat and a little bit more
9:24pink not so peach
9:25so I took the elf extra lip gloss in the shade brian and i just applied it on top
9:30and then that's completes this make this world i really hope you guys enjoyed
9:35please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you among those video

0:59benefits in this has a very sheer breathable coverage but it does do a
1:05good job of evening out my skin tone and blurring my pores as you can see it does
1:09have a runny texture so BB water is the perfect name because it honestly feels

1:17I really like that it has a good amount of SPF it is SPF 30 which is great to
1:23wear during the day so we can protect your skin

1:56and then I'm just going to be blending that in
2:03i'm also applying that on other parts of my face to highlight and also blending
2:08that in
2:14i'm going to set the places where i apply the concealer and i'm using this
2:19NYX HD powder in the shade
2:21banana this is going to help prevent it from creasing underneath the eyes and
2:27just to make everything set nicely
2:31next I'm going to move onto bronzing up the skin I'm not going to contour just
2:35want a nice warm complexion and i am using the physicians formula bronze
2:39booster in the shade medium

3:04geek blush in the shade romance
3:06it's a nice soft pink but it does have a gold Sheen to it is really pretty good
3:10the beautiful glow to the skin
3:16and now i'm going to highlight my cheeks using the colour-pop super shock cheek
3:22highlight in the shade wisp

3:27applying on the tops of my cheekbones on my nose and anywhere I want to look more
3:31glowy
3:32now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm going to keep it very simple just to
3:36match the rest of my face makeup ever already primed my eyes and I'm going to
3:40go in with a fluffy brush and dip it into the morphe eyeshadow in vs 13 and
3:46I'm just going to move my brush in windshield wiper motions and apply this
3:49into my crease
3:50now i'm going to take this vanilla shade it is BS 54 also from morphe and on a
3:57pencil brush i'm just applying this underneath my brow bone to highlight and
4:02then I'm going to take this eyeshadow also from morphe it is BS 76 and i'm
4:07applying this to my entire eyelid wet so I did what the eyeshadow just to
4:11intensify it a little bit more and i am just applying this on my entire lid all
4:16the way up to my crease
4:21after that I'm going to take that same highlighting Shady's underneath my brow
4:24bone and apply it to my inner corners to highlight that area too
4:28then I'm going to go back into the original shade we use first and applying
4:34this underneath my lower lashes just to smoke it out a little bit and then to
4:38finish off the eyes i am just using my L'Oreal telescopic carbon black mascara
4:43on my top and bottom lashes so to complete this look I'm going to use this
4:48over a long lasting liquid lipstick in the shade real i'm applying a light
4:52layer to my lips and then i'm going to dab it with my finger just so that it's
4:56not too intense and opaque and i'm just going to top it off with this Ellie
5:00girls jelly lip gloss it's a nice peachy color so that completes this look that
5:06you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
5:09will see you in my next video bye
0:25hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look right
0:31here
0:31it's very dramatic for me at least
0:35I just wanted to go in like a different direction from my recent videos I've
0:38done kind of more natural simple tutorial which I love doing because I
0:43feel like those are easier to recreate what I wanted to do something like more
0:46smoky more like nighttime appropriate i would definitely wear this on a night
0:52out on the town and I didn't want to do anything warm i wanted to do a little
0:56bit more cool tone
0:58I wanted to use more cool tones actually use the Anasazi artist probably because
1:03i've only used it once in a tutorial and I wanted to use it again and the like
1:08pop of silver is this bad boy right here this is the makeup geek foiled eyeshadow
1:13in high wire so i really like how this turned out it's like a bluish silver
1:18smokey eye and i hope you guys enjoyed it if you want to see how to get these
1:22loop and just keep on watching
1:24ok so my eyelids are already primed now i'm just going to jump into this palette
1:28i'm going to take the shape buttery and i'm going to apply this all over my lid
1:32all the way up to the brow bone with the morphe 14 brush just you know to create
1:37like a base for all the shadows to blend well because i use Mac painterly Paint
1:41Pot and that can stay a little bit tacky if I don't get it
1:44then I'm going to take some scotch tape and put that on the side of my eye to
1:48create like a sort of cat eye shape and then i'm going to go into dusty rose and
1:53I'm using the morphe e23 brush this is like my new Holy grill like fluffy
1:59crease brush its toll good i love it anyway so i'm just applying dusty rose
2:03into the crease from the tape all the way to the inside of my I you know I
2:08mean yeah i'm going to take blue velvet
2:11this is the star of the show and this color
2:15you just have to build it up this part like it's a little bit tedious but you
2:19just have to stick with it and work with it i'm using the morphe e17
2:23it's the perfect brush for this because it's like a small crease brush but it's
2:28perfect
2:29it fits right into my crease perfectly anyway so i'm applying that on the outer
2:34part of my eye where the tape is and then I'm dragging it all the way in my
2:37crease as you can see what I'm doing of course and then i'm going to start
2:45applying some eye shadow in the very inner corners of my eyes so basically
2:49I'm putting the blue everywhere except the center of the lid because we're
2:53going to be applying that silver color there so we wanted the Blue to like hug
2:57the silver if that makes sense i mean i always say if that makes sense because i
3:01know it makes sense right yeah
3:03so yes I'm just working back and forth with that color and then i'm going to go
3:07in to make it Peaks boiled eyeshadow in the shade high wire it's like a very
3:11intense silver but it has kind of like an icy blue tinge to it so I like how it
3:16pairs with the navy blue
3:18i'm applying that on the center of my eyelid with a mac 27 know with a mac 239
3:22brush and yes
3:25then I'm going to go back into blue velvet and i'm just going to do the
3:29exact same thing just to intensify the blue and so that the high wire sheet can
3:34blend with the blue
3:37yeah
3:39yeah
3:43yeah
3:45yeah
3:45yeah
3:47then I'm gonna rub off any excess eyeshadow on that brush and then i'm
3:53going to start blending out the harsh edges
3:56I didn't want to add more blue because it would get a little bit muddy so just
3:59clean off the brush and started to smoke out the harsh lines then back into dusty
4:06rose with that same brush I'm going to start blending out the crease
4:10I really like how it looks like the navy blue and it kind of fades into like a
4:14dusty mauve I think it looks really pretty so I'm just applying this right
4:18where the navy blue eyeshadow ends so it looks like a nice and gradient effect
4:22and there are no harsh lines that way either
4:32going right back into the buttery i'm gonna use this as my brow bone highlight
4:37i'm also applying that in my inner corners even though i go back with a
4:42different eye shadows later but anyway yeah
4:45taking the Knicks gel liner in black i'm just applying this to my tight line I
4:49don't like to pull at my eye
4:50that's why i started making these crazy eye movements because i don't like
4:54talking at my eyelids then i'm going to apply some liquid liner this is the NYC
4:59liquid liner and i'm just applying a regular little wing i'm using the tape
5:04kind of like a guideline to where I want the wing to end and then after that I'm
5:12going to move onto my face before it finished my eyes to prime my face and
5:15using the NYX angel veil primer
5:17this is a little bit of a mattifying primer but I find that it doesn't dry
5:21out my skin then i'm going in with my morphe e6 brush and like my new favorite
5:26foundation
5:26this is the ex1 invisible wear foundation i'm an f100 and i'm just
5:31going to apply this on my entire face
5:33this is like a very natural foundation it's like a medium coverage but it just
5:38looks like seconds in it's beautiful and so nicely
5:42I just I love this foundation and this brush has been
5:46heavenly I love it out of stock which totally sucks but I'm hoping that they
5:51will bring it back and stop very soon because it's a good one is a good one
5:55then I'm going to take this Maybelline master conceal it concealer in the shade
6:02fair i believe and you've seen me do is about a million times I'm just blending
6:06that out with my holy grail concealer blender brush the visa don't lace
6:10- 17 I love this to blend out my under eye concealer
6:15it's just so soft and like the perfect size
6:18ok so i just get through that really quickly but I'm taking the Knicks
6:24contour kit
6:25and I'm gonna take the yellow and like the pinky shade and I mix them together
6:29and i'm going to set my under eye can see there with this this is a deli am
6:33tools like highlighter brush
6:42and then I'm going to go ahead and finish off my eyes before I complete my
6:45face
6:46I'm going to go right back into blue velvet and I'm gonna use a makeup geek
6:50pencil brush and I'm going to apply this underneath my lower lashes i had already
6:54applied applied a black eyeliner but i forgot to film that but I just apply
6:59black eyeliner to my waterline and now i'm just smoking out that blue shadow
7:03and I'm dragging it all the way across
7:06I'm going to take the black eyeshadow in the palette called cold and with that
7:11same pencil brush I'm going to smudge that on
7:14yeah and then I put the pallet in the camera and yeah there you go kathleen
7:19i'm just nudging this on the outer view of my I just a deep in that part of a
7:22bit and then to further blend everything so it's not like a harsh dark line
7:28underneath
7:29I'm taking dusty rose and I'm just blending all those colors together to
7:33smoke it out
7:34i'm applying some mascara and then I applied my ardell demi wispies on my
7:39lashes and then that completes the I look so to finish off my face I'm gonna
7:45go right back into the next contour kit i'm using this elf blending brush it is
7:49amazing to contour with it's amazing
7:52so I'm just contouring my face with that cooler tone shade in the next contour
7:56kit and I just love this brush if you guys haven't checked it out check it out
8:01from ELF it's really really inexpensive and it's just so soft and amazing i love
8:06it is just contouring my face like a normally do
8:12then I'm going to go in with this color right here
8:17it's just a little bit warmer than the other one not too warm not orange or
8:21anything and i'm just going to go over that contour again
8:28then I picked up my hair because it was driving me crazy
8:33anyway I'm taking this yellow banana shade and i'm applying it right under my
8:36contour with that deli and tools brush just to intensify the contours just
8:41gonna sharpen it a little bit
8:43and since this look at the little bit dramatic I want my contour to stand out
8:46a lot more than it normally would
8:48now i'm going to do something that i've been loving recently this is the girl
8:52lactic face glow in the shade natural and I'm doing this on a giant so a brush
8:56and I'm applying this everywhere
8:58this is a highlight for the face but it's like the most natural highlight
9:01that it just gives my face in below i put this pervert where I'm all of its
9:07glowy and it makes your skin look nice and radiant without looking grease your
9:10shiny
9:11it's fabulous I'm gonna go in with this to face blush in the shade baby love
9:17it's their new long-lasting 16-hour blushes and I'm taking this brush that
9:21looks like it's for me cool tools but it's not I got it at TJ maxx i don't
9:24even know the brand but it's a big fluffy brush very similar to equal tools
9:28and i'm applying this on my cheeks i really like this color because the
9:31natural color that goes with any makeup looks
9:35I'm going right back into the Galactic face below and natural and applying this
9:40as my highlight I would have normally gone with a more intense highlight but
9:43it was the highlight that was ready for me is how I use it on my cheekbones
9:47well I just packed on a little bit more than I did on my face of course then I
9:51took a pencil brush from sigma and i applied this to my inner corners just to
9:56intensify the inner corner a bit event of it
10:00and then for lips i'm using this essence lipstick in the shade also matt and then
10:06I thought it was just a little bit too Matt I wanted something a little glass
10:08here so i took the revlon lipstick and pink
10:11cognito to give it a little bit more shine and then that completes this
10:15makeup look I really hope you guys enjoyed it please subscribe if you
10:19haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look it's using the new
0:05Manny and makeup geek palette
0:07I know it's currently sold out but i will link it below once it comes back in
0:10stock and it was really really requested to do a look using that palette so i
0:15thought i would give it to you guys now this look definitely calls for fake
0:20lashes but i could not find my eyelash flew anywhere but it would definitely
0:24look better with some policies also i do want to say that my eyelids look a
0:29little bit patchy because i didn't use a very good base underneath
0:33I should have gone in with like a dark basement like a deep purple base but i
0:37just used regular like clear eye shadow primer so i'm going to go ahead and get
0:42started but keep that in mind
0:44so I'm setting down the primer i use and i'm using the wet and wild
0:48eyeshadow in from brulee now i'm going into the palette i'm going to take the
0:53shade of peaches and cream on a fluffy brush and I'm just going to both that
0:57into my crease and then i just added some tape to create a sharper edge
1:02i'm going in with the shade Sora which is kind of like beaches and cream but
1:06like a deeper version really really beautiful and I'm also building that
1:10into Z Greece
1:11I'm going to take the shade of Mars it's a beautiful red shade like really
1:16stunning I'm taking it on it
1:17skinnier crease brush something a little bit more precise and I am just applying
1:21this to the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging it into my crease
1:26now i'm going to take the all over lid shade and this is Aphrodite
1:30i highly recommend you go in with like a base before this step like a deep
1:35plumber like an eyeliner and put it all over your lid because i didn't use a
1:39very good primer so it came off a little bit patchy because it didn't have like a
1:43nice base and I'm just going back into
1:47shade Mars and I'm just blending that into the crease again I want the crease
1:51to be very very red so I'm just adding a little bit more of that color and now
1:56i'm going back into sora with a fluffy brush and just blending that out because
2:00I don't want any harsh lines in my crease
2:03ok so going back to Aphrodite I'm just intensifying the lid just in case some
2:08of it got blended with all that blending and then I just took the exact same
2:13shade Aphrodite and just put that directly into my crease so that it
2:17blends really nicely into the red shade to highlight underneath my brow bone i
2:21used Luna which I probably shouldn't have because my eyebrows look a mess
2:26I'm trying to grow them out i told you guys this already but I'm trying to grow
2:29them out to reshape them so highlighting with a shimmery highlight probably
2:32wasn't a good idea about what ever use anyway so i'm applying some primer to my
2:37face I use the next angel primer and now i'm going in with the ex1 and visit wear
2:41foundation it was a little bit dark for me
2:44casino mama very fair these days but this is in the shade f100 and I'm just
2:49buffing that into my face using a wet and wild flat top kabuki brush and then
2:54i'm going to go in with concealer this is the NARS radiant creamy concealer in
2:57the shade vanilla and for a second I thought I smelled something burning
3:02but then I just kept on filming because i am a very responsible adult filming
3:07comes first
3:08who cares of the house is on fire ok so i am applying this by the way that was a
3:13joke
3:14I assumed it was the candle burning behind me
3:17so yes anyway I'm just blending that nars radiant creamy concealer into my
3:22skin using the 447 brush i applied that underneath my eye
3:27between my eyebrows and just other places of my face I wanted to highlight
3:31and yeah just working on it
3:33doing the thing I usually do i'm going to set all the places i added concealer
3:40and i'm using my RC may know color powder and you know that in my face
3:45this foundation doesn't have like a weird tacky finish so i find that I
3:49don't need to set the rest of my face just the places i added some concealer
3:54so now i'm going to finish up my eyes I'm using the bombs swing and i wanted
3:57to show you guys look at my hand is shaking
3:59I had such a hard time applying eyeliner this day I don't know why my hand was
4:04like shaking so bad look
4:06it's just I couldn't do it so yeah I struggled a little bit with my eyeliner
4:10but I tried to make it work
4:12i'm applying my kiko extra scoop of volume mascara and then I'm gonna work
4:16on my lower lash line
4:18I took the shade frappe on a pencil brush and buff that I'm gonna need my
4:22lashes and then I highlighted my inner corners with blue now this is such a
4:26beautiful inner corner highlight fabulous i'm taking my Urban Decay
4:30eyeliner in the shade mainline it's a really cool teal cool peel blue colors
4:36amazing
4:37so i'm just applying it to my waterline and then kind of blending that a little
4:40bit with a pencil brush and now i'm going in with insomnia it's a beautiful
4:46blue brown reddish she has a bunch of different ships
4:50it's such a pretty color and i just bought that on my lower lash line and
4:54then i just applied some mascara
4:56now i'm going to contour my face i'm using the wet and wild contour brush and
5:00then mixing two shades am using warm porcelain and
5:03cool porcelain these are the makeup geek contour powders I really really like
5:08them and I love mixing these two specific shape to get like a perfect
5:12contour for blush I'm using the Milani baked blush and barium or I love this
5:18blush
5:18I feel like it goes with so many looks and since the eyes are a little intense
5:22I didn't want to go you know to one chance but i am going into dance with my
5:26highlight this is the wet and wild highlight in the shade Hollywood
5:30Boulevard such a stunning like golden shade so beautiful so i'm just reading

2:47tight I'm gonna do my best i will update
2:49you but if you do have this palette or
2:51it's coming to you in the mail this is
2:53the look i created today I used the
2:55greens in the palette kind of mix them
2:57both to get this like really pretty
2:58emerald look this is my favorite way to
3:00use the greens in this palette they're
3:02really really pretty on their own but
3:04makes together they are magical i love
3:06the combination of the two so that is
3:07what i did today and yeah if you want to
3:10see how to get this look then just keep
3:12watching
3:13okay so I'm gonna start with priming my
3:15eyelids i'm using the Urban Decay primer
3:17potion that i always use and then i'm
3:20going to jump into the palette and I'm
3:21going to use this bone color to kind of
3:23set down the primer make sure it's not
3:25sticky and everything blends smoothly on
3:28top so on a fluffy crease brush I'm
3:30taking this peachy orange shade and i'm
3:32going to use this as my transition shade
3:33and putting this pretty much everywhere
3:36on my crease and then i'm going to go
3:39into this little mustard fellow right
3:41here and I'm going to take another
3:42blending brush and really focus this
3:45into my crease and just blending those
3:47two shades together
3:49now i'm going to take a flat shader
3:56brush and zip into this color right here
3:58it's a very mossy green has a lot of
4:01brown to it and i'm going to apply this
4:02to my entire lid and then I took a
4:10fluffy crease brush with no additional
4:11product and blend it out those harsh
4:14lines then i apply this green eyeshadow
4:17right on top so i use the same brush
4:19only I flipped it over and applying this
4:22eyeshadow on top creates kind of like a
4:23really dark emerald look I really love
4:26these two shadows paired together and
4:30then I dip the brush back into that
4:32little mustard shade and i'm using this
4:35to blend everything out making sure all
4:37the colors look nice and blend it into
4:39one another
4:40going back into the palette i'm going to
4:43take this cool tone grey Brown and I'm
4:46going to use kind of like a smaller
4:47crease brush and I'm focusing this color
4:49on the outer parts of my eyes and I'm
4:51also dragging this into the crease just
4:53so that they all mesh well together
4:56I feel like it was missing something so
4:58i added a little bit of that cool tone
4:59brown and then I went back into that
5:03mustard shade and I'm just you know
5:04blend away just lots and lots of
5:07blending going back into this bone color
5:10I'm going to use this to highlight
5:12underneath my brow bone so I took a
5:13little bit of that eyeshadow and then I
5:15dip my brush into this really intense
5:17highlighting shade but I didn't apply a
5:20lot so just a little bit of that
5:21underneath my brow bone just to give it
5:23a little bit something extra and for my
5:26eyeliner I'm using the English gel liner
5:28number 77 i am like the world's worst
5:31eyeliner draw or whatever you know it's
5:35really hard to do this on camera so just
5:37apply a wing or don't apply wing do
5:39whatever you want but i just applied
5:40kinda like a smallish medium-sized wing
5:43and then I decided to move on to the
5:45face before finishing up the eyes i
5:47primed my face using the NYX angel
5:49primer and then the foundation I'm using
5:52is the Milani concealing perfect found
5:54foundation this in the shape creamy
5:57vanilla
5:57this is like extremely yellow i have a
6:00neutral yellow undertone but this is
6:02like yellow but it doesn't look so bad
6:05in the end after applying concealer and
6:08all of that so the concealer i'm using
6:10is the collection lasting perfection
6:12ultimate concealer this in the shade
6:15fair and i'm doing one side at a time
6:17because it is a very mac concealer and
6:20it dries very very quickly so i added a
6:22little bit more and this is very
6:23brightening but it covers really well i
6:26love this concealer and then I applied
6:29some of the Wet n Wild highlighting and
6:31concealing pen right on top just to
6:33balance out the color because the
6:35foundation was just a little bit too
6:37yellow for me so I'm just blending that
6:40in with my Beauty Blender up and then to
6:45set down that concealer i am using my
6:48favorite RCA no color powder
6:52ok so to finish up the eyes i'm gonna
6:58dump dump
7:00whoa what I meant to say i'm going to
7:02jump into the mustard shade again and
7:05i'm using kind of a thicker pencil brush
7:07and I'm applying this to my lower
7:09lashline and then I took the colour-pop
7:12cream gel liner in the shade teaspoon
7:15and i'm applying this to my waterline
7:16and I know I'm like pulling on my eyes
7:18here I never do that I'm so sorry but I
7:20was just trying to apply it as pigmented
7:22as I could so I'm to create a little bit
7:25of darkness underneath my lower lashline
7:27i took that dark green shade on a tiny
7:29little pencil brush and really smoked
7:31out that color and then I applied some
7:34more of that mustard shade just to tie
7:36everything together and to smoke it out
7:38a bit for mascara i am taking the
7:41essence lash princess on my top and
7:44bottom lashes and then i'm going to
7:47apply some inner corner highlight with
7:48this super intensifying highlighting
7:51shade in the palette it's my favorite
7:53for my inner corners
7:54I think it's stunning so I applied that
7:56to my inner corners and then
7:58I popped on some falsies these are the
8:00iler looks like pho mink lashes and
8:03they're really beautiful to add some
8:06black to my tight line just so that
8:08everything looks nice and black i used
8:10the essence smoky liner in smoky black
8:13so let's contour the face shall we this
8:16is the chemical on sculpting powder in
8:18the shade light and i'm using this to
8:20contour my cheekbones this just become
8:24my ultimate favorite contour powder of
8:26all time
8:26this new like light shade it's my
8:28favorite chisels out the cheeks like
8:30nothing i love it it's perfect and then
8:33to just warm up the skin a bit i took
8:35the bhcosmetics satin bronzer in the
8:38shade totally tan and this just warmed
8:41up my skin a little bit because the
8:43cabin upon potter obviously is a little
8:45bit more cool ton't
8:49i also took some of that on my neck so
8:52that everything matched nicely think i'm
8:56losing my voice and ok so for blush i am
9:00taking these you a powder blush in the
9:02shade rose very beautiful pinky mavi
9:05color very beautiful i love it and then
9:09I'm going to take the jcat Triple Crown
9:12baked eyeshadow in the shade
9:14what is this called due diligence that's
9:16right industry due to the legend and i'm
9:18using this to highlight my face my nose
9:20my Cupid's ball all the good stuff for
9:24lips i took the remote exaggerated full
9:27color lip liner in the shade natural and
9:29I just lined my lips and I also filled
9:32it in with this lip liner and then to go
9:36right on top of that lip liner I took
9:38the NARS above it matte lip pencil in
9:41the shade Bettina it's a similar color
9:42only the NARS the pencil is more purple
9:45so you have that complete this look I
9:47hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much
9:49for watching please the trip if you
9:51haven't already and I will see you in my
9:52next video bye
0:13you wanna hear something funny i sat down to film this video and i did one
0:18eye and there was someone there was a lot of fun and then I started filming
0:23and there was no son there's a tornado happening in Florida or something
0:27because the Thunder and the lightning and the rain is so intense that I
0:32couldn't film the lighting is absolutely horn and I know it's going to be a lot
0:36of people commenting saying where are your lights you were talking about like
0:40and yes i know i have been talking about like I've been saying that I'm gonna get
0:43lights but something happened long story has to do with my room and it's a long
0:51story of why I cannot put lights in this room especially the lights that I want
0:56they don't fit i did not explain it my room is tiny here and they just don't
1:01fit so i'm not going to have lights till I'm back home which would be next month
1:05so in a month in a month i'll be on my lighting game
1:11I'm just so stressed out because so many things are going wrong with videos
1:15lately i updated i'm moving and i have no idea how to use the new imovie I
1:19already sucking editing to begin with it is just a hot mess so I got final cut
1:23pro and I'm trying to learn how to use that my friend is teaching me how to use
1:26it and it's just that is the reason why there has been a lack of videos this
1:31week like all of this week and it is because the rain doesn't stop and I'm
1:36trying to learn a new editing software so please bear with me please
1:42the so honestly it has never been this dark in this room ever when I'm filming
1:46usually when it's this dark I'm like forget it I'm not filming today but I
1:49have missed so many videos this week that I thought maybe a dark one or a
1:54shadowy one was better than none
1:57maybe not maybe you guys are like no this is way too dark
2:00I'm not even watching this I don't know I'm stressed out anyway sorry for long
2:05intro i wanted to just update you on a couple of things but today's tutorial is
2:09using the it cosmetics not
2:11leave pretty palette I wanted to do something that was like really smoky and
2:16suitable for like a night out on the town and you can obviously make this a
2:20little bit more dramatic and add false lashes I didn't I never do but i really
2:25really love this look because it is using the more darker shade in the
2:30palette i use the purple and the navy blue so it's kind of like a wearable way
2:34to wear navy blue and purple I feel because those colors seem to be a little
2:40bit less wearable and since this palette is full everyday natural colors i
2:44decided to pump it up a little bit and make it more next time
2:46appropriate I thought it looked pretty good if you want to see how to get this
2:50night out
2:51smokey eye using this palette then just keep watching
2:54so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to be taking my Mac painterly
2:58Paint Pot and i'm going to be using this to prime my eyelids and cover up all
3:02those veins I'm taking this light color right here called soft light and I'm
3:06just gonna be applying this into my crease and just basically using this as
3:09my transition shade just buffing it all over my face
3:14then I'm going to take the purple in the palette called violet and on a flat
3:20shader brush i'm just going to apply this all over my lid all the way up to
3:23the crease and then going to be taking a mac 217 and just blending out those
3:29harsh edges and bringing that color up into my crease a little bit
3:34next I'm going to take this urban decay eyeliner in the color binge and i'm
3:40going to apply this to my waterline and my tight line as well
3:45next I'm going to this navy blue shade called midnight and on my mac 217 i'm
3:50going to start building this color up slowly packing it onto the outer view of
3:54my eye and then dragging it into the crease i'm going to be doing this over
3:59and over again until i get the desired shade that I want is just a lot of
4:03building up and blending so just take your time with this
4:11then I'm just going to take an angled brush and dip it right into that
4:14midnight color and kind of use this as an eyeliner really close to my lash line
4:18just to give it a little bit more dimension and make it look a little bit
4:21more smoky and deep since i'm not going to be using liquid liner that is what
4:27i'm doing i'm going to take the black in this palette and I'm just gonna pack
4:31this on the outer view of my I really focusing it on the outer V just keep it
4:36up a little bit and make it more smoky i'm just going to pack that on and then
4:42start dragging it towards the center of my eye just to blend out the little
4:45harsh line
4:54next I'm going to dip my fluffy brush into the color violet and i'm just going
5:01to start blending out all the harsh lines and really just blowing everything
5:05out and kind of defusing the colors i really want the purple to stand out in
5:09the crease so I'm just packing this on doing windshield wiper motions and just
5:12pulling out the look I'm going to move onto the resume face before I finish up
5:19my eyes and I am just going to prime my face using the Maybelline Baby skin
5:24instant port eraser and the foundation I'm using is my l'oreal true match in
5:31the shade and three natural buff and I am just using a makeup brush to apply it
5:42yeah

6:10shade 15 fair and i'm just going to draw a little triangle underneath my eyes to
6:15cover up my dark circles and to highlight as well and for more
6:18highlighting I'm just gonna run that down the bridge of my nose in between my
6:22eyebrows a little bit on my forehead on my Cupid's bow and on my chin as well to
6:35blend that out and just using my Real Techniques contour brush

7:16palette and I'm going to use this to highlight underneath my brow bone and
7:24then i'm going to be taking the transforming pearl shade and I'm just
7:28gonna be adding some of that right on top just to give it a little bit more
7:31shimmer because this is a very matte look and then I'm going to add some in
7:36my inner tear duct as well i'm gonna take that midnight color and on the
7:40pencil brush i'm just going to buff this underneath my lower lash line just to

8:53sorry that I've been off my game but I will be back and better than ever
8:57very soon thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't
9:00already and I'll see you next time
0:11yes so today's video is going to be a drugstore back to school makeup tutorial
0:18this is the kind of makeup I would wear to high school and it's using none other
0:23than drugstore products and i'm also using affordable brushes as well
0:27it's a talk through video yeah
0:30so you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching ok so I've
0:33already done my eyebrows and i used the NYX micro brow pencil and brunette and I
0:39said it with the loreal brow stylist plumper in light to medium but I really
0:45natural with my eyebrows today if you guys watch my videos you know you
0:48you know I like a bold brow but I went I just followed the exact natural shape of
0:53my eyebrow to fill in any of the sparse areas i have a little bit of bald spots
0:57in between so i used these two products these are the best drugstore products
1:02for the eyebrows
1:03I do think that no matter what I have to fill my eyebrows and even if i'm not
1:07putting on makeup on the rest of my face
1:09I have to do my eyebrows so that is what I did to get started on my makeup
1:15i am going to get my hair on my face
1:18i bought this specifically for my tutorials
1:22our little hearts but to me it looks like a little bear like little bear ears
1:26oh I just hate having my hair my face when I do tutorials so
1:31ok so I'm going to start off with my face when I went to high school I've
1:34said this about a million times but I didn't start wearing makeup until I
1:38graduated high school till I was 18
1:40like actual makeup in high school I literally had the same routine every day
1:45I put on a brown eyeliner or black depending on how i felt that it huh
1:50brown or black eyeliner on my waterline mascara and lipstick those three things
1:55and that's simply because i didn't like to wear makeup that much in high school
2:00I didn't really get obsessed with it till I after I graduated and I could not
2:04be bothered in the morning
2:05my mom had to like force me out of it even as a senior in high school she was
2:09like like
2:10get up I was one-hundred-percent not a morning person so i did my makeup while
2:16my mom drove me to school every morning and it was only three things so I got it
2:20done really fast but if I had to go back to high school right now
2:23this is probably the kind of makeup I where I still wouldn't wear foundation
2:27I would probably only put concealer on the certain areas that i need concealing
2:31but today i'm going to be using my Maybelline Dream pure BB cream
2:36I love this BB cream is my favorite one from the drugstore it has salicylic act
2:40acted it has salicylic acid acne treatment in it which I find doesn't
2:47really help my skin but it doesn't break me out so I'm all for that i'm using my
2:50Real Techniques sculpting brush and I am just putting that on your face
2:56this is in the shade light to medium sized very very sheer coverage but on me
3:02it doesn't get greasy throughout the day it doesn't get disgusting
3:06if I'm going to be completely honest with you i would recommend something
3:11with SPF I don't think this has SPF especially if you have PE or anything
3:16like that it's smarter to use a product with SPF in it
3:22so if you are going to use this product just put on a moisturizer that
3:25has SPF on first and then going with this
3:29that is what I would do
3:33i'm loving one by tasha at the moment and that is not drug store so I'm not
3:38including it so everyone wakes up really really early to go to school and well
3:45we've got some dark circles folks and we need to cover those bad boys up i'm
3:49going to use the Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser this has
3:54really good coverage but it's really light so i like it underneath the eyes
3:58I have mine in the shade fair and i'm not going to highlight or anything
4:02I'm just gonna dab this underneath my eyes on my dark circles and i'm just
4:08going to blend that out
4:10i'm also going to bring that on to my eyelid to help cover up the veins I have
4:15very veiny eyelids so this is going to help cover them up
4:20conceal it
4:22you could even use your fingers if you don't have makeup brushes just that this
4:25into your under eyes with your fingers
4:30oh great there's a man with a leaf blower ok so let's ignore the leaf
4:35blower really quick
4:37I have to set my under eye concealer no matter what I don't set the rest of my
4:41face with powder because i have dry skin if you have oily skin even normal skin
4:48i do recommend setting your face political last all those are words you
4:52are in school system and I can see I'm using the elf high definition under I
4:56setting powder I lost this and i finally found it
4:58it's one of the best under I setting powders and his life three dollars very
5:03brightening i really like it
5:05using the Real Techniques setting brush
5:23now my face seems a little bit washed out a little bit just like flat there's
5:26not much to it so i'm going to bronze the skin and I'm going to use my ELF
5:31pressed mineral bronzer in 10 toffee
5:33this is a great affordable bronzer I'm taking this real techniques that that
5:38blush brush and I'm just going to warm up the face
5:43I know that contours all the rage right now and all that stuff but guys please
5:52don't feel like you have to contour to go to school please don't feel like that
5:55please don't feel like you need to look like cut production and in fourth period
5:58because you don't I feel like people have this expectation that you have to
6:05look super makeup you all the time and that is not true i mean my eye bags were
6:10on fleek in high school and I never completed them yellow
6:14I didn't have time for that but on the flip side
6:17do not let anybody make you feel like you cannot wear a smoky eye to school if
6:21you want to wear a little smoky eye to school if you want to highlight your
6:25face
6:26put on five layers of foundation if you want to wear that to school do not let
6:29anybody anybody make you feel like you shouldn't
6:32it's just makeup and washes off at the end of the day and if you want to go ham
6:36go ham if you want to not wear makeup
6:39don't wear makeup who cares society these days
6:44um this makeup tutorial specifically is what I would wear to high school
6:50personally so that is why I'm doing it this way because it's what i would do
6:54and it's my tutorial you know
6:56ok now that I don't feel like a zombie anymore all hail bronzer
7:00I love me some bronzer i am going to add a little bit of that same bronzer in the
7:05crease of my eye
7:06I would never have done eyeshadow for high school because I did not have time
7:11for that I love getting my extra 10 minutes of sleep
7:14so just dusting bronzer in the crease will make a world of a difference
7:18it looks like you put a little something something when really it's just a little
7:22bit of runs are you know I feel like doing eyeshadow takes a lot of time and
7:29you have to concentrate and all that stuff so I just messily so that bronzer
7:35in my crease and call it a day
7:36now i'm just using this cultural sense brush to get that same bronzer and just
7:44a little bit underneath my lashes my lower lashes
7:47now i am completely done with my eyes just a little bit of definition and now
7:53i'm going to use the Maybelline lash sensational mascara i love this one
7:57because it gives me a lot of volume and I love having thick lashes no matter
8:01what I do so I'm just going to add just too thin coats of this to my top and
8:06bottom lashes
8:07next I'm going to define the eyes just a little bit of eyeliner on my lower lash
8:13line i'm not going to tight line or anything i'm using the gel pencil liner
8:17by NYX in brown I just think it's a little bit less harsh than black
8:25and then that completes the i zoomed in a little bit just so you can see this is
8:31just a little bit of bronzer in the crease mascara and brown eyeliner
8:36ok so normally at this point i would just throw on some lip gloss lipstick
8:40whatever whatever
8:41lip liner but i am going to apply and need to be of bullish just a little bit
8:45of blush because i know some people like cannot go without blush I'm somebody who
8:49I rather just do bronzer and that's it
8:52some people rather do blush and skip bronzer but i'm just going to add a
8:57little bit of this Milani baked blush in luminaux so because it does have a sheen
9:03to it and I cannot be bothered to highlight to go to school cos hour so
9:07i'm just adding a little bit of Luminoso could create a soft glow to my skin
9:17you see and this way it looks like you highlighted because of the Machine and
9:24the blush
9:25let's have didn't ok and to finish off the look i really recommend something
9:29like this
9:29this is the alpha moisturizing lipstick in the shade in the nude it's more of a
9:34darker a little bit more of a brown dude but it is a sheer lipstick and they're
9:39very very moisturizing it almost feels like a lip balm
9:42so i recommend something like this because it's really easy to throw in
9:45your book bag or to settle in your purse and just reapply throughout the day
9:49without even using a mirror because it's foolproof
9:52since it is so shear and hydrating it's not something that you need a lip liner
9:55with it's not something you need a mirror with so i am just putting this on
9:59and what I love most about this lipstick is that eventually it just dries down to
10:07a mat kind of finish but it isn't uncomfortable it's not mad it feels
10:12hydrating but it's not glossy and I like that
10:15if this lip color is too dark for you go with something a little bit pinky or a
10:19little bit of each year or more natural clear gloss whatever you feel
10:22comfortable with that complete this back to school makeup look I really hope you
10:26guys enjoyed it leave me a comment down below if you actually are excited to go
10:30back to school or if you already started school I might be late on this tutorial
10:33but anyway I love you guys thank you so much for watching please subscribe if
10:37you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:24hey guys so today's video is a tutorial on this look around her
0:31it's using the jack on her favorites palette a tutorial using this palette
0:36has been requested
0:38since i reviewed it and during the move
0:41I lost it I lost this and like five other pilots had a little meltdown
0:46thought they were gone for good and i finally found this in a box of stuff
0:50that I had not opened yet which is weird because i remember correctly makeup in
0:54that box but anyway obviously this isn't a very like natural like makeup look I
1:00thought it would be fun to play around with some glitter like on the lash line
1:04and just to use like Pink's on the lid i used mainly like these colors right here
1:10and this really pretty coral so yes this is the local game of wii i'm french now
1:17hope you enjoy this video and I don't know why I'm wearing this shirt this
1:20shirt totally doesn't go with this look but honestly didn't know what I was
1:24doing I was it was just the shirt I was wearing hashtag lazy if you want to see
1:29how to get this look then just keep on watching
1:31ok so i've already primed my lids and I'm taking this color right here in the
1:36palette and I'm applying this color into my crease as my transition shade now all
1:42of these colors have like individual numbering but it doesn't show up on the
1:46actual palette so i will leave a link down below of the shades i use that like
1:49the numbers that correspond to each shadow i will leave it all in the
1:53description box so now i'm taking this really pretty pinky cranberry shade and
1:59on a flat shader brush i'm applying this to my entire lid
2:03I'm grabbing my fixed plus and I'm spring my brush giving it back into that
2:11eyeshadow and plopping you're right back onto my eyelid to just intensify that
2:15color even more now I'm going to take this really beautiful coral shade and
2:21i'm going to apply this into my crease with a little fluffy brush i actually
2:26got this brush in my Ipsy bag that video will go up after this video sorry it's
2:30taken me so long to post but yeah it's a really nice little blending branch and
2:34i'm just applying that everywhere in my crease I'm taking these two shades one
2:39is a more pinky champagne and the other one is more gold and i'm using that to
2:43highlight my brow bone and then this shade right here take a really pretty
2:47pink iridescent I don't know it's beautiful and on my flat shader brush
2:52I'm just popping that right into the center of the lid just so that like it
2:56looks like the light catches the center of the eyeball if that makes it so okay
3:00really quickly I'm going to my face
3:02ok this is the hourglass primer serum and this has changed the game for me I
3:09want you guys to see how this makes my skin look I do not recommend this for
3:12anybody except super super super dry skin because it's pretty much like an
3:17oil for your face but matte foundation lies beautifully on top of it for me I
3:22couldn't use like matte foundation so much before but it's amazing as you can
3:27tell by my face i really love it so on top of that i'm using it the maybelline
3:31fit me foundation in 120 I'm just darling that on my entire face
3:40of course danny has to you know interrupt
3:45he works all day in the Sun so he's like a different color so I'm blending that
3:50into my skin with my makeup
3:53oh excuse me with my makeup geek stippling brush that conversation
3:58stippling brush i love this is the best brush for foundation and I'm just loving
4:03that right into the skin im using the urban decay and naked in concealer this
4:09is in light no this isn't fair neutral i keep forgetting the name but it's in
4:13fair neutral and i'm applying that underneath my eyes and just highlighting
4:16the rest of my face
4:17honestly I can't like I can't use any other concealer recently because this
4:22concealer is the best out there i'm also going to use that concealer to like
4:26sharpen the eyeshadow event and yeah I just wanted you guys have seen me to
4:31that a million times so i just get that but I'm taking this yellow powder in the
4:36Knicks contour kit and i'm using not to set my under eye concealer it's kind of
4:40like their banana shade that's what it's called
4:43so yes this is an elk brush I used to set it i'm taking this mr. right now
4:49eyeliner by the ball i'll leave the shade name below but it's a really
4:53pretty gray and i just put that on my waterline and my tight line as well then
4:58I'm taking this beautiful matte purple and i am putting this on my lower lash
5:03line with a pencil brush it's such a pretty purple i love it
5:09then I'm just going to drag that purple look it's getting hard to explain but
5:14you can see what I'm doing I'm just dragging the line upwards so it can
5:17match like the top of my eyelid you know I'm saying yeah back into this crocheted
5:24with that same pencil brush I'm just blending that purple out a little bit so
5:28that all the colors can like flow together and match to highlight my inner
5:33corners i'm just using the same two shades i used to highlight my brow bone
5:37now I'm taking this lit cosmetics glitter it's amazing and the lit
5:43cosmetics adhesive and here i'm showing you the glitter i'll be hoping it
5:48doesn't fall everywhere but it's such a pretty red with like a bunch of pink
5:51little I don't know it's really beautiful
5:53this is a tart brush exactly sure that name but it's like their eyeliner brush
5:58and I'm just applying this really really close to my upper lash line just like it
6:02was liquid liner you know like a typical black liquid liner i'm doing that just
6:07with glitter instead and I really kotor now it's just a little touch you can
6:11only tell when your eyes are closed but it's really pretty i like it so I'm
6:15packing on the mascara to my top and lower lashes as well this is the clinic
6:20bottom lash and then i'm applying some demi wispies to my eyelashes and that
6:25completes the eyes so moving on to the rest of the face i'm taking the cooler
6:29toned contouring powder in the Knicks contour kit and i'm using this to just
6:34hollow out my cheekbones and to contour you know because its contract
6:40yeah
6:48and then to just warm up my skin just a little i'm taking the physicians formula
6:55bronze booster bronzer with my Sigma duo fiber brush almost forgot the name and
7:01i'm just adding a little bit of warmth to the face for blush I'm using the NYX
7:05blush in the shade mom it looks so pretty like with any look and since the
7:10eyes are so like BAM and colorful I wanted to go pretty light on the blush
7:14and for the highlight I'm using one by NARS it's so it's a blush but it is not
7:22a bullish it's called reckless and at first I didn't like this because it has
7:25a little bit of glitter in it but it is really really pretty what supplied to
7:29the cheeks I don't know for some reason it's not showing up on camera but it's
7:32pretty intense and I like it and I'm using a real techniques i shadow brush
7:36so to finish up the look i'm using the fergie daily lipstick by wooden wild and
7:42then that completes take a look
7:44thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
7:46and I will see you in my next video
0:00hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look it is
0:06using the two-faced sweet peach palette it's been so highly requested to do my
0:11favorite look with this palette and this is pretty much it
0:14it's very similar to the look I did in my no mirror makeup challenge is
0:18obviously much better because i had a mirror and I really really love it very
0:23warm and summary and fresh
0:26so if you want to see how to get this look then let's just you know get
0:29started
0:30so I've already primed my eyes and I have applied some eyeshadow to set down
0:34that primer
0:35I'm gonna go straight into the sweet fish palette and the first color but I
0:39take is Georgia it's a really pretty peachy pink color and I'm taking this on
0:43a fluffy blending brush applying this into my crease i'm using this color as
0:47my transition shade so all the colors can kind of blend seamlessly
0:51I'm sorry this is like out of focus here but I'm taking it the brown shade in the
0:54palette this is called puree
0:56it's a very very warm peachy orange e brown
1:01I love it so I'm just packing this on the outer corners and drag me into my
1:05crease
1:06I'm going to take the shadow luscious while i like to call it touches
1:10I'm taking the lunches color and i'm applying this on my entire lid using a
1:14flat shader brush
1:15I want this color everywhere like I want it all to be shimmery and then I'm going
1:19to take summer
1:20yum and I'm going to buff that on the outer corners and drag that into my
1:24crease as well
1:25the same thing I did with puree only adding a little bit more depth and
1:29warmth that i took a brush that was a little more dense this one is from
1:32coastal sense it's just like a flat shader brush and I'm packing that summer
1:36young color on the outer corners and then slowly dragged me into the crease
1:41I want any more precise brush to apply more product and then I just took
1:45Georgia to blend all that out to highlight underneath my brow bone i just
1:49took the white shade in the palette my eyebrows are on fire i need to get them
1:53done and then I just took luscious again and applied some more just in case some
1:57of it got blend
1:58no way and now i'm mixing luscious with the white shade and i'm applying that in
2:02my inner corners
2:04ok so starting on my face I'm taking the Knicks born to glow illuminating primer
2:08and then i'm going in with my she sado synchro skin foundation
2:12i'm applying the foundation with my pure sponge i have been loving this
2:16foundation it gives you really good coverage and it just looks really nice
2:20on the skin like it lasts a long time
2:22I'm totally into it lovin it so i'm just applying on my entire face i'm speeding
2:27through this part because you've seen it a million times
2:29now i'm taking my lasting perfection concealer by the brand collection
2:34I got this concealer on amazon I've done a lot of questions where I got it I got
2:37on Amazon because i'm pretty sure we cannot get this in the States so I found
2:42it on amazon
2:43I'm just blending that in with my sponge once again
2:51now i'm going to set down that concealer i'm using my NYC smooth skin translucent
2:57loose powder and I'm just gonna set my under eye concealer with this
3:01this is actually a really great powder it doesn't look powdery on my dry skin
3:05and it was insanely affordable pretty good i'm going to say breathe to break
3:09the mood so I'm going to finish off my eyes I'm going to take my NYX brown
3:15eyeliner my towards your Lee eyeliner in brown and i'm going to tight line and
3:19add that to my waterline as well then I'm going to take some are young and on
3:22a pencil brush I'm just gonna buff that on my lower lash line and then this is
3:31the part where i got really frustrating for some reason i could not do a wing
3:34today like oh my gosh i'm using the ardency Inn punker eyeliner in black and
3:39okay yeah I'm totally out of the frame here this is usually what ends up
3:42happening when i try to do some liquid liner I don't notice i'm out of the
3:46frame
3:47I was so frustrated because it didn't turn out so good but I took my jordana
3:50best / extreme applied that to my lashes and then i went in with some ardell
3:55falsies these are these soft touch for c's and then that completes the eyes a
4:00little bit struggle struggle had a little bit of trouble with that wing but
4:04we survived
4:05so now i'm going in with this NARS duo it's the hot sand and laguna duo
4:10so I'm just taking the Laguna bronzer on this mac brushes like a flat paddle
4:15brush and I'm kind of contouring and bronzing the skin at the same time
4:20this bronzer can do both i feel like it can contour but bronze you up very well
4:24I really really really love this bronzer I'm just bronzing up the skin
4:28now i'm going in with blush this is the to face sweetheart blush in the shade is
4:33sparkling Bellini
4:35I'm kind of focusing my brush on the top two shades not so much like the dark
4:38pink and I'm just popping that on the cheeks it gives you a really pretty
4:43orangi pinky glow and for highlight i'm just going to take the hots and
4:46highlight that's in this duo
4:49i'm applying this with my morphe m310 brush a nice little fan
4:53brush and then i apply some setting spray this is the wet and wild setting
4:57spray and I have popped up on my entire face and then went in with my highlight
5:01again just to intensify it doing this little trick really does intensify your
5:05highlight
5:06it's amazing and then i went in with a different brush to highlight my nose
5:10I don't know why I don't know what I did
5:13so yes and to finish off the look of warning of my lip color this is a fancy
5:17by color pop but I didn't want something so intense i wanted like a milky version
5:21of a coral so I just blend that out with my finger and then i went with this tarp
5:25lip gloss in the shade hella and just put that on top and blended that in and
5:30I really liked how it looked that's like a glossy pinky coral but it's a little
5:34bit more natural and that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching
5:38please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here
0:13it's very simple it's mainly focused on my skin there's something about spring
0:17and summer that I just love looking extra doing extra glowy as if the Sun
0:23and the weather
0:26naturally made my skin look that way but it was makeup is very minimal and fresh
0:31but it is still a full face of makeup just on the natural looking side
0:35i love it i feel like i can wear my makeup like this every single day and I
0:38would be okay with it just changing up my lip color and my eyeliner and I'd be
0:41set so if you want to see how to get this really dewy skin and make up
0:47I guess just keep watching so the first thing I'm going to do is take my hair in
0:51my face
0:52as per year ish already filled in my eyebrows and i use the colour-pop brow
0:57pencil in dope dope
1:00the reason I'm mentioning this is because I've been a lot of questions
1:02from you guys asking if I like it or not and I'm still on the fence with these
1:07color pop brow pencils I like them but I don't love them like i like my honest
1:12hacia one more but this is so affordable at the same time it's like it's awesome
1:16but it's not as waxy as I would like it to be but I used it today and i've been
1:21using it i like it it's just not my favorite to prime my face i'm going to
1:24use the glossy a priming moisturizer
1:27I really really like this reminds me a lot of my Too Faced hangover primer but
1:31it's even more moisturizing if that's possible
1:34it doesn't smell as good as that one but it is very hydrating and it has that
1:38same kind of consistency as well
1:40now usually on a day to day basis I don't apply foundation but this is like
1:46a full-blown makeup tutorial like I'm doing the whole shebang
1:48but today i'm going to be using the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
1:51I'm going to be mixing it with an oil this is from the blissful body
1:55it's an etsy shop bless my body makes one of my favorite body moisturizers
2:01but you can use any oil you have argan oil holy oil any oil you have this has
2:05like a bunch of different oils in it going to add a pump of this to the back
2:08of my hand I'm in the shade porcelain and then I'm just going to take a very
2:14little amount of this apply to little drops to the back of my hand and mix
2:22that
2:27I'm going to take the elf ultimate blending brush to buff that in before I
2:41apply some concealer i'm going to add some of this guy i just recently
2:44purchased this and i have been loving this
2:47this is the marc jacobs spotlight glow stick pretty much looks like go dormant
2:52you know and honestly the packaging kind of throws me off a little bit
2:57i I don't know if it's marketed like to just apply straight from the thing but I
3:02don't like doing that I'm going to take the sedona least 217 brush and I'm going
3:07to apply this to the tops of my cheekbones and I'm doing this first
3:10because it is a cream product and i want to lay down all the cream products
3:14before i go over with powder
3:19ok so now i'm going to apply some under-eye concealer
3:25I'm going to use my it cosmetics bye bye under eye illumination this is like a
3:29newer concealer i purchased mine either on the it cosmetics website or ultimate
3:33pretty sure I got this on the website if you are familiar with the bye bye under
3:37eye it's pretty much the exact same thing only it's a little bit more
3:40illuminating just going to apply very little like I barely squeeze this onto
3:45my finger and then blend it in because this is really really really thick
3:53yeah
3:58now I'm just blending that in with this tiny little random key go brush face 500
4:06remember how I got this now i'm going to set the under eyes and pretty much the
4:12rest of my face with the RCA no color powder
4:17ok so now I've set my entire face and you could see that myspace is still
4:31glowy but it's not tacky anymore because I said it its own i'm going to bronze up
4:35the skin I'm just going to go ahead and finish my face before I do my eyes
4:38because i'm going to do something extremely simple on the eyes
4:41it's what I've been doing a lot recently and i'm going to use the positions
4:45before we left but a bronze you guys not available this
4:48it's one of the best bronzers I've ever tried seriously I'm going to use my
4:52zoeva looks grand powder brush number 90
4:55I love this for bronzer because it tapers and it's God's perfect i love
4:59this brush
5:05yeah
5:14some on the neck and the jawline
5:17so it's a uniform you know so that's pretty much all the bronzer i want to
5:21add I'm not trying to contour anything but i do like to rub some on my nose
5:25just so that it looks like the Sun kind of kissed my whole face for blush I'm
5:30going to go in with the wet and wild color icon blush in apricot in the
5:34middle
5:35africa in the middle actually just pick this one about walgreens like two days
5:38ago I haven't tried this one
5:45yeah
5:48this is hey multitask brush from Real Techniques this is so beautiful when
5:57it's like two to three dollars gonna take my morphe and b5 brush and just
6:02blend it all together
6:04this is quite possibly my favorite sibling brush of all time
6:08it's really good ok so i'm going to go ahead and start on my eyes because i
6:11want to show you guys a little trick that I've been doing with my highlight
6:14okay so four eyes were going very basic here very minimal
6:18I have been extremely into metallic eye liner for like the past week
6:23rose gold gold like I don't know I've just really been into it one of my
6:27favorite ones is from colour-pop it's called get paid
6:30it's like a rose gold I also love show me that one is like a bronze eagle that
6:351 i've been using a lot too but I'm just gonna tighten with this and add it to my
6:38waterline as well
6:43and then i'll just take a pencil brush and a color like really similar to the
6:47eyeliner
6:48today I'm going to use the l'oreal colour reach sunset
6:51eyeshadow and on this be 36 this is my favorite pencil brush from morphe if you
6:58ever see me using a pencil brush in my videos
7:00nine times out of 10 it's going to be the e36 i have a ten percent off more
7:04peacoat i will link it down below
7:06best pencil brush ever this is the only pencil brush that doesn't hurt my eyes I
7:11know that seems really weird but a lot of pencil brush is just scratch my eyes
7:14are going to add a little bit of this to my lower lash line and a little bit to
7:24my top lashes as well
7:26this color is very very very soft so it doesn't show up too much which I like
7:33four looks like that because i only want to define my lashline I don't really
7:36want to do like an intense look now I'm just curling my life
7:40the shoes and going in with some mascara I'm using the Kiko extra sculpt Volume
7:46Mascara coast to coast
7:49so that completes the guys you can see it's nothing special but it just gives
7:52it a little bit of a pop to the eyes
7:55oh I'm such a fool the reason why i wanted to do my eyes first and then come
8:01back to the face is because i wanted to show you my little trick but I put on
8:06mascara already
8:07usually I don't like to do this part with mascara but it's okay we can do it
8:10i'll show you in a second but first i'm going to take a little bit of the hour
8:14glass powder in luminous light
8:17this is a wet and wild stippling brush and I'm just going to applies some of
8:21this to my face to add a little bit more of a globe because we're not going
8:28enough for highlight i'm actually going to take this product right here this is
8:34the laura geller filter finish setting powder in universal
8:37it looks like it has a bunch of color correcting powders but it's pretty much
8:41like the same pearly kind of finish and this is a very soft very natural
8:47luminous powder like I don't know if you can tell it's like barely noticeable but
8:52i love it
8:54it doesn't emphasize the texture on your skin it's like a really nice soft
8:58everyday highlight but the way i like to intensify it just a little bit is I like
9:03to set my face and then apply the highlight with my face still being wet
9:09so today I'm going to use the wet and wild photo focus setting spray this is
9:12actually a great setting spray and it's like under five dollars
9:15it does make your makeup lasts all day so
9:20and i love the spray nozzle on this it's so fine and with my face still being a
9:26little bit what I'm going to take my fan brush this is the morphe and 310
9:31i'm going to highlight my cheeks
9:48this is an awesome little trick to do for those of you who feel like your
9:52highlight isn't intense enough this is awesome for you and also i feel like it
9:56makes my highlight last longer I don't know what it is
9:59I don't know if it's because i'm applying it on top of a setting spray it
10:03just makes my highlight last all day when i do it like this
10:06awesome so now i'm just gonna let that dry ok so now that my face is pretty
10:12much dry
10:13this is what my skin looks like my face is completely dry it's not tacky
10:18because I initially set it with powder and then I just continue to use powder
10:21products on top like if you saw my skin in person you would never tell I have
10:25super dry skin power make up and then to finish off this look I'm going in with a
10:29lip product this is the honest hacia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in Dolce
10:33I feel like this color is perfect for spring because it's like a nude but it's
10:38like a quarterly nude
10:39I really like it another the product i cannot get enough of is laguna beach by
10:46Oprah

0:15hey guys so today's video is a one brand tutorial featuring wet and wild I told
0:21you guys recently that i wanted to get back into these one brand tutorial and
0:25today we're using one wild
0:27it was only once I completed this look that I realized I actually have a look
0:32ridiculously similar to this already on my channel that i did not that long ago
0:37so I'm so sorry this looks very similar to a previous look but it is a full face
0:43what a wild look so i decided to just just post it anyway because i really
0:47love how my face makeup turned out and I just like how romantic the look is and
0:52since all of these products are ridiculously affordable I thought maybe
0:56it was worth a watch
0:58the one thing I will say is I love wet and wild as a brand I think they're
1:02probably one of the best drugstore brands
1:05not only in terms of quality but in terms of price but I so struggled with
1:10my eye makeup and I will go into details in the video but i use a combination of
1:14the wet and wild single eyeshadows the comfort zone palette which is probably
1:19the best when a while pilot ever
1:20and i also used this palette this is a new one wild pilot called i'm not a row
1:26and this is the rosy toned one
1:28it has a lot of reds and pinks and I do not like this palette at all i just used
1:33to of the shadows but I just didn't like them
1:37this copper one is the 1i used on my entire lid and I just pictured it
1:41completely different i have to wet it and even after waiting it wasn't enough
1:46it kind of was coming it is coming off right now i don't know if you can see it
1:50there but it was like coming off in patches which probably means this
1:53I makeup won't last that long but I still want you guys to see the whole the
1:58whole process anyway I wanted to do something very very simple because maybe
2:02you're watching this video because you just started out and makeup and wet and
2:05wild is the brand you're looking at first so this I makeup is extremely easy
2:09I just honestly would not recommend the
2:12these pallets i would go strictly for the comfort zone or any other wet and
2:16wild palette like this
2:18the only thing on my face that isn't what a wild is my mascara because I
2:21cannot find my mascara anywhere i purposely bought one for this tutorial i
2:26bought the mega lengths mascara it's in a purple tube
2:29no idea where it is can't find it anywhere but besides that everything on
2:33my face is wet and wild and I am in love with the face makeup like every face
2:38product i use today
2:40I love so much i think that's definitely where the money is at its face makeup
2:45when it comes to what a while and ridiculously cheap way cheaper than
2:48other brands at the drugstore
2:50so you don't forget to leave me a comment down below what you want my next
2:52one brand tutorial to me and i will look into it so if you want to see how to get
2:57this romantic glowy look just keep watching
3:01ok so I'm actually going to start off this tutorial with my brows i'm using
3:06the wet and wild color icon brow shaper this is just like a clear wax use that
3:11to brush my hairs and then i went in with this little ultimate brow kit in
3:15the shade ash brown probably not my perfect shade but i'm using the lightest
3:20powder in the kit and I'm just running this through my brows and just kind of
3:24shaping them the way I want them to it's kind of hard to do it with powder alone
3:28i usually like using a brow pencil and then a powder on top
3:32not just a powder by itself but I don't think it turned out horribly for being
3:36like a weird shade and
3:38yeah so I actually put the wet and wild ultimate brown mascara on top this is in
3:44the shade nothing but brunette I love this bra mascara
3:47it's really good and then i moved on to Z face
3:50this is the wet and wild color icon face primer this is a good primer it just
3:54kind of smoothes out your skin and it gives you a nice base for foundation and
3:58then i went in with the cover off that I say color icon primer
4:01I meant cover all primer and then i went in with the wet and wild cover off
4:05foundation
4:07this one is in the shade fair / light and i'm just applying that on my entire
4:12face using a real techniques sponge I broke out on my forehead after i did a
4:16photoshoot recently like broke out pretty badly on my forehead
4:21don't know what caused it either so strange i'm going to take the come
4:24correct can see they're very similar to the it cosmetics
4:27bye bye under eye it's very very thick so I'm blending it in a little bit with
4:31my finger and then to kind of make it a little bit liquid here i am mixing it in
4:36with this wet and wild
4:38highlighting pen in the shade ivory into you this is just going to make it easier
4:43to blend so i'm highlighting with this as well all over the face like a savage
4:48around my mouth
4:54it takes a while to blend this under eye concealer out but you know doing my best
5:06with the sponge
5:09i'm going to set that concealer using the wet and wild contour little duo kit
5:15thing
5:16this is in the shade duty letter and I took the light shade in the duo and i
5:19use this to set my under eye concealer and anywhere else
5:22I placed the concealer ok so now let's move on to the eyes
5:29i'm going to use this new one wild primer this is the photo focus eye
5:33primer and this is not for those of you who have really dry eyelids because it
5:39can dry out the lids just a little bit i recommend padding it in but it does make
5:43your eyeshadow last all day I took the wet and wild single eyeshadow and creme
5:48brulee and just set that primer down and I went into this out in stl palette this
5:52is the pinky tone one and i took that shade i pointed at and i'm using this
5:57kind of as a transition shade and then I wanted something a little bit more Brown
6:01in the crease so it took the comfort zone palette and i took the shade
6:05labeled crease on the left side
6:07i'm using the same brush just kind of like a nice blending crease brush and
6:11I'm buffing this into my crease as well
6:15I'm gonna take this wet and wild photo focus setting spray and i'm going to wet
6:20this one dollar elf brush and I'm going to dip it into that copper shade in that
6:25palette and I do not like this eyeshadow
6:27I definitely had to wet it because when i tried to use it dry on the other i 0
6:32pigmentation was coming off on the brush like zero it's not the best eye shadow
6:36it kind of splotches off but anyway I took a fluffy crease brush and just
6:40buffed out the edges and then to highlight underneath my brow bone
6:44I took the single shadow and sugar for my waterline i'm using the wet and wild
6:48mega last retractable eyeliner in blackest black really good eye liner but
6:53I poked myself in the eye by mistake and my eyes were a little bit right for a
6:57second there which caused the black to smudge just a little bit because my eyes
7:01were so watery
7:02I took that copper shade i used on the lid and buff that on my lower lash line
7:06and then I took the crease shade I used earlier and did the same thing I wanted
7:12a little bit more depth on the outer corner so I took the shade called
7:15definer and just focus this on the outer corners of my eyes and then i went in
7:20with this wet and wild
7:21I need something with a while this is all wet and wild ok i use the mega liner
7:25in the shade
7:26dark brown and then I highlighted my inner corners with the brow bone shaved
7:30from the comfort zone palette but I didn't record it like it did not record
7:34i'm still trying to get used to this new camera but i'm going to contour my
7:39cheeks i'm going to use that contour duo in the shade due to the letter and
7:42obviously using the contour shade
7:44I'm just chiseling my cheekbones a little and then I wanted to warm up the
7:48skin this is the color icon bronzer in the shade ticket to Brazil
7:53yes it's a nice light color but it gives your face a little bit of warmth really
7:58really pretty i love love love this bronzer so much it even has SPF i love
8:02it is great for blush I'm using the color icon blush in the shade rose
8:06champagne another favorite of mine gives you such a pretty like natural Rosie
8:11flush to the cheeks
8:13these blushes last a long time on the skin as well liked
8:16then I took the highlighting powder in the shade precious petals
8:20and i'm highlighting the tops of my cheekbones with the Real Techniques
8:23setting brush and I'm also highlighting my nose with this powder as well
8:30for my lips I just took the mega last lipstick in the shade bare it all one of
8:35the best lipsticks ever if you want a nice nude and I thought that my face
8:40looked a little bit too Matt so I went in with the photo focus setting spray
8:44but I just like drenched my skin like I super drenched
8:48but yes I give me a nice little glow that completes this video that you guys
8:52so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I
8:55will see you in my next video bye
0:22hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right
0:27now
0:27I got really really requested to do a valentines day makeup tutorial but
0:31there's just so many people uploading them right now that I don't know if I
0:36wanted to but I thought you know what I'm going to sit down and film the look
0:39that I'm going around Valentine's Day so this is what i'm going to wear
0:42it's extremely extremely easy it's like the easiest i look in the history of the
0:48world it's so easy
0:49which is why i wanted to show you guys if you are someone who is just starting
0:53out and make up or you struggle a little bit with your eyeshadow i think this
0:57video is perfect for you because anyone can do this I look absolutely anyone
1:01because i mean it is so easy and basic but I love looks like this on
1:05valentine's day i love red lips for valentine's day it's my favorite and I
1:09know that red lips are extremely typical around times a day but i like it i wink
1:15I think this makeup look is beautiful for any date night you could switch up
1:21the lip color you could literally Christmas who could honestly where any
1:27lip color with this look absolutely any so you do what you want on the lips
1:32I just love red course so if you want to get this really really simple and glowy
1:36valentines day makeup then just keep watching
1:39ok so I'm going to start off with my face and my eyes are so simple i'm
1:43taking the dr brandt pores no more i bought this because of Nicole Guerriero
1:48so I'm just trying it out and I'm going to fill in my pores with this my
1:52foundation of choice today is the lorio Leumi cushion foundation
1:56i'm going to give you guys my thoughts really quick this is such a beautiful
1:59finish on my skin but i'm in the shade w2 and it's so weird you can't tell here
2:05in this clip but it's a little bit pink which is weird since its w - it's like
2:10the strangest thing
2:11it's only a little bit pink not something that's super noticeable but
2:14yes it gives a beautiful nice like fresh finish to the skin and it has really
2:18really good coverage so i'm just applying that to my entire face
2:23for concealer i'm going to mix two of them i'm going to take my LA girl Pro
2:27concealed in the shade natural and i'm going to apply this really really close
2:31to my lashes because my dark circles were pretty bad and this shade in
2:36natural has like a really pretty peachy undertone so for the rest of my face
2:41like to highlight
2:42I'm gonna take the bareMinerals stroke of light in the shade luminous - it's
2:47basically just like a highlighting concealer and I don't know if I like it
2:51kind of kicked up on top of this foundation
2:54I'm still going to give it another try because I've never tried it on top of
2:57another foundation because this was literally the first time I used that
3:01stroke of light thing but I was like looking in the mirror and it just seemed
3:05pretty key and I know it wasn't my la girl concealer because that's like a
3:09Holy Grail consider of mine so i don't know if it was the combination of this
3:13foundation and the bareMinerals thing but it's not my favorite so far
3:17ok so i'm setting my face or my under eye concealer with of course my trusty
3:22RC may know color powder and this is going to help my concealer from creasing
3:27so i'm going to go ahead and do my eyes I'm going to take my Smashbox 24-hour
3:32eye primer and apply that to my entire lid and then I'm going to take this
3:36milani almondy cream crayon stick thing and i'm going to apply this to my whole
3:40lid just so that to my whole with that sounded weird
3:44just so that i can cover up all the veins and stuff ok so the palette i'm
3:48going to be working with is the two faced natural matte palette i'm going to
3:52take the shade heaven and i'm going to set that base i put down and now i'm
3:56taking the shade new tea and I'm bluffing that on the outer corners of my
4:01eye with a nice fluffy brush and I'm just packing this on the outer corners
4:06just so that it shows up a little bit since it's a little bit light
4:09I'm just packing that on fucking it out and then i'm going to start blending
4:12this into my crease and
4:14is pretty much the only shadow we're putting on the lid just so that I can
4:18have a little bit of dimension in my crease that i'm going to highlight
4:24underneath my brow bone with the shade heaven the 1i use first and i'm also
4:28applying that to my inner corners as well
4:32ok so I'm going to takes expresso sex presso I find that so hard to say it's
4:37like a tongue twister
4:38I don't know and I'm taking this on a flat definer brush and I'm just applying
4:43this really really close to my lower lashes and really really close to my top
4:47lashes kind of acting like a nice brown eyeliner but I mean we're going to go
4:52over it here in a second
4:54so I'm going back into new tea and I'm just buffing that on my lower lash line
4:59you know nothing fancy same applies to my shadow there and I'm going to take a
5:03black eyeshadow this is what a wild Panther eyeshadow it's literally like a
5:08dollar and it's super black but I'm taking this on an angled brush this
5:12brush is from sigma and I'm just pretending like if it's a gel liner and
5:18i'm creating a really soft messy type of wing i really like doing these looks
5:23especially if you have a hard time with gel or liquid liner
5:26this gives you the illusion of a wing but it's much softer and I just think
5:31it's really pretty so that's what I'm doing I'm just creating a nice little
5:34wing as usual like you would do with any liner and it just looks softer
5:38I don't know I like it and then I just kind of extended the tail a little bit
5:42so it looks nice and long and then we're pretty much done with that wing it was
5:47so easy so I'm taking casual your bunny and I'm just buffing that on my lower
5:51lashes just to give a little bit more depth
5:53I wanted it to look a little bit smoky there
5:56i'm going to apply some black eyeliner on my waterline and my tight line as
6:00well this is black velvet from urban decay
6:05this is gonna define the eyes just a little bit more then I used my mac
6:10extended plank a black flash on my top and lower lashes and I'm letting my glue
6:14dry but I wanted to show you guys the lashes i'm using they are posh last
6:19year's posh lashes in the shade within the while in the style wispy I'm not
6:25even gonna edit that i'm just going to leave that it
6:26ok i'm taking my color pop highlight in the shade smoking whistles and applying
6:31that to the tops of my cheekbones with my finger and then I took my position
6:34for me love butter bronzer
6:41yeah
6:43that is the song I sing in my head every single time I open this bronzer because
6:49it smells like a tropical paradise but anyway i'm using this to contour because
6:55i really like the undertone and i used a Sephora Pro airbrush in this in this end
7:00up
7:00what in the number fifty-four that is the number of this brush number
7:04fifty-four
7:06I took a stippling brush and I dipped into my kiko flawless fusion bronzer I
7:11just wanted to add a little bit more warmth to my face
7:14so i'm just applying this all over my face and then I had to change my Spotify
7:19because a really emotional song came on
7:21if you are a vampire diaries fan and if you are a Stefan fan that song hits home
7:36it was a very emotional episode anyway i'm applying Mac warms always texting me
7:41i'm applying that warm sold my face and this voiceover is a hot mess but i'm
7:47also highlighting my face with becca shimmering skin Perfector in champagne
7:52pop and i'm just using a zoeva highlighting brush to highlight my fates
7:56of course and then I forgot something in my drawers and I wanted to do a little
8:01dance but I wanted to grab my girl lactic face glow in the shade natural
8:07because I wanted to be extra Khloe so I took my real techniques blush brush and
8:13I'm just pretty much applying this face glow all over my face just to be extra
8:18glowy
8:19ok so to finish off the look I'm going in with a red lip
8:23this is a mac pro longwear lip liner in the shade he said he said she said
8:29why is that hard for me to say i don't know but while I singing to selena gomez
8:35i am going to apply my Milania more matte lip cream in the shade desire
8:40it's a liquid lipstick and i love it so that completes this makeup tutorial i
8:45hope you guys enjoyed it this is what I'll be wearing on Valentine's Day

8:52will see you in my next video bye
0:00ok so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here actually
0:14ok so a while ago I posted this picture on Instagram and I did my random
0:22favourites like um was it a month ago or two months ago already and I was wearing
0:26this exact makeup it was that same day and I got so many requests to do with
0:31the look I was wearing in that video and in this picture and for some reason I
0:35just forgot about it and never did it
0:37but then as the day's kept going on i noticed that every single day it was
0:41still being requested like I kept getting questions like what are you
0:45gonna do that tutorial using those away vako blend palette I get questions every
0:48single day so I'm so sorry that this video is going up so late I should have
0:51done this like a month ago but it is a tutorial using the soil tobacco blend
0:56palette if I'm gonna be completely honest with you I didn't want to post
0:58this
0:59I'm totally serious i wasn't going to because I mean this looks so similar to
1:04looks like hub
1:05i have already done even my own estas the one that i did recently looks a
1:09little bit like this but I don't ever want you guys to feel like I'm not
1:12listening to you and I'm not putting out videos that are being requested this is
1:16rose for you guys who wanted to see it I mean it is a little different because I
1:20normally would pair it with a nude but i love this lip with this look at the same
1:25lip i was wearing in that video the eyes are a little bit different because i
1:28don't exactly remember how i did it to be completely honest with you I don't
1:32really remember so I just you know winged it and it's kind of it's a very
1:37very very very simple makeup look
1:39it's a little bit messy like it's just like shimmer everywhere it's not very
1:44precise and very neat which i really like it gives it like a boho vibe and
1:47very summery
1:48I really hope you guys enjoy this makeup look at

1:24them as makeup finishers and they really make your makeup lasts all day
1:30this is actually one that i purchased myself this one was sent by Scandinavia
1:33but this one I purchase myself when if you guys are my i'm at all like my old
1:38i'm at all i bought it while i was at IMATS and I take this with me every
1:42single time I travel you guys don't seem to use some my channel at all but every
1:45time I go to Miami or California this bad boy comes with me because it works
1:50and honestly when I do tutorials on my channel I'm usually just home and i'll
1:54wear that make up for the rest of the day but i don't really need it to last
1:57all day because nine times out of ten
2:00I stay home I don't do anything ever
2:05um so I don't really show you guys me putting on like finishing spray because
2:09I even spray like setting sprays when i'm done with my makeup but i never do
2:13it in my videos because I just don't think about it
2:16so actually the story behind Scandinavia is really really cool
2:20the founder of skin the Navy actually came up with the idea to make these
2:25products is fairly new but came up with the idea to make like a finishing spray
2:29when he was in Miami like nightclubs in Miami had I live in Miami I'm from Miami
2:36but it's kind of funny to hear that story because he noticed that girl's
2:42makeup like in the nightclub like at the end of the night
2:44their makeup look like it was kind of like melting off like just sweating off
2:49which is understandable it's a nightclub
2:51I get sweaty in there I here I've actually never been to a club side note
2:54never ever been to a club in my life and I'm 23
2:57anyway so he would go to Miami nightclubs and he would notice that make
3:01up on women when was not really lasting and it was just melting off so he
3:05thought of the idea to create his own line of makeup finishing sprays and you
3:11guys know people swear by scandinavia and they're actually a very very good
3:16brand in the Navy actually uses like temperature control technology i don't
3:20know how they do what they do which makes your makeup lasts all day and heat
3:25or humidity
3:26because it's just it's just made to control the oils that shine through the
3:30primer I'm not going to lie this is best for normal to oily get normal
3:35combination to oily skin i have dry skin and i still use this but i only use this
3:40when I know I need my makeup to last all day
3:44this is silicone free by the way and it won't clog your pores sometimes silicon
3:48can clog your pores a little bit
3:50so yeah a friend along i'm going to leave a link down below where you can

4:36then just keep watching ok so i have already started out with moisturizer on
4:42my face
4:43now i'm going to use the scandinavian makeup primer spray
4:47so you want to make sure that when you spray this you're pretty far away you
4:50don't want to spray it like right here because you just have like a big blob of
4:53you wet mess
4:55Bobby witness moving on to foundation
5:03i love using my revlon colorstay foundation
5:07honestly it's probably the one that lasts most on my face
5:11aside from the makeup on her face and body this one is like glue as well but
5:16it's kind of luminous and lightweight lightweight lightweight i use the one
5:21that's for normal to dry skin for obvious reasons but if you have really
5:26oily skin
5:27I would use just the regular one and i'm just going to get a little bit bizarre
5:30it's a little bit song so I'm just going to mix it in I'm just gonna be like a
5:33hair just the hair of my 150 this foundation
5:38it's really full coverage so I like it when I'm going out to places and it does
5:46have SPF 15 but I don't think it looks bad and photography
5:51like sometimes foundations will give a really like gross flashback but I really
5:56don't think that this one does for concealers when I want a bulletproof
6:01concealer look I have to that I really love that is the urban decay naked skin
6:06concealer or the mac pro longwear concealer these two
6:10once they said they go nowhere a drive down to like a mat natural finish
6:15it's not do its not cakey and it doesn't fade throughout the day these concealers
6:20are the best
6:21today I'm going to use the pro longwear and nw20 going to use the Real
6:25Techniques contour brush to apply that underneath my eyes
6:37and usually like on a day-to-day basis
6:40I will just drag this up onto my eyelids and use this as my eyeshadow primer but
6:48i'm not going to do that today because when I want my makeup to last my eye
6:51makeup to last all day
6:53I like to go in with an actual eyelid primer because that works a little bit
6:59better
7:01ok so you guys know i don't typically set my face because my skin is so dry
7:06for the sake of this video i am going to set my face and especially if you have
7:11normal to oily skin you want to set your face even if you have dry skin
7:16it's just going to prolong the wear makeup i'm using my Rimmel stay matte
7:20long-lasting a pressed powder in translucent i'm going to set my
7:25concealer with this and set the rest of my face
7:29just a little bit with this powder I don't find it to be very very
7:32translucent like it's a little bit white but if you use it gently it serves its
7:37purpose
7:37I actually really like it i'm going to go ahead and move on to my eyes really
7:43quick before i finish the rest of my face
7:46ok so for my eyes I find because my eyelids are so dry that a lot of eye
7:52shadow like last a really long time but sometimes it's a little tricky when you
7:58have oily eyelids for your makeup to last all day on the eyes
8:01I have found the best primer for that is the NARS smudge-proof eyeshadow base
8:07this will not let any of your eyeshadow to crease so your eye shadow will stay
8:12intact
8:13the entire days kind of scary
8:18if you really want to take the extra step i recommend using cream eyeshadows
8:23more so like mac pro longwear paint pots they called prolong or just regular
8:31people
8:31pink Mac Paint Pots but I find that even these last longer than paint pots these
8:38are the maybelline color tattoos 24 hour cream my travels coaches so i am going
8:45to use this i'm going to use the one in chocolate sweet
8:49we're really quickly I want to apply a crease color I'm going to use the Too
8:52Faced chocolate bar palette
8:54this is a tried and true my favorite palette in the world these eyeshadows
8:57last on my eyelids and they're just fabulous
9:00so i highly recommend this palette i'm going to take this morphy e27 and dip it
9:05into this regular like brown shade
9:08we can you do it
9:19i'm doing a really really easy look for today because I want to mainly focus
9:24this look on the face makeup like how to make your face makeup lasts all day
9:30by the way i woke up today and I sound like a boy do I sound like a boy was i
9:34don't know why i don't know i am not sick
9:38I just broke woke up with like a very recipe voice today with that same brown
9:44color I'm going to take it onto my lower lash line by the way that brown color is
9:49called milk chocolate forgot to say that
9:56ok so for eyeliner you're going to want to find an eyeliner that really really
10:04holds well in your waterline whether that be a waterproof one
10:09it doesn't matter everybody's I lives are different and everybody's water line
10:12is different i feel so it's just about trial and error i would recommend trying
10:16ones that's a waterproof or like smudge proof and use those eye liners in the
10:21water line those tend to last longer
10:24this isn't waterproof but it stays a long time on my waterline
10:28this is the Knicks gel pencil liner in black and I'm just going to line my
10:33waterline with this and then a trick
10:39I always do a lot of people don't like to say that this is bad but I've never
10:43had a problem doing this a trick i always do is take I shadow and kind of
10:48set that I wonder we put down not like directly in the water line but i try to
10:54get it as close as possible to just set the cream and it lasts a lot longer so
10:59I'm going to take this dark brown color called amaretto
11:05no it's called triple fudge foot and why it's really close
11:15ok so now for the eye shadow like i said i'm going to use this color tattoo in
11:20chocolate suede
11:22this is a zueva can see their buffer brush and gonna pump pump what
11:29just gonna do this and then apply it to my lid
11:33the more product
11:45I blend out in a second
11:55yeah
12:02I'm gonna go back in with your hairless I should like a dog back into milk
12:08chocolate with this morphe brush i'm just going to blend everything out again
12:16ok so i just added a little bit more of that dark brown just to balance
12:22everything out earlier when I said I was doing a simple look I'm not easy not
12:27natural
12:28obviously i'm just going to quickly highlight with this color right here
12:34this is white chocolate and then champagne champagne champagne truffle
12:42for the inner corner then i'm applying mascara honestly just use your favorite
12:52like waterproof mascara or just your favorite mascara that you know doesn't
12:56flake throughout the day and last and holds the curl so I'm just going to
13:00apply my mailing the colossal volume and then I'll finish the rest of my face
13:03ok so now i'm going to finish off my face I'm sorry this video is so long
13:07already
13:09i'm actually going to apply a cream highlight to my cheeks first
13:14you never should put cream / powder and I already powder my face but I find that
13:19this is a really disturb
13:21what's underneath I'm going to use my cream color based in shell from mac and
13:25i'm going to apply this to my cheekbones
13:27because a really good tip on making your highlight last all day is to layer your
13:32highlights so i would suggest putting a cream underneath creams usually lasts
13:37longer and then powders and then put a powder on top to kind of set it and your
13:41highlight will stay there for a lil busy all day
13:50for contour I'm just going to quickly contour my cheekbones and really really
13:55lightly
13:56I mainly want to focus on the bronzer i'm going to use next but the contour
13:59going to use the caramel toffee wet and wild contouring palette and I'm going to
14:04use the contour side obviously just very lightly
14:08this is a morphy III just to create kind of like a shadow on my face because I
14:24really want to focus this look on some nests bronzer but this is going to just
14:30carve out the cheekbones a little bit
14:33I don't know if you can tell it just kind of gives a little bit of definition
14:36so with the same brush I'm going to bronze up my skin and when I want my
14:42brother to last all day
14:44this works this is the to face and list
14:47summer runser is a 16 hour long wear bronzer
14:52so it's supposed to last 16 hours on your skin
14:55I've never tried it for 16 hours but it does state on my face
14:59the entire day when i use it I'm just going to rub my brush in it and just
15:04bronze up my cheeks
15:08it is Matt you can go ahead and contour with this but it's a little bit
15:13it's neutral so you can control this what I just wanted to end
15:22ok so now I'm going along to blush and these are the best blushes if you want
15:28it to last all day I keep talking about all day all day but I'm a little
15:33repetitive blush is the first thing to go
15:36like when you put on your makeup at the end of the day usually you can't even
15:41see your blush like blushes the number one thing to fade on your face and on
15:46your face yes
15:46so I'm going to use the tarte amazonian clay 12-hour blush
15:51these blushes less forever on my cheeks any color works they have a huge
15:56selection of colors and i'm just going to use this one it was like the limited
16:00edition tartlet one in the shade celebrated because you know one of my
16:04eyes are dark
16:05I don't want to go like super pink just going to clean off this brush on a towel
16:10the same brush i was using and use it as a blush i'm obsessed with this brush
16:13side note
16:14morphy three if you haven't tried these 12 hour blushes
16:21they're good just going to add a little bit of color and honestly what I would
16:29recommend if you are putting on on blush and you're not going to touch up your
16:34face like if you have if you have to do your makeup and make sure that it lasts
16:38all day i recommend putting a little bit more blush than you usually would
16:42and now i'm just going to set that highlight I put down using the hourglass
16:48luminous light and i'm using this one because it's actually pretty natural and
16:51it doesn't look super frosty on the cheeks
16:58I have a lot of lip liners i am a lip liner junkie but to me the lip liners
17:04that lasts forever on my face
17:07are these la girl endless semi-permanent auto lip liner long lasting all day
17:13where they're not getting these semi permanent are like some permanent this
17:18in the shade and natural i'm just going to line my lips these are so affordable
17:21and there's so long wearing now because I don't want my lips to be this dark at
17:30all like it's too dark for this look I think you could I mean whatever i'm
17:36going to take the ELA all day liquid lipstick in the shade
17:41Rosa . and put it on top
17:44liquid lipsticks in general will be your best friend if you want your makeup to
17:48last all day and you don't want to retouch your lip product because they're
17:51like cement and they don't go anywhere so I'm gonna actually put some on my
17:55finger and blend this in
18:04if you want to throw on of lost you can just keep your gloss in your purse and
18:09we touch throughout the day since glosses don't last as long as like Matt
18:13products do so now for the most important stuff
18:16honestly I think it's even more important than the primer spray
18:19it's the finishing spray this is just going to set everything in place and
18:23make your makeup lasts all day
18:26this Scandinavia finishing spray is no joke
18:29I'm just gonna shake it spring
18:37and while that dries with my coffee
18:42it takes a minute or two to fully dry but that completes this makeup look
18:46it's nice and glowing and it will stay that way the whole day I really hope you
18:50guys enjoyed it
18:51let me know down below if you did and also so that we can all talk and all you
18:58know read each other's comments leave a comment down below what your number one
19:03bullet proof like makeup item is your number one item that you use that you're
19:07like wow this is super long wearing and i love it because it lasts all day
19:11leave it below I would love to know thank you guys so much for watching
19:13please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:21hello I look a little crazy right now because
0:24have this I semi done and this eyebrow done and I'm just like a mess right now
0:30I feel really really tired
0:32my hair is so crazy like this is actually my hair with no product in it
0:37but I really wanted to film this video so i didn't have time to do my hair and
0:41I just threw a braid on because my bangs were like out of control and I haven't
0:46even brushed my hair and I'm pretty sure that's a dreadlock
0:50so today i think i'm going to do a talk through tutorial because i haven't done
0:53one of these in a long time so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
0:57fill in my eyebrows and I don't want to do such a crazy bowl eyebrow like I
1:01usually do this might even be too bold for some people but usually I filled
1:05them in a little bit more bold you know i'm going to use the elf eyebrow kit for
1:10this
1:10it's really cheap it's three dollars and it's perfect because you get a wax and a
1:14powder perfect because the wax keeps your hair in place for a really long
1:18time and usually people go to school for like eight hours a day so that's always
1:21great
1:22I'm just going to take the wax part first and just run it through my brows
1:28i'm using a little brush i got at michaels and it cost me like two dollars
1:44after that i'm just going to dip it into the powder and go over it to set the wax
1:54browse are completely optional I just feel like it's a little bit necessary
1:58for me even though in high school and never filled in my brows
2:02never but now I feel like oh I need to fill in moments
2:08this video is probably gonna turn into like a chit chat video which i hope you
2:12guys don't mind
2:13ok so now i'm going to move on to my eyes and going to zoom you in really
2:18quick to prime my eyelids
2:20i'm going to be using this milani shadow lies in the shade
2:25almond cream this is a great pencil because it lasts all day and it does not
2:32crease and it's great because it covers up all those veins on my eyelids have
2:37crazy things there
2:38so I'm going to take it pretty far up and then just blend it out and usually
2:47in the morning if you wake up to go to school really really early your eyes can
2:50be a little bit red and tired and this just kind of masks that
2:56next I'm going to take a fluffy brush like this I got this off morphe brushes
3:01com it was under six dollars and then I'm going to take this single eyeshadow
3:05from Milani and this is called Bella cappuccino
3:08it's just a nice mapped Brown and I'm going to take this and just dust it in
3:16the crease of my eye
3:17so right here right where your eye folds
3:22I'm just going to dust that right here this is just going to give some depth to
3:26the eye
3:27give it a little bit more color
3:35now you don't have to go this far and actually do your eye makeup in high
3:39school
3:40the only thing I want on my eyes with mascara like all through high school I
3:43didn't start wearing makeup - after
3:45so this really is optional but I didn't want to do a tutorial with just mascara
3:52next I'm going to take another milani eyeshadow
3:56this one is called Bella champagne
3:59you're really pretty champagne color champagne and i'm going to take this
4:04brush from Ecotools it's just a dual ended brush I'm taking the shading part
4:09i'm going to differ at in and apply this to the lid
4:13this is just going to add some light to your eyelids so it's not all flat
4:21looking now I'm going to take this Maybelline eye studio quad
4:27I'm not sure if this was limited edition i hope not I got it pretty recently at
4:31my CVS and this is in total tease
4:34I don't think it's limited edition but i'm not exactly sure and i'm just going
4:39to take this light color right here and I'm just going to dust this right in the
4:43inner corners and this is going to make your eyes look more awake going to bring
4:47light to the center
4:49now i'm going to take this dr. Toby shade right here
4:54I'm going to dip my brush and this is a little blending brush from Ecotools and
5:00i'm just going to dust this right on the outer corners just a little bit just to
5:04give a little bit more depth but you really don't have to do this part
5:07especially if you're in a hurry in the morning
5:15then I'm just going to add this light shade again right here underneath my
5:20brow bone just to make my eyebrows look a little bit lifted
5:24i'm going to quickly move on to the rest of my face before I finish up my eyes
5:29and honestly this part is completely up to you it depends on your skin type and
5:33all that stuff if you want to go ahead and put on foundation because that's
5:36what you feel comfortable with and go ahead and put on foundation
5:39you could also use a BB cream it's a little bit less coverage and a little
5:42bit more natural
5:43BB cream is perfect for you guys in high school or anything like that
5:47I just like to go ahead and take some concealer and a bit over the places
5:51where i think i need concealing it's not just diving in with a full face of
5:54foundation so i'm going to be using my Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
5:5810 light this is my holy grail concealer
6:01it's from the drugstore and it is fantastic
6:04so i'm going to go ahead and dab it in between my eyebrows because i have a
6:07birthmark there around my nose
6:10I know I've said it a bunch of times but I have this crazy weird vain
6:17can you see it it drives me nuts and make me look like a homeless - and then
6:23a little bit on my cheeks because they get some redness on my cheeks and then
6:29I'm just going to blend this in with my buffing brush from Real Techniques
6:45I do have some self tanner on so the rest of my body is darker than my face
6:49but I will fix that up with some bronzer
6:57yeah
7:01ok so once it than that i'm going to go ahead and try to hide my dark circles as
7:04best as they can
7:06especially when going to school I know you guys wake up really really early in
7:09the morning and i remember when i was in high school my dark circles were on
7:15another level
7:16so I'm going to take my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser
7:20this is probably one of my favorite products from the drugstore to put
7:23underneath the eyes it's just really easy it's an easy application and it
7:27covers pretty well so i'm just going to dub that underneath my ass
7:41I don't know if i set up but it's in the shade I have it in the shade fair and
7:46then blending that in with my Real Techniques contour brush
8:02now i have really really dry skin so i usually do not set the foundation or
8:08concealer on my face
8:10unless it's like a really do a foundation but this concealer I don't
8:13find that I need to set it on my face
8:15so I'm only going to set my under eye concealer because if I don't set that it
8:19will crease like crazy but if you have oily skin
8:22I definitely suggest setting your face with a powder because you're going to be
8:25at school for a long period of time
8:27so you want to make sure that nothing slips off or you don't get oily or
8:31greasy throughout the day so I'm just going to go ahead and set my under eye
8:33concealer i am using my fit me powder in the shade 135 creamy natural and i'm
8:39just going to set that
8:45ok so to finish off my eyes i'm going to go ahead and take the same milani pencil
8:51i used to Prime and i'm going to add this to my waterline and what this is
8:55going to do is going to make my eyes appear larger and more a week
8:59that's going to mask that redness that my waterline tends to have in the
9:02mornings when I little smudgy brush I'm going to take this color we used earlier
9:10and I'm going to run this underneath my lashes
9:25now i'm going to apply some mascara i am using my revlon gold lacquer grow
9:30luscious mascara the first i am going to curl my eyelashes
9:36now my eyelash curler is not from the drugstore but you can go ahead and use
9:39whichever eyelash curler you own one that i recommend from the drugstore that
9:43seemed to work pretty well for me was from Revlon so i'm going to go ahead and
9:47curl my lashes and then add a few coats of this to my top and bottom lashes and
9:52I'll be right back
9:53ok so after I've applied mascara I'm pretty much done
9:57I'm going to do now is warm up my face a little bit just to give my face a little
10:03bit more life and for that I'm going to use my NYC smooth skin bronzer in the
10:08shade
10:09sunny what it looks like
10:14just swirl my brush this is a real techniques blush brush and I'm just
10:18gonna warm up my face
10:21I feel like bronzer is really important either bronzer or blush because it's
10:25just gonna make you look alive and healthy so if you don't want to use a
10:30bronzer than just add some blush to your cheeks and if you don't want to use
10:34blushed and go ahead and add a little bit of bronzer to your face
10:37you know I'm the girl who prefers bronzer over blush
10:41personally that's just me but it's all about preference and honestly I'm just
10:46warming up my face you don't need to do crazy contour anything it's just school
10:50you know it's not ideal ok now for lips are really just depends on you i wore
10:56the exact same lipstick in high school
10:58since like my sophomore year I wore max pretty please every single day in high
11:03school like that was my signature lipstick i wore it every day
11:07I've gone through like four tubes of that lipstick because I wore it every
11:10day in high school but it depends on you i recommend something like wait like a
11:14lip gloss or if you want to go ahead and use a lipstick because it's going to
11:17last longer throughout the day go ahead and do that
11:19I'm
11:20apply my NYX butter gloss in the shade eclair
11:31these are great because they're not sticky and you just throw it in your
11:36purse
11:37apply between classes ok so that is the complete makeup tutorial i really hope

0:23wearing right now and go an itch
0:27cool each i found that earlier today and then I totally forgot to film an intro
0:32for it and then I was sitting here uploading all the clips to my computer
0:37and I was like I didn't come in and throw some time doing right now and
0:41that's why I'm sitting in front of my mirror as opposed to in front of the
0:44window like I am for this entire video
0:47I warned my eyes like this and a lot of videos recently or at least something
0:52like this in a lot of recent videos
0:54the look I was wearing in my last video which was the Ipsy bag video
0:57this basically was what i was wearing on my eyes
1:00this is my goal to smokey eye this looks good on everyone on extremely fair
1:05people on extremely dark people on people with brown eyes people with blue
1:08eyes people three nice this looks good on everyone
1:11and in this video i am using a bunch of different colors for a bunch of
1:13different palettes that I have but they are very neutral colors which means
1:17they're very doable
1:18so if you're watching this and you're like really you're busting out like
1:21seven different palettes like calm down
1:23you can easily find dupes for all these eyeshadows in your collection since they
1:27are so neutral I really hope you enjoy this tutorial it was requested i posted
1:32a picture on Instagram today of me wearing this makeup and people were like
1:37tutorial
1:38well that's what I mean I was going to total regardless but yeah if you want to
1:42see how to get this makeup
1:45you know what to do
1:48so the first thing I'm going to do is prime my eyelids with the Urban Decay's
1:52primer potion
1:54next I'm taking the maybelline color tattoo in barely branded which is this
1:58really pretty
2:00champagne color
2:05yeah
2:08and I'm not going to take this past the crease
2:11I don't want any shimmery shimmer eNOS in the crease
2:16next I'm taking my naked palette and I'm using this color right here called naked
2:20excuse my nails I have not painted them yet
2:23I've just been a disaster with my nails but anyway I'm taking this color naked
2:27right here and I'm taking it on a big blending brush like this and I'm going
2:32to put this into my crease
2:47yeah
2:54now taking this color right here called shroom it's from Mac I'm going to be
2:59putting this on my entire eyelid
3:05yeah
3:07yeah
3:08yeah
3:09now taking the color of book which is just the deeper
3:14Matt Brown in The Naked palette any medium matte Brown will work and i'm
3:20just going to work this and the outer part and into my crease
3:34I'm gonna take a little bit of this color right here called smart which is
3:37just like a very very warm
3:40bronze and I'm gonna work that the same places we put book
4:04yeah
4:09and now basically all i do is just continue to build darker colors into the
4:14crease and the outer part of my eye just to make it very very deep
4:18I start from light colors too dark just because it's easier that way
4:22I'm going to take this color here called Brown down
4:25it is from mac and i'm going to be doing the exact same thing
4:37yeah
4:39and I'm going to work it directly into the socket
4:50yeah
4:53yeah
5:00now i'm taking a black matte eyeshadow this is Panther by what a while and i'm
5:06adding some more depth to the outer corner of the eye
5:09just so that it's not all brown and I'm just packing it on and brush like this
5:21and slightly blending it in
5:25yeah
5:33now i'm taking this color right here from my ceiling and light palette is
5:37called bliss and just giving the look kind of a softer touch here on the
5:46crease
5:54this is just like a dusty rose color
5:58so we have like anything similar like a mommy brown
6:02that will work
6:10and now the last thing I'm putting on my lid is this color right here called
6:15naked lunch from mac and i'm just going to pack this on right here
6:24it's also going to be my inner corner highlight
6:32for my brow bone I'm just taking a matte beige color and hoping that right here
6:40now i'm just going to add some black eyeliner to my waterline and my tight
6:45line and then I'm going to do the rest of my face before I finish underneath my
6:51eyes
6:51the foundation i'm going to be using today is my absolute favorite drugstore
6:54foundation of all time and it is the revlon colorstay foundation specifically
6:59for normal to dry skin
7:01the other formula is way too thick and cakey I really love this formula so it's
7:08going to be popping this on my fires
7:19yeah
7:23I know what you're thinking girl that is too dark but it's not
7:28it matches my neck
7:45ok so far underneath my eyes I don't want to go to dramatic with the light
7:49concealer but i'm going to be using my Maybelline instant age rewind dark
7:53circle racer and just covering my bags a little just enough for it over look
8:00sleepy just kind of like brightening up that under I just a little
8:09I'm not bringing it down all the way to here like I normally do just because I
8:15don't know because I don't always do that
8:25yeah
8:27i'm going to set that under eye concealer with my msf natural
8:33now i'm just going to finish putting some eyeshadow underneath my eyes just
8:38to make it a little bit more smoky and for that i'm going to be taking this
8:43brown color right here called Brown down from mac and taking that on a pencil
8:51brush like this just blending that underneath
9:03ok now I'm going to add a lot of mascara i like using a really volumizing first
9:07mascara for this kind of look just because I don't like to add some winged
9:12liner to this kind of look
9:14you totally can you can just add some winged liner and then some mascara
9:17it would look really pretty regardless if you do i just kind of like to leave
9:21it like this so i'm going to coat the crap out of my lashes with my Jordan
9:26best last we're gonna best / extreme and then i'm going to go ahead and fill in
9:32my eyebrows and then I will be right by so typically if I were doing this makeup
9:37look I would do like the whole contour blush and highlight like the whole
9:42shebang
9:43but today I'm just gonna brand my face a little bit i'm going to be using my
9:47little baby hoola bronzer and by the way i have been loving this bronzer it's
9:51really really good
9:52I can see why everyone loves it i'm going to be using my Real Techniques
9:56blush brush dip an idea
9:59and kind of runs my face
10:05normally when I would contour which is not so specific
10:38ok so for my highlight i'm going to be taking it's a new purchase of my name is
10:44become my absolute favorite highlight in the entire world and it is the josie
10:49maran argan aluminized sir
10:51it's the most beautiful champagne gold highlight which is my favorite kind of
10:57my life
10:58I'm just going to pump that on the back of my hand the only thing that this
11:01squirts out a lot more than what you need just the only thing i hate feel
11:08like like that's way too much but
11:15see that do you see the beauty and you
11:22yeah
11:26yeah
11:34yeah
11:41yeah
11:42for my lips I'm going to be using a combination of two things
11:47i'm going to be using Mac myth lipstick which is a crazy crazy nude
11:53this is like intensely new so I'm only gonna like tap it on my lips
12:06and then I'm going to top it off with the covergirl jumbo gloss balm and
12:10ballet twist and top it with that
12:22ok guys and that's it of course you can change the lipstick you want to wear you
12:26can go a little bit darker but i love how this looks
12:29looks like really light new pink lips
12:32anyway I hope you enjoyed this video please subscribe if you haven't already
12:35and I will see you in my next one
0:20hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i am wearing right
0:26now it is using the Too Faced chocolate bar palette the original chocolate bar
0:30palette AKA my favorite palette of all time
0:33it has been so so highly requested to do a tutorial using this palette since you
0:37guys know it's my favorite
0:39yeah I don't have like any tutorials using it i think i only have like one or
0:43two
0:44this is my go to look with this palette if I'm gonna go out at night time or if
0:49I'm just gonna go out like special events or something like that this is
0:52the look I always do
0:54anyone hear something funny i started doing this tutorial and I did my eyes
0:57first and then i do my face and then I always liked finish up my eyes before I
1:01contour and for my blush a lot what are anyway I completely forgot to do my
1:05lower lash line and i did my entire face i put on my lips take I was even ready
1:10to say goodbye and I realized oh my gosh I didn't even finish up my eyes
1:14so in this video you will see me do like my entire face put on my lip and
1:19everything and then I finish up my eyes so not to confuse anybody would I
1:23totally blanked
1:25so yeah i really hope you like this look let me know if you guys want to see
1:28another tutorial using this palette and if you want to see how to get this one
1:32then just keep watching
1:34ok so I'm going to prime my eyes with the kat von d primer i really like it
1:38because it covers the veins on my eyes but it's a little bit too dark for me
1:42but you could definitely see it on my lids
1:45anyway so I'm going into the chocolate bar palette and I'm going to take white
1:49chocolate and i'm going to set that primary down so that it's not sticky and
1:53this is a Sephora Pro brush and then i'm taking salted caramel which is probably
1:58my favorite shadow in this palette and I'm taking it on my morphe e23 brush and
2:03I'm just putting this into my crease but I'm putting a lot of it like I really
2:07want this crease color to stand out so i'm applying a look
2:11now i'm going into semi sweet which is another brown but
2:15a little bit cooler it's not as warm as a salted caramel and i'm applying this
2:20on the outer portion of my eye and then slowly dragging it into my crease
2:25i'm using a sophie 320 brush but it's just like a mac 217 you know that kind
2:31of shape
2:32so yes as you can see I'm just dragging it little by little into my crease
2:36now i'm taking triple fudge and I'm going to do the exact same thing with
2:40the same brush only i'm applying a little bit more to the owner outer
2:43corners because I really want the outer view of the I to be like saturated with
2:48the brown shadow
2:50so I'm just packing that onto the outer corners and then dragging it all the way
2:54in on my crease
2:58I'm going back and forth it takes a little bit of time because you really
3:01wanted to look gradient and not too messy so you don't want to apply too
3:04much too fast
3:06so just apply the color a little by little and build up slowly
3:09that's how you'll get the best application
3:14I took the color semi nope no salted caramel and i just applied more into my
3:20crease and i'm highlighting underneath my brow bone with white chocolate
3:27now i'm going to marzipan this is like my other favorite shadow in the pile of
3:31it and I'm taking that like on a flat shader brush and I'm applying this
3:36wherever I didn't put any of the brown shadows
3:39then i just applied some pics + and get back into the shadow just to intensify
3:43it a little bit more but i'm just applying this on the inner parts of my
3:46eyes and then I'm going back into triple fudge and blending those two colors
3:51together because i don't want like a harsh line between the triple fudge and
3:55the marzipan
3:56you know just making sure everything is nestled lady going right back into semi
4:01sweet i'm kind of sandwiching the two colors
4:04salted caramel and triple fudge making sure it's a nice gradient effect and
4:10then i'm taking creme brulee and applying that right on top of marzipan
4:13not too much but i just wanted a little bit of gold to shine through and then
4:18i'm going to apply some eyeliner this is the Maybelline lines the little I forgot
4:22how much i love this it's so easy to use this
4:25I love it so i'm just applying you know like a thin little wing or like it's in
4:30the line on top and I'm going to do it up like a wing but i'm not going to like
4:33just yet i'll show you in a little while I'm going to tight line with this
4:38Maybelline master skinny eyeliner i forgot to show this in my drugs to
4:41review i really like it so I'm just tightening with this and I'm taking this
4:45blink ultra thin liner
4:47look at how tiny this is this is like the skinniest little brush tip I've ever
4:54seen in my life so it's so easy to get a really sharp wing with this
4:59it's amazing from the brand blink and it's awesome for a wing amazing
5:04anyway so i'm going in with mascara and then i'm popping on some violet false
5:08lashes in I do
5:11for my face I am just applying my to face
5:14I'm hangover primer and i'm applying that to my whole face and then i'm
5:17taking my aqua foundation from cogiendo and i'm applying this with a wet and
5:22wild
5:22kabuki like flat top kabuki brush love this brush
5:26I really like this foundation it's not my favorite of all time but i really do
5:30like it leaves a nice do we finish it's just very expensive so I rarely use it
5:35on camera
5:36now i'm going to conceal my under eyes and this is the collection lasting
5:41finish concealer i believe what
5:43that's what it's called I got on Amazon because i cannot get that product in the
5:47States but I have to say I really really love it and then I mix it in with my wet
5:52and wild illuminating concealer pen thingy and i'm also highlighting my face
5:56with this as well I love this is from what a while it's like three dollars and
6:00it's awesome
6:01and then I'm just buffing and blending all of that in this is a brush from
6:05bhcosmetics it's just like they're pointed at foundation brush to set that
6:12I'm going to use my RCA in ocala founder of course you already know and i'm
6:17setting that with my morphe e49 brush and I'm also setting the places i put
6:22concealer
6:23I'm not setting my whole face because I wanted to remain a little bit more dewy
6:26and this is the bronzer i've been using a lot recently it's from you and it's
6:30called Sun Tan and I just find it looks so natural on the skin i really love
6:35this bronzer
6:36i'm applying it with my morphe and b5 brush it's just like a chunky stippling
6:40brush awesome brush as well
6:45and this is a new product just recently picked it up
6:48this is from the sephora brand and it is there contouring bronzer in the shade
6:53law squabbles
6:54I really like it's the first time i use it and it's not bad and it's actually
6:57less expensive then a lot of bronzer that sephora i'm contouring my face with
7:03the sigma f 23 brush and yeah I really like that bronzer it's not bad
7:08ok so now i'm going to highlight this is the Natasha's they don't highlight in
7:12the shade 01 light
7:14i'm highlighting with a fan brush this is the morphe m310 and a really great
7:20brush so I'm a little sad because my blush broke
7:23this is a milani blush in the shade awakening rose I got mine on Amazon
7:29because I can really find it anywhere in store it was limited edition but i'm
7:32pretty sure Amazon still has its a beautiful blush and for my lips I'm
7:37lining him with mac etc lip pencil on filling in my entire lips with the ex
7:42cetera prolong wear lip pencil and then I'm going over it with my favorite loss
7:46this is buck some white russian and yes i love this little lip combination and
7:53you can totally leave your eyes like this i think it looks so pretty without
7:57a lower lash line like without a smoky lower lash line
8:00but if you're like me and you like a lower smuggle lash line then
8:04the rest of this video's for you so i'm just applying that same
8:08maybelline skinny black liner gel thingy to my waterline I don't love it as much
8:12as my next one but it is still really really good
8:18and then after that I took triple fudge brownies a wave of 238 brush to really
8:23get really close to my waterline smoke it out a little bit and then on a
8:27regular pencil brush this is from sigma i am just buffing out the salted caramel
8:32shades so that it matches with my top lid and then I just highlighted my inner
8:37corners with champagne truffle and applied the mascara and then that
8:40completes this look

4:18decay naked skin concealer in the shade a fair neutral for life
4:24I remember like neutral get there no it's very droll yes fair
4:31ok so you know the drill just blending all that stuff in with my Beauty Blender
4:37ok moving on so i'm going to set underneath my eyes so that the concealer
4:42does increase into my fine lines
4:44this is the NARS press crystal powder
4:47I believe that's what it's called i will leave the real date down below so I'm
4:52going to finish off my eyes
4:53I'm going into Pegasus with this pencil brush by makeup geek
4:58it's not called a pencil brush but it looks important so I'm just going to
5:01apply this on the inner part of my eye on the lower lash line then I'm going to
5:06take with Syria and i'm going to apply this the rest of my lashline blending
5:13those two colors together

4:06wanted it to be really like sultry and
4:07smoky and then i also added some brown
4:10script as well because I wanted it to be
4:12a little bit warmer so i just took the
4:15time to blend that out for a while and
4:16then I also blended these super sharp
4:19edges that the tape me because I do like
4:22the sharpness but i like it to be a
4:24little less like super sharp and a
4:27little more like Smokey and now i'm
4:30going to put on some false lashes and
4:32then add some liquid liner on the top
4:35like I wanted to do like a pretty thick

5:32subscribe and i'll see you in my next
5:34video bye guys
0:24hey guys so today's video is a makeup
0:27tutorial on the look i am wearing right
0:30now it is very very glamorous it's
0:33nighttime appropriate I don't exactly
0:34know what I'm going to call this look
0:36but i wanted to do a nighttime look and
0:39incorporate like summary colors in it as
0:42well so this is what I came up with it's
0:44very nice inappropriate but it's also
0:45very summery and warm and i love how it
0:48looks
0:49you could totally wear this look during
0:50the daytime if you want to just don't
0:52add false lashes just regular mascara
0:55and you're good to go but these false
0:57lashes make it look very very like
0:59glamorous and the nighttime it's like
1:01almost too much for me because I'm not
1:03used to lashes and these are very very
1:06long these are really long lashes
1:09absolutely love how it looks and it's
1:11nice to get out of my comfort zone in
1:13terms of falsies every once in a while
1:14so yeah these are my favorite colors to
1:17wear on my eyes I'm using makeup geeks
1:20Vegas lights pigment all over my lid and
1:22it is amazing it is one of the prettiest
1:24pigments ever seen and it is super
1:26affordable and I have my baby amber
1:28lights underneath
1:30I just think it looks really really nice
1:31and very summery so if you want to see
1:34how to get this look then just keep on
1:36watching
1:37ok so I'm going to start by priming my
1:39eyes I'm using Mac's painterly Paint
1:41Pots not only two prime but the cover up
1:43those horrid veins on my eyes
1:48i'm gonna apply this to my entire I and
1:50underneath my brow bone as well
1:53next I'm taking a fluffy blending brush
1:55and Max soft brown eyeshadow and i'm
1:57going to apply this in my crease just a
1:59little bit just so that the pigment that
2:01i'm going to place on my lid transitions
2:03nicely and it's going to be our
2:05transition shade
2:06next I'm going to take the star of the
2:08show and it is makeup geeks Vegas light
2:11pigment and it's a beautiful coppery
2:13color it's amazing and because this pig
2:17man has a lot of glitter i am going to
2:19spray my brush with mac fix+ you can use
2:22eye drops if you don't have six plus but
2:25this is the kind of pigment that really
2:26needs something like fix+ because if i
2:30were to apply it without it would just
2:31be like a bunch of little sparkles all
2:34over my eye and the fix+ really
2:36intensifies it and just makes it so much
2:39prettier so i'm going to apply this to
2:41my entire lid right up to my crease
2:47[Music]
2:52next on my mac 217 i'm going to go into
2:55the color saddle by Mac this is just
2:57like a medium brown with a lot of like
2:59red to it's a very warm Brown and I'm
3:02just gonna start blending out this
3:03pigment little by little
3:05this part is pretty tedious i go back
3:08into the saddle color over and over
3:10again and just slowly but surely start
3:12to blend the saddle color into my crease
3:15and blend away any harsh lines that the
3:18pigment made so like I said it's a
3:21little tedious just go back and forth
3:23and slowly bring that color up
3:28then I'm going to go back into my love
3:30be blending brush and blend out any
3:32harsh edges then back into the 217 with
3:35some more saddle and just slowly defuse
3:37this color and start bringing it up and
3:39blow it out into the crease and again
3:42some more back and forth
3:44[Music]
3:47now i'm just going to take a makeup wipe
3:49and clean any of the follow and then add
3:52a sharp cat I to my eyeshadow so once i
3:57do that and get it nice and sharp as you
3:58see here it looks nice and sharp i'm
4:01just going to go back into the color
4:03soft brown by mac and add some to my
4:06crease
4:11I'm going to take this i call from mac
4:13and think it's called coaster reach
4:15coaster Richie coaster each not exactly
4:17sure but it is a nice warm brown have
4:20like red undertone to it and it's really
4:22beautiful
4:23I have repurchased this numerous times i
4:25love it and I'm just adding that to my
4:27waterline and my timeline and then i'm
4:29going to go ahead and prime my face with
4:32Too Faced primed and poreless primer and
4:38then the foundation i'm going to be
4:40using is my l'oreal true match and three
4:42natural stuff and i'm using this with my
4:45Real Techniques sponge I've actually
4:47been using this a lot more than my
4:49Beauty Blender a kind of neglected my
4:51blood my Beauty Blender a little bit so
4:53this one is just so amazing you can get
4:56it at the real on the Real Techniques
4:57website or an ultra calm i recommend
5:00it's very inexpensive and just as good
5:03as the Beautyblender it does soak up a
5:05little bit more product than the
5:06Beautyblender does in my opinion but
5:08it's really good
5:31next I'm going to add my concealer i'm
5:34using my boo cover up concealer and just
5:37applying it underneath my eyes to cover
5:39my dark circles and to highlight my face
5:41as well have seen me do this part a
5:43million times but i'm just letting it
5:45out with my finger and then I'm going to
5:47blend it out some more with my
5:48self-appointed foundation brush I'm
5:51going to do that to both eyes of course
5:57[Music]
6:02to set my under eye concealer to prevent
6:05it from creasing i am using Mac's
6:06emphasize powder and just dabbing that
6:09underneath my eyes I have to set my
6:11under eye concealer because I'm not it
6:12will crease on me
6:13so this just prevent creasing
6:19now i'm going back onto my eyes I'm
6:22using the bombs winged eyeliner
6:25this is a great high-end liquid liner
6:28it's probably my favorite one dries
6:29matte and it's super easy to use
6:31I'm just going to add a thin line i'm
6:34not gonna wing it out or anything just
6:35the really thin line i'm gonna take my
6:38clinic / doubling mascara and i'm gonna
6:40apply a very thin coat of this to my
6:43lashes because i will be going in with
6:44falsies and the falsies i will be using
6:47our the red cherry 217 and I'm not used
6:51to applying them on camera yet so
6:53forgive me I have to apply them off
6:54camera that takes forever but then i'm
6:57going to move on to underneath my
6:58lashline and i'm using Mac's amberlite
7:01this is my all-time favorite eyeshadow
7:03you guys know this it's so beautiful and
7:07i'm just going to apply a generous
7:08amount underneath my lashes and being
7:12very sloppy with this because I wanted
7:13to be like everywhere underneath my
7:15lashes
7:25then I'm going to clean my pencil brush
7:27and apply max nylon to the very inner
7:31part of my I like the tear duct area
7:33just to highlight and i love this
7:35eyeshadow for the internet that's
7:36beautiful
7:38then for underneath my brow bone since
7:39there's so much shimmer going on i'm
7:41just going to take a matte cream color
7:42and apply this underneath my brow bone
7:45here i'm using the cream shade in my
7:47lorac Pro palette just any mac color
7:50will be fine and then i'm going to apply
7:52a thin coat of the clinic mascara to my
7:56bottom lashes i'm gonna add some bronzer
7:59to my face and I'm using the NARS Laguna
8:00bronzer this is such a beautiful summer
8:03bronzer because it has a little bit of
8:04sparkle in it but it doesn't really come
8:06off when you put it on your face it's
8:08just very warm and beautiful so I'm
8:10going to contour my face with this i am
8:12using the papered highlighting brush
8:15from sigma I'm just gonna fly this
8:17around my forehead and you know other
8:20places where you know
8:21contoured
8:35[Music]
8:37then I'm gonna add some blush I'm using
8:39milania's Luminoso blush it's a
8:42beautiful like warm peach but I'm only
8:44adding just a light wash of this to my
8:46cheeks nothing too crazy and then for my
8:51lips I'm using Revlon's smoke peach
8:53lipstick and i'm just going to dab this
8:56on a little bit i don't want too much
8:58pigment to come off and then I'm going
9:00to top it off with NYX butter gloss and
9:02fortune cookie i have been using this
9:03non-stop you guys know i've been using
9:05it like crazy so I'm just going to add
9:07that right on top
9:13ok so that completes this nice copper
9:18summer night makeup look I really hope
9:20you guys enjoyed thank you so much for
9:22watching please subscribe if you haven't
9:23already and I will see you in my next
9:25video bye
0:23hey guys todays video is a tutorial on this makeup right here and this had to
0:28be a voiceover unfortunately because when i filmed this I was still trying to
0:33get over my cold but it's a really intense look and it's perfect for new
0:37years eve so the first thing I'm gonna do is take my Urban Decay primer potion
0:42and i'm gonna be putting this all over my lids as my primer then I'm taking
0:45some tape putting it in the back of my hand a few times and then putting that
0:49on the side of my eye to create a cat eye effect and then taking my NYX jumbo
0:54eye pencil in black bean i'm going to put this on my lid and then blend it out
0:58with a brush and I'm not going to be taking this past the crease
1:05I'm going to take max torque I shadow and i'm gonna be using this to blend
1:10this color into my crease this look takes a lot a lot of blending a lot of
1:16dedication and blending it's just you gotta really blend these colors into the
1:20crease this is what's going to make it look nice and smoky and blown out i'm
1:25going to take this color right here it's off from mac and it's called Brown down
1:28and then with a more precise blending brush I'm going to be putting this like
1:32directly into the socket of my crease and then blending it up to get it again
1:36like blown out and more smoky i'm going to go back and forth between blending
1:40brushes and make sure that it's nice and blended
1:47now i'm taking the showstopper of this tutorial and it is this pigment called
1:52utopia it is by make a peak and it's amazing i'm going to spray fix+ on my
1:57brush and dip it into the cap and then start patting this on my lid that fix+
2:02really makes a difference with this eyeshadow it just makes it look old and
2:06metallic and so intense and I'm obsessed with it so I want to get it really
2:10precise right up to my crease and I'm not gonna take it pass there because
2:14it's going to be a glittery mess if I do then I'm taking that browndown color
2:18again and I'm going to start blending some more like I said it's just a lot of
2:23crease blending this is just the tricky part of the whole tutorial is just
2:28really getting those priests colors blend it out so just go back and forth
2:33and I really take my time with this
2:38yeah
2:41yeah
2:47now i'm taking max room as my brow bone highlight and my inner corner highlight
2:53as well then i'm taking my Maybelline master drama eyeliner and midnight
2:59master and I am tight lining with this and also putting this all over my
3:02waterline from my eyeliner I'm using the NYC liquid eyeliner and I'm you doing a
3:07very thin line because I really want the glitter and the pigment to really stand
3:13out so i'm just doing it very thin then i'm taking max carbon on a very very
3:18small shader brush and I'm putting this in my crease very precisely this is kind
3:23of like a soft cup priests because it's not it's not a full-blown cut crease
3:28it's not as dramatic as a cook crease but kinda like the same concept where
3:32I'm just really putting it into the crease very precisely i just go back and
3:37forth and I blend that out that's why I'm fast-forwarding this because I'm not
3:41this video would be like 45 minutes long
3:43it's just a lot of blending like i have said 50 times already
3:48I'm just taking off the tape and then cleaning around my eye
3:56I'm going to take browndown and much that underneath my lower lashline and
4:02then kind of them out of the frame I know I'm terrible but I'm just softening
4:06up the edge of that cat I because i don't want it too sharp and then take
4:10cork by mac and I'm doing the exact same thing I'm seeing my mascara I'm using my
4:16wedding while Michael volume and my jordana best / extreme and I'm just
4:19packing on this mascara you totally could use false lashes I think that
4:24false lashes will look beautiful for this look but you know me guys I'm not
4:28really a fall / where but you go ahead and go on which bed so if you do I have
4:35priming my face with my L'Oreal True Match Lumi primer and then i'm taking my
4:38urban decay naked skin foundation and putting this all over my face is perfect
4:43for New Year's Eve because it photographed beautifully i'm taking my
4:46mac prolongwear concealer and i'm using this to cover my dark circles and to
4:50right underneath my eyes this is also perfect consider for new years because
4:53it lasts all day and it does increase and it doesn't cake and it's perfect for
4:58that then I'm taking my mac msf natural to just set that concealer
5:05I'm taking my benefit hoola bronzer and i'm using this to contour my face and
5:09two bronze up my face a little bit i'm not going to like a super dramatic like
5:14eight contour but i do want to chisel out my cheekbones a little bit for this
5:20look
5:30now taking the next blush in the color mom think it's called pressure and i'm
5:36just adding this really lightly on my cheeks there's so much going on in my
5:40eyes that I don't want too much going on my base then i'm taking my mac
5:44mineralize skinfinish and soft and gentle as my highlight i'm taking my
5:48angel lipstick and then i'm going to top it off with NYX butter gloss and creme
5:52brulee as per usual love this gloss and that completes the look
5:57thank you so much for watching guys subscribe you haven't already and I'll
6:00see you next time
0:26hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing I
0:30wanted to do something around the theme of just like one color like a
0:35monochromatic kind of look kind of like a dusty rose
0:39eyeshadow blush and lipstick kind of look
0:43actually my liner is a lot bigger than I wanted it to be but it's ok actually
0:47really like how it turned out for those of you requesting a very like springy
0:52dewy fresh natural makeup that is coming up soon i wanted to do something a
0:57little bit more bold and dramatic first since i rarely do
1:00looks like this so yes I really use winged liner because i suck at it but
1:06I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone
1:08more and more every day basically if you know how to do winged liner then this is
1:11the easiest look of life the only difficult part is the winged liner
1:15because it's literally the easiest
1:17I look known to man so yeah if you want to see how to get this look then just
1:22keep watching
1:23ok so I'm going to be priming my eyelids with the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
1:26potion this is the new one well i mean i want to say new but it's pretty new and
1:30it's in the shape even i believe and then i'm going to set that with some
1:33translucent powder
1:35so to start off this I look I'm just using two shadows
1:38this one is from NARS it's one of their dual intensity eyeshadows it's in the
1:42shape qari and i'm just adding this as my transition shade you can totally skip
1:46this step because you could do that with this eyeshadow as well
1:50this is the star attraction this is colour-pop superstock super shock shadow
1:55in models
1:57wwat tles yes models that is what I'm putting on my entire lid and in my
2:03crease as well when you're working with color pop shadows in the crease make
2:07sure you're using like fluffy synthetic brushes because they just work best with
2:12the colour-pop formula so i'm using all synthetic brushes here to highlight
2:17underneath my brow bone i just used a light-reflecting powder this is a
2:21setting powder from laura geller just using that to highlight Oh
2:24little bit underneath my brow bone nothing too crazy and then i'm going to
2:28tight line with the next specially liner in jet black or pitch black
2:33yes pitch black and now to apply this wing
2:37ok guys I cannot do my wing on camera because i have to get super close to the
2:40mirror but just do your wing the way you would normally do it my wings got a
2:44little cray-cray as you can see here a thicker than a snicker I didn't want
2:49them this thing but we're going to go ahead and go with it
2:52I think it's cool to have bold line every once in a while so I just prime my
2:56face with the Knicks born to glow illuminating primer and then i'm going
3:00in with foundation
3:01this is the benefit hello flawless oxygen while foundation
3:06this was the first time I used it I am using a more feet esox brush to apply
3:09this and i really like the foundation is a little bit too yellow for my undertone
3:14I have more of a neutrally undertone but it's a really pretty foundation
3:17I forgot to show you the concealer i was using so I'm holding it up here this is
3:21the Maybelline better skin concealer and i'm just applying this underneath my
3:26eyes to cover my dark circles and to highlight my face but you've seen me
3:29blend in concealer about a million times right so i don't have to show you every
3:33little thing just blend netted i'm going to set my under eye concealer with my
3:38cosmetics
3:39bye bye pores powder i'm using a Sephora Pro 90 brush to apply this and I'm also
3:47just applying that on any area where i applied concealer and now to finish up
3:51my eyes i'm going to apply some nude liner this is the Rimmel scandaleyes
3:55nude liner i believe it's called nude
4:00and then I'm going to take models one more time and apply this to my lower
4:03lashline just that it can match with little lint matchy-matchy
4:08for mascara i'm actually not going in with my kiko one
4:11surprisingly i'm going in with the it cosmetics superhero mascara
4:15then I applied some falsies and i'm highlighting my inner corners with
4:19makeup geek whimsical eyeshadow and that completes the is I'm moving on to Z face
4:24right now I'm going to take the Prime and fine
4:27catrice contouring palette I got this at ulta and it was so affordable i think it
4:32was like under three dollars and it doesn't really nice job at contouring I
4:36like the undertone and it blends out really really nicely and then i'm going
4:40to just warm up my skin a little bit using this elf mineral bronzer in the
4:44shade tan toffee and with a morph a stippling brush
4:48I am just loving this onto my face to just add a little bit of warmth to the
4:52look
4:53so for blush I'm actually using the eyeshadow using my crease earlier this
5:00is the NARS dual intensity eyeshadow and khari and yes I'm using i thought i was
5:05a blush because why not
5:07I just wanted everything to match really nicely and I think this is a really
5:10pretty blush so moving on i'm going to highlight the tops of my cheekbones
5:14using the Natasha Nona glow powder in the shade light
5:1801 I'm just blending that on the tops of my cheekbones and on my nose to
5:22highlight and to finish off the look I'm going to add some lip liner this is the
5:27Aquarius lip liner by color pop and then right on top of it i'm going to go in
5:32with another color pop product
5:34this is choker I believe yes
5:37choker Libby stick
5:38that's going right on top of the Aquarius lip liner this is a cream
5:42finish i really like this lipstick
5:44so that completes this video I hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for
5:49watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my
5:52next video bye
0:11hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look right
0:17here
0:17I think this is the first makeup tutorial I've ever done where I'm
0:21completely matte
0:22I'm like Matt guys I'm Matt I'm looking at my skin of clothes and I'm not used
0:28to ever looking this map but I kind of like it actually did a little bit of
0:31highlight on the tip of my nose
0:33I don't know why but I did I love this look I think it's very sexy and smoky
0:37but very simple at the same time I feel like this is the perfect look for
0:42anything any kind of occasion if you're going to a wedding if you're going to a
0:46baby shower if you're going to prom if you're going to graduation
0:48it's not super plane but it's not dramatic either you know it's somewhere
0:52in between and I love wearing this look with no falsies like just a ton of
0:56mascara
0:57I know I've been thinking this isn't like every video but I was smelling a
1:00candle and I accidentally burned off some eyelashes
1:03it's a long story but since i couldn't put on just mascara along this side
1:06because you couldn't see anything i decided to add individual lashes on this
1:11I only and hopefully it doesn't look bad
1:14this look is so pretty for those of you with green eyes or brown eyes or hazel
1:18eyes
1:19I think the pinky purple e tones in the brown I Federals really complement those
1:24colors but anybody can wear this
1:25so you have you want to see how to get this one hundred percent Matt makeup
1:29look then just keep watching
1:31ok so I'm going to start off by priming my eyelids i'm using the Urban Decay
1:35primer potion in the shade enigma
1:37I've really been liking this because a cover-up it covers up all my veins I'm
1:41taking this anastacio eyeshadow in the shade bone to kind of set that primer
1:46down and then I applied some tape to the corners of my eyes to create kind of
1:50like a cat eye effect
1:51make sure when you are doing this you put the tape on the back your hand a
1:54couple times so it doesn't stick to the skin
1:57I took the Anasazi eyeshadow in the shade Gary and I was just applying that
2:01into my crease and buffing that close to the tape
2:04and then I took another anastacio eyeshadow this one is in the shade
2:08birkin and I'm pretty much doing the exact same thing I am bluffing this into
2:12my crease but also applying it to the outer corners as well I took this NARS
2:16eyeshadow in the shade sophia and i am just bluffing that on the outer corners
2:21and into my crease as well I'm pretty much doing the exact same process with
2:25all the shadows only I'm going from light to dark to create kind of like a
2:29gradient effect with these colors
2:31I went back into de-rate by anastacio and I'm just blending out the harsh
2:35edges in my crease so everything is nice and blended so this is another nars
2:40eyeshadow this is in the shade Coconut Grove it's kind of like a super dark
2:43matte Brown and on an angled brush this is an angled brush from zoeva i'm
2:48creating a winged eyeliner but it's going to be a lot softer and a lot
2:53easier to do because you're doing it with eyeshadow so it won't be as harsh
2:56or as hard to do so i'm just getting really close to the tape the tape is
3:00kind of like my guideline to create that wing you see what I'm doing so I'm also
3:05taking a little blending brush and buffing some of that coconut rogue ride
3:09and the outer corners really close to the tape
3:12just like can be nice and blended and then I went back in with the angled
3:16brush and coconut grove and sharpen that up a little bit i'm taking anastacio
3:20bone again and i'm using this to highlight underneath my brow bone and
3:24now we can move on to see face while it took off the tape and now i'm moving on
3:28to the face
3:29i'm using the NYX angel real primer to prime my face for foundation and the
3:34foundation I'm using today is the clinique beyond perfecting foundation
3:38I have the shade linen I really like this nomination when I want to look a
3:42little bit more mad because it has kind of like a satin finish it's not
3:46completely mad but on my dry skin it does look a little bit like satin need
3:51you know I like it I like it doesn't look at drying or anything to go
3:56underneath my eyes I thought that the collection perfect lasting concealer was
4:00literally ideal for this look because it is a mac concealer I don't know how to
4:05explain it but it blends out really well and has great coverage but it doesn't
4:09look dewy under the eyes at all so if you have an oily under eye area i really
4:15suggest this concealer it's a very of a don't know what I'm doing there
4:18but it's very inexpensive and it has great coverage to set that i'm using the
4:22it cosmetics
4:23bye bye pores powder and i'm applying that underneath my eyes with the morphe
4:2748 brush or e 46
4:29i believe so I'm just setting that so it does increase underneath the eyes and
4:33then I thought you know what I want to be mad so I'm just going to go ahead and
4:36set the rest of my face
4:38I probably should have switched brushes because this is very little for the
4:41whole face but whatever I want with it
4:42so to finish off the eyes i'm taking the essence
4:46smokey liner this is like a casual liner like a coal liner in black really black
4:52really awesome great for smudging i took the NARS eye shadow in the shape coconut
4:57grove and I'm just buffing that really really close to the eyeliner to create
5:00kind of like a smoky effect and then I went into the NARS eyeshadow in the
5:04shade sophia and i pretty much the exact same thing making it nice deep and as
5:09smokey
5:10I took the Anasazi eyeshadow in the shade dairy one more time and just bust
5:14that underneath my lower lash line with a pencil brush so it's not too harsh or
5:18too dark and i decided to go in with some individual lashes on my left eye
5:22you guys know accidentally burn them off with the flame of a candle
5:26long story but i decided to pop them on my left eye
5:30I didn't do it on my right I do you think it looks bad i don't know i think
5:33it doesn't look too bad i put on some jordana best / extreme mascara and then
5:38popped on some ardell individuals on my left eye and I think that it balances
5:42out pretty well
5:43I just highlighted my inner corner with that bone shadow
5:47so to finish off the face I'm taking the physicians formula butter bronzer and I
5:52chose this bronzer because it's not completely like one hundred percent matt
5:56has a little bit of life to it not like shimmer or anything but a little bit of
6:01life to it so I thought it would complement this look really well and
6:04then for my sheiks i decided to go in
6:07with a bronzer by urban decay this is in the shade sunkist but it's too pinky
6:12tone for the whole face so I like using it on my cheeks i think it gives you
6:16like a really pretty gorgeous summary look to the cheeks
6:20nice and warm really pretty as a blush I wanted a little bit of something like a
6:24little bit of highlight so I took the laura mercier Matt highlight and i just
6:28bought that on my nose I don't know why but i did so for the finishing touch
6:32i'm going in with these you a liquid lipstick in the shade due to the lecture
6:36I thought it complemented the eyes perfectly and that completes the look
6:40thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
6:43and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing it is
0:16literally the easiest
0:18I look ever I know I say that a lot but this one is really easy yet still looks
0:22nice and sultry and smoky
0:25perfect for beginners really excited for this one because today's video is
0:27sponsored by she sado i'm going to be using their synchro skin lasting liquid
0:33foundation in today's tutorial and I will go into detail about this guy in a
0:37second i'm usually the shade
0:39golden - but in today's video I mixed a little bit of golden for in with this
0:44because gold into is too light and golden force too dark so I mixed a
0:47little nibble
0:48but besides that I love this look and this I look was created with really
0:52really affordable products
0:54so yes if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
0:57so please excuse my eyes and also excuse my voice I am sick at the moment I'm
1:02going to take the hard candy hydrating primer missed and spring that on my face
1:06and then i'm going to prime my face using the NYX angel veil primer
1:13and for foundation I'm going to be using the shiseido synchro skin lasting liquid
1:19foundation this foundation comes in 11 shades and it was actually designed to
1:24synchronize with your skin so that it can look really natural when you apply
1:26it which I totally agree with by the way I think that once i apply this this
1:31looks really really natural on my skin
1:33shiseido is actually known for their skin care and all of their foundations
1:37have skincare benefits in them which is pretty cool
1:41also this foundation is oil-free it has SPF 20 but I don't find that it gives me
1:46a white cast and photos
1:47I tried with my camera and i get 0 flashback in photography
1:52I also think the coverage is great i'm not sure if you can tell but it does a
1:55great job of covering up my redness but i do think it's buildable I think it's a
1:59medium coverage but definitely buildable because it feels just so weightless on
2:03the skin
2:04so moving on i'm going in with my concealer this is the Catrice camouflage
2:08concealer and this has great coverage so obviously i'm using it because my eyes
2:12are very very red at the moment so I'm just blending that in with my Real
2:16Techniques sponge
2:20-
2:23and then i'm going to set my under eye concealer using my NARS translucent
2:28crystal powder
2:32-
2:35for my bronzer i'm going to be using this bareMinerals bearskin sheer son
2:42serum bronzer it has a long name but I love this liquid bronzer I think it's
2:46one of my favorite later bronzers I've ever tried
2:49I guess because it's a serum it just blends really really well on the skin so
2:53i'm just applying that to my face to not only bronze up the skin but contour a
2:57bit as well i'm going to take this elf total face powder I'm gonna dip my brush
3:04into the bronzer shade in this palette i'm just going to warm up my skin with
3:08this color
3:10I really like this bronzer because even though it is warm
3:13it's subtle and it's not like an orange you warm it's very very flattering
3:17ok I'm just going to take the blush in this palette this is like a really
3:21peachy pretty blush i'm just applying this with my Sonia Kashuk blush brush
3:25and now moving on to the eyes i'm taking this milani shadow stick in the shade
3:29cafe au lait it's a really pretty cool tone brown
3:32I'm just buffing that onto my lid with a synthetic brush
3:37I'm gonna take the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and I'm going to
3:42take this mix crease brush I'm taking this really like brown shade and
3:46blending this into the crease you just kind of get rid of any harsh lines then
3:50I'm going to take the wet and wild single eyeshadow in the shade nutty
3:54this was a super affordable product i think it was like two dollars and I am
3:58just applying this to my entire lid and I'm gonna go back into that brown shade
4:02and just stuff it some more
4:03you know no harsh lines blending monday morning this is another single shadow
4:07from the brand wet and wild
4:08it's called sugar and i'm using this to highlight my brow bone but to highlight
4:12my inner corners I'm taking the elf baked blush in the shade pink tastic i'm
4:17going to type line with a black eyeliner and also apply some to my waterline and
4:21then blend it out with a little angled brush this was the next regularly black
4:26gel liner
4:27i'm going in with this wet and wild eyeshadow another single eyeshadow this
4:30is in the shade panther
4:32it's a really rich black and I'm just gonna use this as an eyeliner instead of
4:36using a liquid liner or a gel liner i'm just going to take an angled brush and
4:40dip it into the eye shadow and create an eyeliner this way it's very very
4:43beginner friendly and so easy to do so then I'm going to go on my lower lash
4:48line and just buff out that brown shade just so that the black doesn't look too
4:51harsh and unblended so I'm just popping on some mascara this is the key go extra
4:56scoop the volume mascara and then i'm going to go ahead and bronze my skin a
5:00little bit more i just wanted a little bit more bronzer
5:03I was feeling more randomness so I'm taking the NARS Laguna bronzer and just
5:08applying that to my face and then to highlight the tops of my cheekbones I'm
5:11taking elf baked blush and pink tastic the same product we use on the inner
5:16corners just to give my face that glow
5:20and then for lips my lips are naturally very very red and pigmented as you can
5:24see so i just take a little bit of concealer and I just wanted to like new
5:27out the color of my lips so just blend that out and then apply the NYX butter
5:32gloss in the shade fortune cookie and then that completes this look
5:35thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
5:38and I will see you in my next video bye
0:21hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right
0:27now it is very dramatic for me but it should be it is a new years eve makeup
0:31tutorial and whenever I think of New Year's Eve I think a really dramatic
0:35makeup
0:36it is mainly using the Gwen Stefani palette by urban decay
0:40I used mainly these shadows but i did use this bad boy here this is probably
0:45the star of the show
0:46this is the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade telepathy
0:50it's the color have all over my eyelids this of course is the eyeshadow i
0:54created with the where the night is quad which this quad is available to purchase
0:59right now
1:00this is my newest collab with color pop and i will link this down below i will
1:05link where you can purchase this little quad down below so i know that some
1:09people might not like this because it is like a very harsh kind of islets not to
1:14blended but i really like that for new years eve i think it's different it's
1:18fun
1:18so yes I hope you guys enjoy and if you want to see how to get this makeup look
1:22then just keep watching
1:24ok so I've already applied my eyeshadow primer and i'm applying some tape to the
1:29sides of my eyes to create a sharper
1:31look I'm going into the Gwen Stefani palette but with urban decay and I'm
1:34taking the shade Anaheim and i'm using this as my transition shade i'm applying
1:38this into my crease so that all of the other eyeshadows can blend a lot easier
1:43going into this street called zone it's a little bit warmer and deeper than
1:46anaheim i'm going to take the exact same brush this is a Sephora Pro crease brush
1:51probably my favorite crease brush of all time and i'm applying this really really
1:54close to the tape and then dragging it into the crease that is the main
1:59technique i will be doing throughout this whole video
2:01I'm gonna take the red shade in the palette it's like a really dark rider
2:05it's my favorite shades in this palette and I'm taking as a way of a brush that
2:08looks pretty much identical to the mac 217 and i'm going to start applying this
2:12eyeshadow directly like on the tape and then dragging it in the same way I did
2:17with the crease brush and then I'm going to take a blackout and apply this again
2:21really really really close to the tape and then dragging in I want like a
2:25gradient effect from the tape to the inner corners now I'm going to take the
2:29colour-pop super shock shadow in telepathy and i'm going to start taking
2:33it on my finger i'm applying this pretty much everywhere there isn't the black
2:37eyeshadow and then i went in with a synthetic brush to be a little bit more
2:40precise and I went in with the same so a brush and I'm starting to blend these
2:46colors together
2:47I didn't want like a cool harsh line which it is what what ended up happening
2:52but I wanted to make sure that it didn't look too harsh that everything was just
2:55a little bit more blended I went into the shade
3:00blondie or blogs i'm not exactly sure and I use this to highlight my brow bone
3:05then I went to this really really pretty gold it has a little bit of green to it
3:08so it / pairs perfectly with telepathy and I use that to apply to my inner
3:13corners and then I am priming my face with the Bekaa backlight primer i love
3:19it when i took my Maybelline fit me
3:21matte and poreless a foundation can I speak today my foundation
3:25hit me not important and applying that to my entire face i really really really
3:29love this foundation and i'm using a Sephora Pro air brush to blend that in
3:34and then I got this concealer on amazon
3:37when I was like shopping for some UK makeup and this is the Rimmel wake me up
3:41concealer so i'm just applying this underneath my eyes and other places I
3:45would highlight this is the first time i used it and actually really really like
3:48it i think it's very similar to the Maybelline better skin and Maybelline
3:52fit me Oh
3:53yeah i was watching a really emotional episode of the flash
3:57so I was like crying and really really trying not to mess up my makeup but
4:01anyway just blended that in like you've seen me do a million times and to set
4:04that i am using my NYC translucent setting powder
4:08I just got this to test it out and i really like it didn't look cakey
4:11underneath my eyes which I usually have that problem
4:14ok so back to the eyes before I finish my face I'm going to take zone again but
4:19I'm taking it on a pencil brush and I'm applying this all the way on my lower
4:23lash line from outer corner to inner corner and i'm taking my holy grail
4:27black eyeliner and i'm applying this to my waterline and this is the Knicks gel
4:32black eyeliner and i'm applying this to my tight line as well but not all the
4:36way in
4:37so I'm taking black out and i'm only going to apply this shadow on the outer
4:41corners of my eye I want the inner corners to be nice and bright and like
4:44green gold
4:46I'm going back into that gold and i'm applying this in my inner corners again
4:49just to intensify them a little bit and then i'm applying it a little bit on my
4:53lower lash line and I'm going back into telepathy and i'm applying this on the
4:58inner part of my lower lashline just so that i can match with the top part of my
5:03lid so i'm going in with some falsies and these are the velour still clashes
5:08that they made with some for other not mink
5:10they are soaked and um they're pretty good i like them so i'm going to contour
5:15my face using the morphe and the contour palette and I'm gonna contour my face
5:20with the shade I . that I'm just contouring like I usually do
5:25warming up the skin you know you know
5:31and now i want to brighten up my under eyes so I'm taking this really like
5:35shade in the palette and on my real techniques setting brush i'm just
5:39applying this underneath my eyes to really brighten up the look
5:45and I'm not really into this whole baking trend i don't i don't really do
5:49it at all but I think for new years eve for like a special occasion it
5:53it does look really nice so I'm just doing that underneath my contour to make
5:57my contour a little bit more visible and then I'm just brushing it away a couple
6:00minutes later and it really does help make your content look nice and sharp so
6:06for blush I'm taking my favorite blush of all time I just goes with everything
6:10this is nars madly blush
6:12it's my all-time favorite and i'm just applying this on to the sheiks and then
6:16i'm going in with highlights
6:18this is the Knicks illuminator in the sheet of ritual istic and I like it but
6:22it takes a lot of building up its kind of like a stiffer formula so it's not
6:26really intense it's not bad it's just um I really have to build up for the color
6:31to show and I'm going to go in with this 24 of collection lip liner in the shade
6:36nudists but it was a little bit too purple for me so I want i wanted
6:41something a little peach here so i took the kat von d liquid lipstick in noble
6:44and I applied it on top and then that completes this look I really hope you
6:48guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you
6:52haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:24hey guys so today's to do is another tutorial using the Urban Decay electric
0:29palette it is mainly well pretty much only using thrash and gonzo it's a
0:36little bit wearable i feel i would definitely go out and rock this and
0:40where this which I am today about you guys did ask me if I could do some more
0:45tutorials using this palette and of course I will absolutely
0:49why not I think people are kind of afraid of that palette because there's
0:53just so many crazy colors in it but you don't have to use all of those colors
0:57you can use different eyeshadows with those colors more neutral ones more
1:02wearable ones you could use that palette for like a pop of color one day in the
1:06spring and summer I just think that people are a little bit overwhelmed with
1:09the palette because there's so many colors and like nothing neutral you can
1:13kind of mix imagine you can come up with wearable looks with that pilot believe
1:17it or not this look right here maybe wearable for some people and for others
1:21and maybe like whoa even that's together phone too intense for me so I mean it's
1:25all about preference
1:26some people like it some people want but it's fun to experiment with colors I
1:29feel since i'm a very neutral girl so I'm really loving this palette so far so
1:34if you want to see how to get this line green and teal look then just keep
1:38watching
1:39ok let's do this i'm priming my eyes with Mac's painterly Paint Pot and i'm
1:45going to take this all over my lid and up to my eyebrow then I'm going to take
1:50an eyeshadow that is pretty much the exact same color as my skin tone and I'm
1:54going to put this all over my lid and underneath my brow bone to highlight as
1:58well
2:03I'm going to take an eyeshadow this just a couple shades darker than my actual
2:06skin tone or not even a couple shades just like a shade darker than my skin
2:10tone and i'm going to be blending this into the crease and this is gonna be our
2:14transition color use any eyeshadow you have now i'm going to go into this color
2:21here called thrash and it's just a very intense lime green and I'm taking it on
2:26a little blending brush from Ecotools and i'm going to be building this color
2:31into my crease very very slowly i'm gonna be packing it on the outer part of
2:35my eye and then bringing it into my crease and i'm going to be doing this
2:38over and over and over again this look especially requires a lot of blending
2:43and just going back and forth into that eyeshadow and building it up to the
2:47intensity that you prefer so i'm going to be doing that i'm also going to be
2:52dragging it up past my crease a little bit just to let everything is nice and
2:56blended and it's not a harsh straight line
2:59just take your time with this and build up that green color little by little
3:08yeah
3:13yeah
3:16I'm gonna go back into that eyeshadow i use all over my lid and I'm just gonna
3:20add some more to my lid because some of it did get blended away i'm going to be
3:24doing this quite a few times just going back and forth like I said into the
3:28green intensifying the green and then intensifying the litter aided by the way
3:32if you're wondering what I use on my linen in my crease they are the match
3:36shuttles from the kat von d ladybird palette but you can use whichever
3:40eyeshadows you
3:57now on a more precise blending brushes stiff dome brush I'm going to take it
4:04and dip it right into trash and then just apply it right into my crease to
4:08intensify my crease a little bit more really quickly I'm going to tightline
4:16and I'm going to use my Maybelline master drama in midnight master and then
4:22I'm gonna add my wing
4:23every time i do my wing it gets out of focus i know i suck but i just did a
4:27pretty thin wing on top and then did a nice long look I'm going to go back into
4:34the eyeshadow i use all over my lid one more time just to intensify it because
4:39you know some of it did get blended away and i'm going to be focusing it on the
4:42center of my eyelid and towards mightier duct
4:50yeah
4:52yeah
4:53yeah
4:54really quickly I'm going to curl my lashes and use my Too Faced better than
4:58sex mascara policies would be more ideal for this look but you guys know I don't
5:02really use falsies that much I feel free to use them
5:06I'm going to prime my face with the Maybelline Baby skin and then i'm going
5:09to go in with my foundation it is the most statement I use this like crazy
5:13it's honestly one of my favorite drugstore foundations it's just so easy
5:17to apply and i love that Lucy texture so I'm going to be applying this all over
5:22my face
5:30yeah
5:39yeah
5:40yeah
5:42friends my eyes I'm gonna use Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade fair and
5:47i'm going to highlight with this as well i'm going to be blending that in with my
5:55Real Techniques contour brush
6:08to finish off my eye makeup i'm gonna go in with this urban decay eyeliner in the
6:13shade main line which is a really beautiful matte teal color and then i'm
6:17going to be taking the brush that comes with the electric palette and I'm gonna
6:22dip it into the shape gonzo and I am just going to smudge this on my lower
6:26lashline then I'm just going to blend it out with a pencil brush so it's not too
6:36harsh and it's nice and seamless the mascara i'm gonna be using car bottom
6:42lashes is the clinic bottom lash mascara to set my foundation i am using my Mac
6:52msf natural in medium and I'm taking it on my ELF kabuki brush and I'm just
6:56going to lightly dust this all over my face to set my under eye can see there

7:36cosmetics blush brush and I'm just gonna add just a touch of this on my cheeks my
7:45lips i am taking this lipstick by Mac called salute and it was limited edition
7:49but just take any light peachy shade you have I'm dabbing it on my lips because
7:54it is very very pigmented and I don't want too much to come off on my lips
7:57gloss amusing over top is nicks creme brulee and then that completes this
8:07makeup look I really hope you enjoyed this video thank you so much for
8:10watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my
8:14next video
0:28hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial using the brand new
0:34Urban Decay electric palette which looks like oh well I don't know that was
0:47totally unnecessary
0:48I know anyway this isn't a full-face makeup tutorial just because i didn't
0:52want the video to be so long since at the end of the video I'm going to be
0:56doing a quick review on this and join us watches and what I think of the palette
1:01so I didn't want to go into a full face of makeup and then do a review and have
1:05this video be like 30 minutes long
1:07I'm not rested today so yeah you want to see swatches and my thoughts about this
1:13pilot just stay tuned to the end of the video but if you want to see how to get
1:17this look then just keep on watching
1:19oh I'll show you like my lip combo to though
1:22yeah keep watchin so the first thing I'm going to do is take my little rock
1:27behind the scenes eye primer and this is what i'm going to use to prime my lids
1:30and then i'm taking a lot of it underneath my eyes because i am putting
1:34a lot of eye shadows underneath my eyes
1:37I'm just going to take my NYC sunny bronzer and i'm going to use
1:40a little crease brush and I'm going to add this to my lid just to add some
1:44color to my eyelid
1:45so I'm focusing that on my outer V and then bring it into my crease
1:49I'm just going to continue to do this until I have the intensity that I want
1:54and I'm also going to be taking it a little bit past the crease as well
2:00ok
2:02yeah
2:05now i'm going to take this color called chaos from the palette
2:08and only small little angled brush I'm going to be adding some fixed plus and
2:12then dipping into the eye shadow and then i'm going to be using this kind of
2:16like gel eyeliner and I'm going to be creating a pretty thick wing with this i
2:21recommend dipping your brush into the powder first and then adding fix plus
2:26because this is a matte eyeshadow and it can get a little bit chunky if you add
2:29water to it so i recommend adding the pics + after you dip it into the shadow
2:39yeah
2:41so before i continue on with the wing really quick i'm gonna add some eyeliner
2:44this is the Urban Decay eyeliner in the color chaos and i'm using this to tight
2:50line and i'm also going to be adding this to my waterline as well
2:59ok so going back in to the chaos color i'm adding a little bit more fixed plus
3:032 just intensify it a bit and I'm going to be adding a thick wing and i suck at
3:08recording this because i always get out of focus and it's just a big hot mess
3:12but just add your wing just like you were adding gel eyeliner
3:18yeah
3:20kinda just went back into my bronzer and i added some more into my crease just to
3:24intensify it a little bit to give myself a little bit more color for my highlight
3:27I'm using the elf baked eye liner in moonlight and pressure is called
3:32moonstone when I don't know i have it down below and i am using this in my
3:36inner corner and underneath my brow bone as well i'm going to take the brush that
3:43came with the palette and I'm going to be dipping it into the color chaos and
3:47running that underneath my lower lash line but staying on the outer half of my
3:51I kind of stopping where the pupil is
3:54and by the way I didn't add any fixed plus to this part
4:04then going into this shade right here called gonzo i'm going to be taking it
4:07on the same brush and then adding it in the center of my lower lash line and
4:11then bring all the way towards my inner tear duct just to kind of have it fade
4:15from the light blue to the cold ball blue
4:19yeah
4:25then I'm going to flip the brush around and with no additional product I'm just
4:28gonna be blending on these colors just to make it a little bit more seamless
4:36then with that same brush I'm going to be putting it back into the gonzo shade
4:40and adding some more just to smoke it out and make it look like really blown
4:44out underneath the lower lash line
4:50and
4:53then take this color here called revolt and i'm just going to add this
4:57- my little tear duct area just to give it some pizzazz
5:01add some glitter and some I don't know you know yeah I don't know just for fun
5:06again i'm going to be using two different mascara i am using the
5:09maybelline colossal volume Express and the Maybelline rocket volume Express are
5:15also going to be using the rocket on my lower lash line as well
5:22for my lips I'm going to take maxima gentle lip liner and i'm going to fill
5:29in my lips with this which is a really nice and vibrant
5:32pinky purple
5:37yeah
5:38for my lipstick i am using the wet and wild my class lipstick and don't blink
5:42pink
5:46yeah
5:47and for my lip gloss i'm using the revlon colorburst lip gloss and adorned
5:51and that is it for this tutorial i hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for
5:56watching
5:57ok guys so basically i think this palette is phenomenal
6:03like it's absolutely amazing first of all i'm just going to talk about the
6:07packaging for a second because the packaging is incredible like is it
6:13they did such a good job with this packaging
6:16it's like a bunch of colorful smoke all over the palate and it's great and it's
6:21dirty and it's i am a mistake by the way so excuse the voice but it's sturdy and
6:27it's so durable I feel like like I feel like it's pretty durable and it comes
6:34with a gigantic mirror like seriously this mirror is so big it's great they
6:40love it
6:41now talking about the actual product these things are so intense
6:46these aren't just your basic eye shadows by the way these are pressed pigment so
6:50they aren't just your basic regular eye shadows there are 10 times more
6:54pigmented because they are pressed pigments
6:57so you're definitely getting amazing color payoff with this palette every
7:01single eyeshadow has fantastic color payoff everything what the pilot also
7:06comes with a double ended brush and it is actually really cute it's black and
7:11the bristles are purple
7:14so cute i use this throughout the entire tutorial in this video and i love it
7:18like I think it's a great great brush I see myself reaching for a lot even packs
7:23on color onto your lid beautifully
7:26people have been freaking out because there's a disclaimer on the packaging or
7:30on the box that some of these pigments in this palette are not used for your
7:35immediate I area and it is these 4 i'm pretty sure it's slow burn Savage
7:42urban and tilted the reddish the pink and the purple they say it's not for
7:47your immediate area but honestly that's very typical for pigments I've heard
7:51that so many times when it comes to pigments
7:54so when i read that it did
7:55really bother me I guess people just didn't realize that that was the case
7:59for some pigments
8:00I had never read it on any packaging but i've heard people like a mac tell me
8:04that so I mean it's no big deal if you are a little bit afraid
8:09just don't put them on like your waterline or anything like that but
8:12honestly I don't think your eyes will get irritated from it
8:15everybody has different skin so it will take my word for it but I used it on my
8:20eyes and i've used the Pink's on my eyes before and I haven't had any irritation
8:24personally and mom about sensitive skin so I mean I've been doing I've been
8:30going pretty fine with these i'm going to quickly swatch all of the colors on
8:34my arm so you can see how great and pigmented these things are ok so this is
8:40the most Awkward swatching i have ever done
8:44what possessed me to put them on the side of my arm
8:47no idea let's just roll that these are the colors look like they're insanely
8:52pigmented being pressed pigment of course this one is revolt it is a very
8:56intense shiny silvery color it does have a little bit of glitter in it like
9:01chunks of glitter but if you want this eyeshadow
9:04it goes on like liquid metal seriously it's not what right now this is how it
9:09normally swatches and it's still like gorgeous love it
9:14this one is gonzo right here it's a beautiful blue
9:17this one here is called slow burn and it is my second favorite color in the
9:20palette absolutely love it it's beautiful
9:23this one is your typical hot hot pink and this one is called savage and this
9:28one is matt this one has a little bit of glitter in it but like barely noticeable
9:33it definitely comes out Matt on your eyelid this right here is called fringe
9:37and it is a metallic teal type of color and it is seriously stunning on the lid
9:43this one is your typical cobalt blue and it is called chaos
9:47this one right here is called jilted it's also one of my favorites because it
9:50has a good dual chrome effect
9:52it looks pink
9:53and it looks purple in certain angles it's amazing
9:57this one right here is a nice deep purple and it is called urban this one
10:02right here it is called freak and it is just like an intense minty sort of minty
10:09green color and then this one is my absolute favorite one of the entire
10:14palette and it is called thrash and it is just like an intense lime green it's
10:19not even picking up how intense this color is in person like oh my god my
10:24favorite favorite favorite favorite
10:25so I hope this awkward angle of swatching helped you in some way
10:31by the way i do recommend using these colors with a primer underneath
10:36even though they are so intensely pigmented definitely use a primer
10:39because if you don't it will stay in your eyes like you put the pink on
10:43trying to get off and you're like oh god they're still pink on my lid
10:47so definitely is a primary want to use a primer there is no staining
10:51at least I don't detect any staining also if you want I shadows to be super
10:55super intense i recommend using a white base and now we'll just make them look
10:59crazy
11:01so anyway I hope you enjoyed this tutorial thank you so much for watching
0:16hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here
0:23I wanted to do something blue because i was really inspired by this palette
0:28right here this is the morphe 35o d
0:31I know that everybody's using the 3500 palette right now which is calling my
0:37name because it's full of oranges and those are my favorite kinds of colors
0:41but i thought you know what I'm going to step out of my comfort zone
0:44I'm not going to do an orange smokey eye today I'm going to do a blue one so I
0:48just focused on me blue colors in this palette this is a very pigmented palette
0:52pretty freaking amazing
0:54i will link it down below if you're interested so yes I think it's really
0:59pretty sometimes blue scared me and sometimes I feel like I can't pull it
1:02off but decided to run with it and if you want to see how to get this look
1:06then just keep watching
1:07ok so i've already primed my eyes with my Mac 24 hour extended I base and i did
1:13go into this palette as well not just the morphe palette this is the to face
1:18naturally matte palette because the morphe one lacks crease shade and stuff
1:23like that so i just applied that vanilla color on my entire lid - set the primer
1:27and now i'm going in with this one I believe it was called kashmir bunny on a
1:31fluffy brush and that's going to be my transition shade then I'm taking that
1:35really intense blue in the palette now this one does work a lot better with
1:39fix+ so I just sprayed some fixed plus on my brush this is an elf brush and I
1:45dipped it back into the eye shadow and then apply it like that onto my lid
1:50and so it can be really really really intense and frosty
1:55now i'm gonna take this matt navy blue and on this little pencil brush i'm just
1:59going to start applying this into my crease
2:02now this looks looks a little messy and sloppy before it looks good so you know
2:06just take your time with it I'm just putting this into my crease back and
2:10forth and trying to blend the shimmery blue with the matte blue then I'm going
2:15into this color called honey butter this is in the to face palette and on a
2:19fluffy crease brush
2:20I am just trying to blend out the harsh lines and then I'm going to do the same
2:23thing with chocolate crap just trying to blend everything into the crease this
2:28look requires a lot a lot of blending and I'm gonna go back into that blue i'm
2:34not going to spray fix+ but i'm just going to intensify the little bit more
2:38since you blend so much a lot of it does get blended away
2:42now i'm going into this other shimmery maybe blue the other one was like a mad
2:45navy blue this one's a shimmery one and i'm doing the same thing I did with the
2:49navy blue
2:51just make sure everything is nice and blended all the crease colors fade into
2:55each other back again with cashmere bunny and I am just further blending
3:00possible ending little living
3:03I'm gonna take this coastal scents brush and this matte black in the palette and
3:08I'm going to start packing this on the outer corners
3:10I want the drama to be like on the outer corner of the lid i wanted to go from
3:13like black to blue
3:15I'm just packing on that black and I guess I forgot I was filming tutorial
3:22but i just put that middle shade under my brow bone the same one I used on my
3:27lid ok so moving onto my face before I finish my eyes I am priming my face with
3:31the rebecca black light filter primarily this was called I'm obsessed with this I
3:35think it's amazing
3:37then I went in with the Loreal infallible Pro matte foundation in shell
3:41beige
3:42I will
3:42in this the number i have and i'm using this with a real techniques complexion
3:47sponge and I am just bouncing that on my whole face
3:50I love this foundation but i do need to use a very illuminating primer and a
3:53sponge with it because if not it looks too dry and cakey then underneath my
3:59eyes I decided to use my NARS creamy rating concealer i haven't used it in a
4:02hot minute so I'm using vanilla underneath my eyes and I'm also
4:06highlighting with this and I'm just blending everything out with the same
4:11real techniques sponge
4:17now i'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent setting powder and i'm just
4:21going to set my under eye concealer
4:24so moving onto my face again I mean my eyes
4:27this is max nylon eyeshadow it's a really intense color so i use that in my
4:31inner corners then I'm going to take this tart tart 'used gel liner cream
4:36liner thing and this is a little sigma brush and I'm taking this liner all the
4:41way into my inner corners like my inner tear duct as you can see and I'm
4:44dragging that on my waterline
4:46so not only am i doing a wing with this but I'm going to put it in my inner
4:49corners like a cat I Egyptian kind of effect and on my waterline and then I'm
4:54just going to do a little flick and this is the Too Faced better than sex mascara
4:58and for my bottom lashes I wanted a blue color I thought it would look really
5:02cool
5:03so this is the they're real mascara by benefit in their blue shade and its
5:06really really cool i like how it turned out I think it's different
5:09I didn't put any eyeshadow on my lower lashes just for a little bit of a change
5:12and then I put on some falsies those were the morphe demi wispies so to
5:18contour me to do a soft contour with my girl lactic Kabul bronzer
5:22this is a morph e.g something brush from the gun metal collection it's their
5:26powder brush and I'm just using this brush because it does apply a soft
5:30amount like a light amount of product so I'm just contouring and bronzing with
5:34that
5:35for my highlight i am using color pops wisp highlight
5:39it's beautiful and I love applying this with a sponge i can apply it with a
5:43synthetic brush too but i really like how the sponge applies it
5:50i'm also highlighting my nose
5:54you know ok so for blush I'm using the clinique nude pop blush pop
6:14for my lips I'm taking color pops lip liner in BFF and i'm just going to line

0:11hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here
0:16I love these kind of looks where it's like gray eyes and great lips I know
0:20that's like a very big trend
0:22I wanted to do a makeup tutorial surrounding the Anasazi liquid lipstick
0:25in sepia
0:27it looks so much darker on me that it doesn't everyone else I feel but it's
0:31okay i like it and i used mostly the Kat Von D shade and light palette
0:36I really love these type of looks where you match like eyes and lips together
0:39especially these gray tones and it's kind of weird for me to do this because
0:42i don't have mascara on my lower lash line
0:45I always smoked out my lower lashes and put on mascara and I didn't do that for
0:49today's video i wanted to switch it up and I don't know I don't know anyway if
0:54you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
0:57so the first thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids as usual this is Mac's
1:02painterly Paint Pot and I'm bluffing that out with a zoe book concealer brush
1:07now i'm going to go into the Kat Von D shade and light palette and I'm taking
1:10this whitish kind of color i don't have the palate with me because it's in
1:14storage at the moment but i'm just going to walk you through the colors this is
1:18like a whiter shade and I just set that bass down
1:22this is a Luxy crease brush and I'm applying that really really really light
1:27bone beige like grayish color and i'm applying this into my crease as my
1:31transition shade
1:32now i'm taking max copper plates eyeshadow it's just a neutral gray and
1:37this is a morphe brush
1:39and i'm just applying this on the outer corners of my really close to that tape
1:44and slightly bringing it in
1:46like slowly bringing in it I'm going to take this dark great in the palette with
1:50that same brush and I'm just going to do the exact same thing
1:53I'm just taking a bunch of great tone eyeshadow and creating like a gradient
1:58effect from the tape going to my inner corners so that's what I'm doing again
2:03same thing you know packing it on the outer corners and bringing it in slowly
2:07now i'm going into the black of the palette and on a different more dense
2:11precise brush
2:12I am packing this really really really close to the tape
2:16I want the black to just be focused on the very outer like corners like the cat
2:20eye shape that effect
2:22so I'm packing that black really close to the tape as adjusted
2:27then I'm going to take that same color use first and i'm just applying this to
2:31my in your corners so that it could just look a little bit brighter on my lid and
2:36then i'm applying that to my brow bone and in my tear duct as well just to
2:40highlight those parts in my eyes
2:42I have a cold by the way if you can tell i use that nyx eyeliner or use it like
2:48every tutorial it's my favorite from the drugstore and I tight line and what and
2:52added that to my waterline and then I just use my makeup forever graphic liner
2:56to create a very very small wing to prime my face i use the backup backlight
3:01primer and then for foundation
3:04i am using the urban decay naked skin foundation and i'm using it on a cover
3:08effects custom foundation brush so I'm just popping in this brush is really
3:13really cool it's so incredibly dense so it gives you really good coverage like
3:18it doesn't drink up
3:20barely any of the foundation it's pretty cool i really get so I'm just noting
3:24that in too much
3:29so I'm adding concealer underneath my eyes now and this is the Maybelline
3:33instant age rewind dark circle eraser and then in the shade fair i believe and
3:38i'm just applying that underneath my eyes and then blending that in but
3:41you've seen me blend this about a million times so let's just skip over
3:44them to set my concealer i'm using the laura mercier translucent setting powder
3:49and this is a real techniques setting brush
3:55and then I just plopped on some mascara i left my lower lashes bear that might
3:58seem really weird for some people but I thought it was cool and different so I
4:02applied my Too Faced better than sex mascara and now i'm going to contour
4:06very very slightly and very naturally with the a cosmetics contour kit and I
4:12use that shade in the middle and I'm just slightly contouring with this
4:16I don't want anything too heavy
4:24for blush I'm using one of my favorite blushes during this time like this time
4:28of year and it's tart expose the blush and i'm using this on a blush brush from
4:33morphe from their gun metal collection now to highlight I'm using the overflow
4:38shimmering strips in the shade illuminating and i'm using that very
4:42very top strip to highlight my face out my phone , texas to highlight my face
4:48and I'm using this on an M 501 brush my morphe and then to finish off my look

0:27hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm
0:34wearing right now it is a very warm look and i know that i do warm looks all the
0:39time on my channel
0:40they're my favorite looks to do especially in the summertime i love
0:44really warm bronzy looks but this look is a little bit different because I
0:48paired it with a bold lip and usually i pair my smoky eyes with nude lips you
0:52can definitely do this look and then pair it with a nude lip if you're more
0:55comfortable with that I know this is a little bit loud for some people wanted
0:58to do something different in terms of my lips usually my tutorials always end up
1:02with no lips so I wanted to change it up the slip i think it's so summery because
1:06it's a red neon lit but it has a little bit of orange undertone and it's so
1:10pretty i love it
1:11for those of you who are sick of all my warm tutorials don't worry i'm planning
1:14on doing a lot of tutorials with the lorac Pro palette 2 a little bit more
1:19cool toned looks though yeah i really hope you guys like this look and if you
1:24want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
1:27so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to prime my eyelids i am using
1:30my LA girl Pro conceal primer no concealer no primer i'm using this to
1:35prime my eyes because it is a full coverage product and it's just going to
1:38cover up all the redness and beans on my lids now I'm going to take my makeup
1:44eyeshadow in the shape peach smoothie and on a more feed fluffy brush I'm just
1:49going above this into my crease and just pretty much put it everywhere because
1:52it's gonna be my transition chain and it's going to give it a beautiful peach
1:55look now I'm going to take makeup geeks creme brulee and on a smaller blending
2:00brush I'm going to be doing the exact same thing only
2:03I'm not going to be too messy was it i'm going to be a little bit more precise
2:06and adding this directly in my crease and on the outer half of my eye
2:12yeah
2:18now i'm just going to take a warm orange shade this is just an orange eyeshadow
2:22in my naturally pretty palette from it cosmetics and on my mac 217 i'm going to
2:26be very very precise with this color a little bit more precise and creme brulee
2:30and i'm going to be putting this pretty much just like the hollow of my crease
2:34and on the outer be of my eye as well
2:48next I'm going to take my tart Park Avenue princess bronzer this and stab
2:52myself in the eye
2:53this is the shimmery one and i'm just going to pack this on my entire lid
2:56honestly any shimmery bronzer will do you can even skip this step I just
3:01wanted to add a little bit more dimension to the center of the lid since
3:04most of the colors are in the crease and the outer V of the eye but you don't
3:08have to do this step now I'm going to take mocha by makeup geek and it's a
3:15beautiful dark brown color I love this eyeshadow and on a flat shader brush i'm
3:20just going to be applying this really really close to my top lashes to kind of
3:24make like a very subtle eyeliner look I wanted to look deeper and like chocolate
3:30here towards the eyelashes and make it blown out towards the crease if that
3:35makes any sense really quickly I'm going to move on to the rest of my face before
3:39I finish my eyes I'm going to use my tart primed and poreless primer and I'm
3:43gonna put this all over my face
3:46well on the areas where I want to cover up my pores or to hide them or global or
3:50whatever
3:51now i'm using my revlon colorstay foundation into 5240 fresh i don't i
3:58don't exactly remember i will put it in the description box and this foundation
4:02is darker than my face but it matches the rest of my body so I am self tanning
4:06at the moment so that's why my faces a little bit wider than the rest of my
4:10body I'm going to use my boo cover up concealer and i'm going to use this to
4:15cover up my dark circles and to highlight my face as well
4:21I'm just blending that out with my Real Techniques contour brush
4:33yeah
4:39now i'm going to use macs emphasize powder and on my ELF tapered brush I'm
4:45just gonna pack that underneath my lashes to set my concealer underneath my
4:50lashes no no underneath my eyes to set my under eye concealer and set the rest
4:57of my concealer as well moving back to the eyes i'm just going to take mocha
5:03again into the exact same thing i did earlier only making it a little bit
5:06darker this time and then i'm going to sweep my brush back and forth just to
5:12blend it out and it can look kind of like a sunset there goes darker to
5:15lighter
5:19now i'm going to be using my milani shadow eyes and I'm gonna use this to
5:22run it on the waterline and then i'm going to go in with Max no makeup geeks
5:29is wrong created a makeup geeks creme brulee and i'm just going to apply this
5:34underneath my lashes and really really blow it out i'm going to smoke it out i
5:37wanted to look very very smoky on the lower lash line and I'm gonna take mocha
5:41again and i'm going to set that cream product i put in my waterline now I have
5:46been putting a shadow in my waterline for years and years and years and years
5:50and it's never irritated by I don't have sensitive eyes but if you have sensitive
5:53eyes and don't do this but I'm just gonna set that so it kind of makes like
5:58a nice brown eyeliner and the powder is just going to make it set and stay all
6:04day now i'm going to go in with this milani eyeshadow in the shade fellowship
6:09on and i'm going to apply this underneath my brow bone it is the most
6:12beautiful color has a gold undertone and I'm going to put this in my inner tear
6:17duct as well i'm applying some mascara to my bottom lashes and i'm getting them
6:23really really good because I want them to be very very like voluminous on my
6:27bottom lashes and i am using my Elizabeth mock it's so big mascara and
6:31then i'm going to apply some to the top lashes as well because i will be going
6:34in with some falsies i'm using my red cherry 747 ends and then i am going to
6:39apply them to my lashes so finishing off with my face i'm using my NARS Laguna
6:43bronzer on my ELF complexion brush and I'm just gonna be warming up my face I'm
6:48not adding blush so I want my face to be very very warm and bronzy but I'm really
6:52focusing this bronzer on my cheekbones I want it to be like very intense on my
6:59cheeks and you can see not like very intense but I want them to stand out my
7:04cheekbones so i'm applying a lot of the bronzer there
7:10now i'm gonna add my highlight and i'm using my Sigma contours to add it and
7:16I'm taking my fellowship on eyeshadow again and I'm going to use this as a
7:19base highlight this is so amazing to highlight your cheekbones because of
7:23that gold undertone almost goddess is so beautiful and the goddess like in
7:27summary i love it so much like my new favorite highlighter now it's so
7:31beautiful so that is what i'm doing and i'm going to take it on the bridge of my
7:34nose and on my upper lip and you know all the beautiful closest so for my lips
7:41the coolest part of this tutorial i am taking my milani anti feathering the
7:46pencil thing and I'm gonna put that on my lips and then I'm going to add some
7:50concealer to my lips so that the lip color will look more true to its color
7:55because my lips are very pigmented so the color that's on my lips is the lime
8:00crime Velveteen and suede very this stuff is no joke it's a beautiful hot
8:05neon orange II read it comes off more neon in person like a lot more neon and
8:10person it's just absolutely beautiful and it lasts all day on the lips i
8:14seriously had to get like makeup remover to take this off my lips because like
8:18cement on your face it's great if you want something that will last all day so
8:23that is the finished look guys I really hope you enjoyed this video thank you
8:27guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and
8:29I'll see you next time
0:11hey guys so today's video is going to be a prompt tutorial and i know that a
0:16couple of you guys have already had your prom and I'm so sorry I'm super late but
0:21I know some of you haven't had your prompt so
0:24better late than never hopefully so yeah let's get started I'm going to be using
0:28my Too Faced shadow insurance to prime my eyes
0:31this one keeps my action on for a really long time so it's pretty crucial for
0:35prom
0:36i'm going to add a face so that my eyeshadows can stand out a little bit
0:39more and i'm using the Milani shadow I in golden bronze
0:43I'm going to go into this eyeshadow from Mac called naked lunch and a flat shader
0:49brush I'm going to apply this to my entire lid
0:53I'm a little sick guys a number of the recipe I'm going to take some tape and
0:57apply that to the side of my eye to create a nice cat eye effect and then
1:01i'm going to go into max soft brown and i'm going to love this into my crease
1:05and just working that color back and forth
1:10yeah
1:13yeah
1:17I'm going to go into the shape called copper plate this is also from mac and
1:20i'm going to be doing the exact same thing I actually like how these two
1:23colors look together
1:25there's something about the cool tone and deform tones that I think look
1:28really nicely paired together then taking a dark chocolatey shade this is
1:33brown down from Mac I'm just going to build this color slowly onto my outer be
1:38and just drag it into my crease and a little bit on my lid as well
1:43this I look does take a lot of blending so you just want to go back and forth
1:48with the eyeshadow just apply a little by little and not get too heavy handed
1:52with it
1:57yeah
1:58then I'm going to take this pigment from makeup geek it is called a stir well and
2:02it's absolutely amazing and a flat shader brush I'm going to apply this on
2:06to the center of my lid dragging it towards my inner tear duct I'm just
2:16going to take any matte black eyeshadow and i'm going to be doing the exact same
2:19thing I did with the chocolate brown color only focusing the black a little
2:24bit more towards the tape and not so much on my entire is that makes any
2:28sense
2:28just dragging that a little bit into my crease but focusing most of the black
2:33color right at the tape so that it does have a nice transition
2:38I'm gonna take this gel eyeliner from Maybelline this one lasts a really long
2:43time on my island that's why it would be perfect for prom and then I'm just going
2:47to add a thin line
2:49I don't want anything too thick so that it doesn't overpower my entire I and
2:54don't worry about a perfect little wing because the tape does act as a perfect
2:59little guide so that you don't mess up then I'm just going to go back into the
3:02black eyeshadow and just intensify the black a little bit more packing most of
3:08the black
3:09like I said towards the tape and I'm just going to take the tape off and then
3:14I'm going to go into max shroom
3:16and i'm going to use this as my inner corner highlight
3:19yeah
3:21underneath my brow bone i am just taking a random white matte eyeshadow and
3:27applying this underneath my brow bone
3:30i'm going to be doing my eyebrows next and I like priming my eyebrows with
3:34eyeshadow primer when I want them to last all day which is what you would
3:39want for prom
3:40I have an entire eyebrow tutorial that i will link down below if you're
3:43interested
3:44is this would take way too much time I'm gonna move on to the rest of my face and
3:49Prime with my Maybelline Baby skin applying it on the places where I think
3:53I needed the most
3:55I'm going to take a photo friendly foundation
3:58mine is the urban decay naked skin this has no SPF so it looks amazing in
4:03pictures which is ideal for prom and i'm just going to buff this all over my face
4:09using a Real Techniques buffing brush
4:13yeah
4:30next I'm going to conceal my under eyes and I recommend using a full coverage
4:34long-lasting can see their mind would be the mac pro longwear it last
4:41literally all day and it is full coverage but when I want to go film this
4:45tutorial it was nowhere to be found so I'm just using the Maybelline fit me
4:49concealer just for the sake of this video but i definitely recommend one
4:53that will last all night long and it is pretty good coverage and my program
4:58where is perfect for that but this will do for the sake of this video and I'm
5:02just buffing that out with the Real Techniques contour brush
5:12yeah
5:19i'm going to set everything on my face using my Mac msf natural and shade
5:23medium
5:23I love this powder because it is very finely milled and it does not look cakey
5:28on the skin whatsoever
5:30so you're not going to look like you have a lot of powder on your face
5:37and to set my under eye can see there i'm using this powder called emphasize
5:41is also for mac I'm sorry and I'm using like a lot of mac in this video I don't
5:47know I didn't even realize it while I was filming but i'm just going to set my
5:50under eye concealer with this powder then to finish off my eyes
5:53I'm going to take a q-tip and run that on my waterline just take out any of the
5:57excess oils and the pencil that i'm using right here will last a lot longer
6:01i'm using my chela I release highlighter
6:04this is just going to open up the eyes your eyes don't look really really small
6:08or harsh which is what putting black on your waterline tends to do then I'm just
6:13going to take that brown color and apply it to my lower lash line and then with a
6:17pencil brush i'm just going to buff it all out so it looks nice and smoky
6:22I'm going to use my clinic bottom lash mascara this makes my bottom lashes look
6:27nice and dramatic which is what i want for prom and then I'm going to be adding
6:31falsies next
6:32so I'm just going to apply a very thin coat of mascara using be enabling rocket
6:37volume Express the false is amusing are the arts all natural demi wispies these
6:42are my favorite ones even though i am not a fall / where you guys know this
6:46but those are my favorite ones when I do wear false lashes
6:49I'm going to take my benefit through the bronzer and my Sigma contour brush and
6:54I'm going to contour my cheekbones with this bronzer i definitely recommend
6:58contouring for prom especially because I just gives shape and dimension to your
7:03face and it looks nicer in photos
7:06- I'm just going to contour my cheekbones my temples my forehead
7:13a little bit on the sides of my nose and then I'm going to take my NARS Laguna
7:18bronzer and on a bigger brush and I'm just going to bronze up my face a little
7:22bit more just to give more color to my face
7:29yeah
7:35then I'm gonna take that onto my chest as well just a little bit more bronze
7:39and glowy the blush I'm using is this one by nicks and it is called mall and I
7:45love this blush i think it complements so many different looks and I'm going to
7:50be applying that with my it cosmetics blush brush the highlight I'm using is
7:57this 1 by L and it is called blush gems and i'm just an added to the tops of my
8:01cheekbones and on the bridge of my nose
8:05sorry and on my Cupid's bow a little bit
8:12I'm gonna do a nude lip but i'm going to do a more brownie darker nude lip
8:18this is what a wild bear it all and i'm going to do a darker nude because very
8:24pale nude tend to look white in flash photography so you don't want to look
8:28like you have no slips at prom huh
8:30and then I'm just going to take my buxom white russian lip gloss and apply this
8:36on top
8:37I love this lip gloss because it lasts a really really long time on my lips and
8:41it does give up a beautiful glossy finish
8:44so it is perfect for plum that completes this makeup tutorial i hope you guys

0:38what I'm doing it and then I realized

0:42i get so many compliments on how green
0:45my eyes look anytime I wear red tone
0:47eyeshadows are very warm eyeshadows I
0:49get complimented on how green my eyes

0:57totally do this look but this is a great
0:59way for those of you with green eyes to

1:14anything so yes
1:15anyway if you want to see how to get
1:17this look then just keep watching
1:19ok so I've already applied my foundation
1:20and concealer and my powder just because
1:23i feel like i do that in every single
1:25look and I don't want it to be too
1:27repetitive or too boring but i'm wearing
1:29the Urban Decay all nighter foundation
1:31and whatever i'm wearing will be listed
1:33below so i'm going to put my hair back i
1:36recently purchased this you guys know I
1:38like to wear these little headbands when
1:40I film tutorials this is the one that I
1:42always wear i have put it away for the
1:44spring and summer and I was wearing like
1:45the flower pink one but I'm bringing
1:47this bad boy back out and i love it
1:50i have purchased this one with this one
1:51hurts my head like I mean I have a big
1:54head and this is like so tight I don't
1:57know I guess I were a few times and
1:59maybe my big ol handle stretch it out
2:00but you guys don't care i know i'm just
2:03i'm just don't know I'm chatty today
2:05ok so I'm just gonna go ahead and get
2:06started I am busting out the mastery
2:09palette by Julius place and all I did in
2:12my sep tember favorites video was just
2:13take all the matte shades and i just
2:16threw them on my eyes so on a fluffy
2:18crease brush this is the NARS crease
2:19brush it says number 42 at the bottom
2:22i'm going to take the shade
2:24burkina right here and I'm going to
2:26focus this on my lid I'm not really
2:28gonna bring it up to the crease
2:30oh wait let me zoom in even though i am
2:32using a crease brush I really don't want
2:34it to get too far up on my lid
2:37i'm just using a crease brush to really
2:39blend and buff everything else focusing
2:43it really really close to my lashes and
2:45then dragging it up and buffing it out i
2:47use my concealer to prime my eyelids
2:57and then I start to slowly drag some of
3:00that into the crease
3:05it's going to look a little bit messy
3:07but that is the look we're going for
3:09it's a very messy smoky daytime look I
3:14mean you could totally wear this in the
3:15nighttime as well this is definitely not
3:17something that's just for the daytime
3:26now i'm going to go in with a clean
3:28blending brush this is the morphe 23 i'm
3:31going to buff out those edges i do not
3:34want too much pigmentation here in the
3:37crease
3:41now i'm going to take the shade zoo
3:44right here which is a very very warm
3:46almost red-brown i'm going to take the
3:48morphe thirteen brush I know that these
3:51are discontinued but i know so many of
3:54you guys have them already and I'm
3:57pretty much just applying this color
3:59really really close to the lashes and
4:01doing the same thing just dragging it up
4:03a little bit but I'm not going to take
4:04it as far as I took the shade burkina
4:16now on an even smaller little fluffy
4:18brush this is the Real Techniques
4:20shading brush I'm going to take this
4:22shay right here called ADA or add up
4:24it's very similar to the shade we just
4:26used but this one is a little bit more
4:29red and I'm going to do the exact same
4:31thing focusing this one even closer to
4:35my lashline and then the other shade so
4:37we're pretty much doing like a gradient
4:39you want your shades to fade from like
4:41darkest to lightest
4:52then I'm gonna go back in with that
4:54fluffy brush we first use and go back
4:56into that first shade we used and I'm
4:58just gonna blend on top of it and I know
5:05it's a little bit repetitive but we're
5:07going to do the exact same thing all
5:08over again i'm going to apply the shade
5:11Zulu once more on my lid there is a
5:15little bit of fallout with this palette
5:17as well as you can see there's kind of
5:19like some brown eyeshadow underneath
5:21which is why I always always do my
5:24eyeshadow first sometimes I'll do my
5:26face makeup first like today but i
5:28always recommend doing eyeshadow first
5:31and then i'm going to go back into the
5:32shada with the same brush and do the
5:35same thing for some reason a lot of
5:39people always tell me like why is your
5:41eye makeup before your face you're not
5:43supposed to do that you're supposed to
5:45do your face makeup first and I don't
5:47get why people get so upset about it
5:48like where is the handbook tell me where
5:50its sense that I have to do my face
5:52makeup first please tell me it's just
5:54personal preference doesn't mean you're
5:57doing it right or doing it out of order
5:59do your makeup the way you want to if
6:00you want to draw on one eyebrows and do
6:02your whole face and then draw this one
6:04who says you can I like to put on my
6:06makeup first because i like to avoid the
6:09fallout on my own foundation
6:11ok so i am going to go back in with a
6:12few more eyeshadows in a second but I
6:14want to work on my lower lashline i'm
6:16going to use the exact same shade i
6:18already use on my top lid gonna take
6:20burkina first I have no idea if I'm
6:22pronouncing that work correctly doesn't
6:24sound like i am i'm going to apply it
6:26using this urban decay brush number eat
6:28208
6:32then I'm going to take the shade Zulu
6:37followed by a little bit of ADA i'm
6:39going to use the Luxy 217 brush to
6:42smudge both of these out dippin into a
6:50dup data and getting really really
6:53really close with this shade
7:00I love looks like this because they
7:02really take no skill and even though
7:04they look a little crazy weird now with
7:07eyeliner or a ton of mascara it just
7:09looks like edgy and smoky and it was
7:12like the easiest i would ever
7:17now i'm going to take the colour-pop
7:20crumb gel liner in the shade mr. Bing i
7:23love this eyeliner it just intensifies
7:25any brown smokey eye and I just love how
7:28it makes green eyes look even brown eyes
7:30I feel like mr. being emphasizes like
7:33the golden tones in your eyes if you
7:35have brown eyes
7:36awesome for blue eyes as well gonna play
7:40a little
7:49so the look in my September favorites
7:52video wasn't as red as it is now I did
7:55apply some more brown colors so I took
7:58the shape fulani say that
8:01rambla not fulani for LAN Jie and on
8:05this same Real Techniques brush I'm
8:07going to apply that really really close
8:09I'm also going to put that on my little
8:14girl Ashley
8:19then I thought okay I want to even a
8:22little bit less red because i really
8:24wanted to match my lip color but I don't
8:26want to clash so on this little brush
8:28this is the wave of 237 brush i took
8:32this eyeshadow this is the make up for
8:33ever and 618 but any dark brown
8:37eyeshadow you have in your collection i
8:38know you have one that will work taking
8:40a bit of this and smudging that super
8:43close to the lashes like super-close
8:46because this I shot up his and dent
9:01now i'm going to take this shade right
9:03here called Giza and on this milani
9:06crease brush I'm going to put that on my
9:08inner corners for my brow bone highlight
9:13because the masquerade pilot doesn't
9:15really have a very very light satin
9:18color I'm going to take my essence pure
9:20nude highlight which I'm gonna end up
9:22using on my face and I'm taking the
9:24morphe am 210 brush and I'm going to use
9:27this to highlight my browbone i'm giving
9:35my eyelashes a really good curl because
9:37i am not applying eyeliner or false
9:41lashes so I really want my mascara to
9:43stand out this is the tweezerman eyelash
9:45curlers and now i'm going to apply a lot
9:47of this this is the superhero mascara by
9:51it cosmetics very volumizing very black
9:54i'm going to apply a ton of this company
10:00that is it can get a little bit clumpy
10:01if you use too much what I like to do
10:04when my eyelashes start to stick
10:06together is I'll take this i love this
10:08is like my little trustee guy this is
10:11the morphe beat 71 and I'll just comb
10:14through my eyelashes and it really does
10:19a good job of getting rid of those clubs
10:20so I'm just going to apply mascara to
10:23the rest of my lashes and i will be
10:25right back to finish my face
10:27ok so now we're completely done with the
10:29eyes so so so so easy now I'm going to
10:32contour my face a little bit i know in
10:34my favorites video i was wearing the

11:23don't lose interest in it the way that I
11:25lost interest in scandal
11:26I know no company but i did lose
11:28interest in scandal just because I was
11:30like going back and forth like who does
11:32she love hood and it just it was driving
11:34me nuts so i'm going to take the wet and
11:36wild color icon bronzer in ticket to
11:39Brazil it's a very warm shimmery bronzer
11:42and i'm just going to use this to warm
11:44up the skin a little bit i was also
11:45wearing this in my favorites video using
11:47these wava 90 brush it's like they're
11:50baked powder brush puffed-up helped up
11:56ok so for blush I'm going to use the
12:01bombs blush in the shade Palm Beach this
12:03is a very long wearing blush and i agree
12:06this this like last a long time on my
12:08skin taking my makeup forever 122 brush
12:11it's just a stippling brush I like
12:13stippling brushes for blush like any
12:15stippling brush because i feel like it
12:17applies blush a little bit more
12:19naturally you don't have to make up for
12:21everyone this is like overpriced elf has
12:23a really really nice stippling brush
12:24that I love
12:25morphy Sigma
12:31ok so now i'm going to highlight my face
12:33using the highlight I use underneath my
12:36brow bone the essence . highlighter this
12:39stuff is so affordable and so good it
12:41looks so natural on the skin just going
12:44to apply some of that to the tops of my
12:46cheekbones using these away ba11 for
12:50brush and then before i sat down to fill
13:01my favorites video i popped on a little
13:03bit of this guy right here this is my
13:04makeup geek kathleenlights highlighter
13:06palette
13:07oh i have been using this in my videos
13:08because I don't want to like shove it
13:10down your throat I don't like doing that
13:11too much but I took a little bit of
13:13night light and I put that right at the
13:16top right here like only right there
13:22booth and then i'm also going to take
13:26some of that put it in my inner corners
13:29because I want my inner corners to look
13:30a little bit more golden so yeah this
13:34point you can throw on a nude lip and I
13:36think it would look amazing but since
13:38this is the lip color i was wearing my
13:39favorite video i'm gonna pop this on and
13:41honestly I always tell people who have
13:43green eyes to try to embrace red
13:45lipstick because i think that green eyes
13:48match really well with lipstick the red
13:50really just pulls out the green even
13:52when I wear like red clothing people
13:54compliment how green my eyes look at
13:56know but I'm gonna go in with the kat
13:57von d everlasting liquid lipstick in the
13:59shade project chimps this was limited
14:02edition but a few of you guys told me
14:03it's still available on the kat von d
14:06website and if you do purchase this i
14:08think all proceeds or a portion of the
14:10proceeds go to help the chimps i'm just
14:12going to apply this to my mouth
14:22ok so i just applied to four layers of
14:25this it is a little bit streaky not
14:28streaky it's a little bit thin of a
14:30formula so if you do just 14 layer it
14:33won't be streaky but it'll be a lighter
14:34red I wanted it to be a little bit
14:36darker like this so i did two layers so
14:39yes that completes this makeup look I
14:41think it's so pretty for green eyes or
14:43for any eye color you have whatever your
14:45eye color is I like this look regardless
14:47but if you do have green eyes and you've
14:49been searching for a way to make them
14:50stand out in your makeup i think this is
14:52a good way to go
14:54yes secondly this video and i hope you
14:55guys enjoyed thank you so much for
14:57watching please subscribe if you haven't
14:59already and I will see you in my next
15:00video bye
0:13so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right now
0:18I cut myself cleaning my food processor this morning
0:21so this is the look that I've been wearing a lot recently just not on my
0:24videos because as you guys know I've been pre-recording a lot but I've worn
0:29this look
0:30three times in the past week and that's saying a lot because I like to like
0:33we're different things but honestly I think this look is perfect for fall if
0:38you are a simple gal I think we like to wear like a lot less makeup in the
0:42summer and we really to glam it up in the fall time so I did a little bit more
0:47than i would normally do as an everyday look during the summer this is a lot of
0:51makeup for some people for an everyday look
0:53but I think it's perfect for fall because it's just like a little bit
0:57vampy been natural at the same time i don't know i really like it and it's
1:01something that you can wear all the time and just switch up the lip color you
1:04could do a dark red or brown
1:07mmm i would have had way too much coffee today and I'm like and you can tell
1:14ok so if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
1:17ok so i'm taking my hair out of my face in my little headband here i'm going to
1:22take the Smashbox BB water i'm in the shade light you have to shake it up
1:26first and then i'm applying this to my face
1:28this is a Sephora Pro air brush brush I'm not even sure the name but it was in
1:32that limited edition packaging with the flowers
1:36i'm just applying that to my entire face I skipped primer when i use that because
1:39I find that I don't really need to
1:41this is the Maybelline
1:44what is this called the better skin concealer there you go
1:49I applied that underneath my eyes to highlight and to cover up my circles and
1:54then i apply that to the rest of my face as I normally do this is the sedona lace
1:58217 brush my holy grail concealer brush and I'm just blending all of that in
2:04this is the it cosmetics bye bye pores powder the press version i love this so
2:11I'm just taking the real techniques setting brush and I'm setting my under
2:14eye concealer
2:17yeah
2:23now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm using the Maybelline 24 hour cream
2:27eyeshadow in the shade creamy beige
2:29this came out with like their letters collection but i still see it all the
2:32time and i'm just applying that to my entire lid i just wanted a hint of color
2:37but not something that was really noticeable
2:39I like doing this for like an everyday look and then i'm applying some of that
2:43underneath my lower lashes with this fluffy brush for mascara I'm using this
2:50one by clinic
2:51it's like their chubby fat mascara but this is a red shade like a red color and
2:56I think it's so cool like so nice for a fall because it's a deep primary shade
3:00and you can tell it just gives like a slight hint
3:03you can't unless you look really close but I think it's cool so now to finish
3:07up my face
3:08that's all I do with the eyes I'm using the elf mineral bronzer and i'm going to
3:13use this to contour
3:14I don't exactly remember the name of this brush but it's like a morphy blush
3:19brush
3:20now i'm going to apply some blush this is like a bronzer and blush in one
3:25this is benefits Dallas box powder blush thing it's like a really pretty
3:30mob color it's so nice this time of year I always busted out in the fall time
3:36it's beautiful
3:37so for highlight I'm using Becca's champagne pop and I'm just barely
3:41putting this on the tops of my cheekbones I don't want to look too
3:43glowy
3:44but just a little bit of something something and now i'm moving on to my
3:49lips and this is the star of the show you can change up your lip color for an
3:52everyday because this
3:53I look goes with everything but this is color pops Libby stick in the shade
3:57grunge and then that completes make a book i really hope you guys enjoyed
4:02please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is going to be a top through tutorial kind of excited
0:05to do one because i haven't done one in a while I haven't actually done a
0:07tutorial in a while because you guys know and then painting and I've actually
0:12had to film videos that were super easy to film like just reviews or talking
0:18kind of videos
0:19um let's talk about something really good so I got new lights and actually
0:25like my lighting is completely off in this video I don't know if you guys
0:28could tell it looks bad in the viewfinder and probably looks bad to you
0:32guys
0:32highlighting is completely off because i had told you guys in a previous video
0:36that i had a ring light and then I broke it so i thought that the only thing that
0:40broke with the bowl because the bulb shattered into a million pieces so i
0:44purchased a new bowl
0:46so I want to go put the bulb inside the ring light and it was there and it was
0:49perfect on like a beautiful and i want to plug it in and it didn't work so it
0:54wasn't the bulb something was coming is completely wrong with my ring light
0:58actually called the people i told the situation and I was still under warranty
1:03so i have to send it out tomorrow
1:06they have to have to get it they have to see what's wrong with it
1:10and if there's something wrong that they can't fix they will send me a new one
1:14so that's probably going to take like two weeks that's really like a two-week
1:18process to be honest so i'll probably be filming my videos at nighttime
1:22because it's night time right now which is what I mean it was probably feeling
1:25my videos facing the mirror like I always do until i get my ring light in
1:30the mail because like the lighting is really bad right now but anyway today's
1:34video is going to be a tutorial talk to do and i think i'm just going to do like
1:40a combination of looks I've been wearing in my previous videos I'm going to do
1:44the I look I'm going to use my too faced natural matte palette
1:48this is what it looks like a little bit it's kind of like the look I was wearing
1:52in the review only without the blue and black
1:54to add the blue i'm just going to use this palette and this pellet alone so I
1:58actually going to start out with my face
2:01I never start out of my face but why not much i'm gonna figure out here
2:07by the way there's still an echo in this room like a hardcore echo and I don't
2:13know what else to do i open the window i put a rug I put my friends are in here
2:17maybe two blenders on the other side of the room anyway so I don't exactly know
2:22what to do
2:24I'm still going to get more furniture i have to put in like another furniture
2:27unit in this room
2:28it's because i have hardwood floors in here outside i open up a window to see
2:34if that would help but I don't know if i should get a bigger rug like a more
2:38fluffy rug or just put like a bunch more things on the wall
2:41I don't know i have a mic so i bought a mic for the echo in my last room and
2:48seemed to work but for some reason in this room is just ok so I'm going to
2:52find my face using my favorite primer in the entire world this is the hangover or
2:58xor hangover x4 planishing face primer i love this because it has coconut water
3:03electrolytes probiotics
3:05I really like it because it hydrates my face most importantly so it's kind of
3:09like a primer and moisturize our all-in-one and I really really love it
3:15all the girls like my band-aid
3:19I was actually setting up the lights a little while ago and I got it clamped my
3:25arm and I was like bleeding and it was traumatic
3:29I'm gonna add some radiance to my face because the foundation I'm using I kind
3:34of really have to be doing for it to look good but i still really love it so
3:38i'm going to use it and i'm using the body shop
3:40radiant hi later i got this at the body shop store in california and i really
3:45like it's just like a champagne me pink color
3:49it's really pretty on top of the cheekbones but actually really like it
3:52underneath my makeup as well
3:54ok so the foundation I'm using is the brand new foundation to cover effects
3:59like they just came out with this and this was sent to me actually have an
4:03efficient if I can call Corey a friend
4:06hi Cory if you're watching but i have a friend sort of who works over at cover
4:10of X and sometimes sends me like new products and i love this foundation i
4:15tried out for the first time yesterday and i really like it and usually I do
4:20not like foundations like this because it's like a serum eat kind of foundation
4:24kinda like the Bearskin one from bareMinerals hated it the physicians
4:28formula once in a dropper hated it
4:30I don't like Sierra me things they don't stick wall on my dry skin but this one
4:35if I hydrate actually love the finish
4:38I have mine
4:39g30 it's their cover effects custom cover drops
4:42I love eat just comes out like a dropper like this
4:46I just dropped them on the back of my hand Oh
4:50too much has too much super runny you can see you have to shake it really good
4:55before you apply it says shake law and i like to use my beauty blender with it
5:01that's a little scary lip and all comes together
5:15I really like to finish that this gives it doesn't feel like a matte finish
5:20but it looks kind of like flawless I don't know how to explain it
5:23it is a little light for me as you can see it a little pill but nothing a
5:28little bronzer Catholics
5:29ok moving on I'm going to take my pixie correction concentrate and brightening
5:34the peach writing peach
5:36it's just like an under-eye corrector I'm gonna place it underneath my eyes
5:42here
5:42I've actually been using an eye cream that has really been working it's a new
5:47eye cream and i love it and i feel like my eyes are as dark as they usually are
5:53and I've got a feeling inside cream so I'm not going to add like a concealer
5:58I'm just gonna focus on highlighting i'm using my dream lumi touch highlighting
6:03concealer
6:04I'm just going to draw it and that's like upside down triangle thing just to
6:07highlight my face
6:10if you hear crickets my windows open
6:13I'm going to use my same beauty blender to blend of him
6:25I didn't do it just a little bit what the hell I'm gonna set my under eyes
6:31with my way but uh 1 14 bucks face focus and I'm going to use my HD under eyes
6:40setting powder
6:41I'm trying to see how this one compares to the laura mercier secret brightening
6:45powder so it's called yet because i really love that one thing i don't like
6:50is this
6:51these little glitters like what you really can't see them all that much
6:56ok so I'm going to do my eyes i'm going to apply them using my mac paint pot as
7:03per usual days in my eyes like ninety percent of the time no matter what
7:06because i find that it really really prolongs the world my eye makeup and
7:11hide all the veins on my lids like all the darkness and all the creepy stuff
7:15because it is like a skin tone color or at least the color close to my skin tone
7:20and I just I really really love it cannot say enough about this i'm going
7:26to take the two faced natural met out
7:29Alan talent I'm going to take right here this color called heaven and on the
7:34brush like this
7:35this is just a Zoe but
7:37325 I'm just going to pack this on my entire lid kind of set that cream base
7:43we put down because if I go in with another eye shadow right now and make
7:46Reese it's just going to get stuck to the base
7:48so this is just going to help put a nice like shadow layer
7:52next I'm going to take this fluffy blending brush by NARS I have no idea
7:56what it's called
7:5842 I'm going to take the color called new tea and i'm just going to apply this
8:03in my crease
8:04this is basically just going to act as my transition shade from the colors i
8:07will be using so they could blend easier
8:11do I look blue feel like this is lights make me look good
8:20I'm going to take this color called honey butter it's a really pretty warm
8:24peanut butter shade and i'm going to apply this to my entire lid this is just
8:27going to be like an all over the lid color for me
8:34also got a diff my fluffy blush brush into that color again and added to my
8:41crease as well
8:44ok nevermind me to channel his palate I'm going to take chocolate cookie and
8:48i'm going to play this on the outer portions of my eye and into my crease as
8:52well
8:52this is a deli am tools brush 77
9:12I'm going to take this small crease brush from making feet
9:17I call it a pencil brush this one looks like and I'm a different honey water and
9:21kind of do the same thing on the lower lash line i'm going to mimic the top
9:25then taking chocolate cookie and putting it on the outer parts of my life
9:41not going to take 6x6 presso and add that to the lower lash line just to take
9:47away some of the warmth so it doesn't look like I have like a red eye
9:55I look crazy just wait
9:57and then I'm going to take it again and do that to the top part
10:05it's going to give it a little bit more deepness and dimension here just a
10:10little bit i'm gonna have some eyeliner to mai tais line and my waterline and
10:16i'm going to use the NYX jumbo pencil liner in brown
10:25obviously i love it these are amazing and my new favorite went to the
10:31drugstore they're so good
10:33I really feel like I don't have to tug at my waterline when i use this because
10:36it just glides on that I don't need to pull my eye
10:40i'm going to highlight like my inner corners and my problem with my face
10:43highlight since everything in here is Matt and I want like more of a similar
10:46thing someone who want to mascara
10:49I'm going to curl my lashes my show more eyelash curler
10:53so now i'm going to prime my life is this is the estee lauder little black
10:59primary eyelash primer
11:02yeah I really love this because it does a great job of keeping my eye lashes
11:07curled throughout the day and they make managed super black and I really i just
11:12love
11:12I just love any mascara that go on top of it makes it that much better
11:16then I'm going with jordanna's best / extreme round cool
11:23this lightning is making me look so pale
11:27I'm gonna cry I just want to have to put on mascara on like on the rest of my
11:30eyes
11:31this lighting is making me look really ghostly like it's driving minutes
11:36remember it's the first time using my life bear with me i'm going to go ahead
11:41and bronze up my face i'm going to use the body shops bronzing powder in light
11:46matte 01
11:48looks like this is like a honey honey comb and i'm using my lem tools nine
11:52seven four
11:53I love this bronzer I feel like it's quickly becoming one of my top fav
11:57bronzers ever because it's that happy medium
12:00it's really light when you look at it in the pan and it's pretty late when you
12:04apply it to your face but you can really build it up
12:07I mean it takes some time to build it up but it builds up really pretty and it's
12:10not packed you at all and it's that perfect undertone it's not to read it's
12:16not too orange it's not too pink or cool toned or money looking at like i'm going
12:21to apply my blush with the same brush
12:24these are the new NYX HD blushes and I really really like them especially this
12:29one this is in the shade soft-spoken and it's such a pretty color for spring
12:35if you're into PT blushes pick this one up its really nice
12:38yeah
12:47but because everything is so mad on my face I want to add like a lot more of
12:51glow
12:52i'm going to use this product this is pretty new to me about a couple months
12:54ago
12:55this is the 24 micro smooth bank sculpting trio in lou manizer and I've
13:01never really give any of the stuff for brand products a glass at all but Olivia
13:07my friend that works at sephora was like I really like these i use them all the
13:10time and they're really good so i picked up this one along with two other ones i
13:14was so impressed by it
13:16it's not that expensive so for words like a much cheaper brand like the
13:21Sephora collection and this gives such a pretty glow to the cheek Spencer subtle
13:25glow like a very wearable everyday natural glow and just like to swirl my
13:30entire brush into this like so were lit up and just dust it takes
13:50my highlight my brow bone with this as well
14:04now i'm just going to finish off with my lips and this is the lip gloss i have
14:08been using non stop i wore it like previous videos when I was wearing a
14:11glossy lip
14:12this is the read my lips lip gloss from the bomb in the color Bam and I usually
14:17just apply this but so you know I'm gonna play Red Sox you can see it's such
14:24a pretty pigmented color i've been wearing it not
14:37ok so that completes the look i really hope you like it it's a very wearable
14:40everyday kind of look in my opinion
14:44sorry about the lighting completely sucks in this video I'm still tweaking
14:48it this was like a trial run
14:50once i get my ring light and I think it will look a lot better but i have to
14:54position them differently
14:56it's tough to work on it so excuse that might be like a you know a couple times
15:02before i get it right but this is the look I've been using or I'm wearing a
15:05lot with this palette i hope you guys get it when it's available it's a halt
15:08all right now but I think it's well worth the money
15:12I hope you guys get it you guys so much for watching and please subscribe if you
15:17haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:11hey guys i decided to do a makeup tutorial today on the eye makeup i'm
0:18wearing right now it is a green smokey eye but they're all of tones like they
0:22have some golden them because I never wear green eyeshadow i just don't think
0:26green eye shadow looks good on me I feel like it clashes with my eye color i
0:29don't know but i didn't want to do a green and gold e kind of I look for
0:34those of you who do like to wear green eyeshadow so this is the look i came up
0:38with i am using two different palettes in this tutorial but you can use colors
0:44that you have at home colours are similar to the ones i'm using and the
0:47colors I'm using our from the natural and night palette from to face and the
0:52Naked palette from urban decay i know a lot of people have this but i'm just
0:57using the greens that are in this palette actually like how it turned out
1:00not necessarily on me but I think this would look so beautiful if you have
1:04brown eyes so definitely try it out i do show you the rest of my face like my
1:09foundation my consider and all that stuff because i haven't been showing
1:11that in the last couple videos my just keep it very fresh and natural on the
1:16rest of my face kind of look I was going for
1:19so yeah if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
1:23ok so like always i'm going to start by priming my eyes and I'm using Mac's
1:26painterly clean hot to do this
1:33now i'm taking my naked palette and I'm using the color naked and i'm going to
1:37use this as my transition color in the crease you can just take any light brown
1:41color
1:51now i'm taking my too faced natural and night palette and I'm going to be using
1:56this color right here called moonstone it is a really pretty
2:01Goldie kind of green it's so nice and i'm going to be putting that on half of
2:10my eyelid on the inner half
2:23I'm taking that all the way up to the crease
2:29but i'm not putting any on the outer be right here now I'm gonna be taking this
2:33color right next to it called night fever which is a deeper green with gold
2:37glitter and this is what's going to be going right on the outer part of my eye
2:44again I'm still a little sick so I still sound a little recipe
2:51forgive me I don't know when I'm going to get rid of this cold
3:02now i'm going back into the Naked palette and I'm getting the color right
3:05here called book and I'm taking that on a fluffy little crease brush and I'm
3:09just going to blend out the colors in my crease
3:20ok so after I've done that I'm going back into my natural night palette and
3:25I'm going to go back into these colors right here and do the exact same thing I
3:29did first only I'm going to be adding 6+2 my brush and this is just going to
3:34intensify the color a lot more
4:10ok so next I'm gonna be taking my 217 i'm going in with this color in the
4:13natural night palette and it is called Coco star like a really pretty brown
4:19even explain it but it's really nice and I'm just going to be taking this into
4:25the outer be right here and then bring it into the crease
4:37I'm bringing that a little bit above my crease as well
4:51then just taking a fluffy brush like this didn't get into that naked color
4:54and just kind of blending that out a little bit more by the way added virgin
5:02as my problem honey I don't know why did that off camera now I'm just going to
5:06add some eyeliner I'm using the Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
5:10midnight master which is just a black and I'm going to tight line with this
5:17and add it to my waterline for my lower lashline and i'm going to be taking the
5:22brown in the natural at night palette here and i'm going to be putting that on
5:31the outer part of my lower lashline the sky just turned black because it knew i
5:39was filming and I know I say sorry in every video so I'm not going to do it
5:45this time but just know the side turn black of course of course i know i keep
5:52going back and forth between these two pallets but what can you do i'm going to
5:57take half baked from the Naked palette and I'm going to add that right here
6:03where this gold is but i'm going to add X plus 2 the brush just to intensify it
6:09may get a lot more vibrant and gold
6:16yeah
6:29I'm going to take spotlight right here and this is gonna be my highlight right
6:35in here
6:37ok so now i'm just going to add some mascara and you can go ahead and add
6:41some winged liner to this look if you want but i like how it looks just like
6:45this my mascara that I'm using is my jordana best / extreme i'm using this on
6:49my top lashes and then for my bottom lashes i'm using be it's so big
6:54volumizing mascara i got this in an empty bag and it actually works pretty
6:58well my bottom lashes and makes them super long so that's what I'm going to
7:02do right now
7:02ok so these are finished eyes if you want to see what is going to go on the
7:08rest of my face then just keep watching
7:10ok so i already filled in my eyebrows i'm really not a fan of how I am green
7:16eye shadow looks at me I know I feel like it just doesn't look good with my
7:21eye color anyway the prime using today is my lauriol magic Lumi Jason never use
7:28this as a primary and now I use it all the time it just makes my skin feel so
7:34nice
7:35the foundation i'm going to be using today is the Maybelline fit me concealer
7:42i have been using this foundation and i gotta say i love it as foundation i
7:51really wish that the fit me foundation had the same creaminess and consistency
7:58as the consider does because honestly this is foundation to me it's not think
8:04it's not cakey and it doesn't make my dry skin look dry
8:12and it has the coverage because it's a concealer is awesome
8:16of course i use a crap ton of product so I waste this pretty easily but
8:28I like it going to be using my Beauty Blender
8:38yeah
8:58for my under eyes I'm using my Maybelline instant age rewind dark
9:01circle eraser crank this up
9:11yeah
9:25yeah
9:29underneath my eyes I'm using my mineralize skinfinish natural and I
9:35always do because it's the bomb diggity
9:38your browser I'm using the Sonia Kashuk warm bronzer
9:47I mean cream bronzer in warm tan just click this and I use that with a real
9:55techniques buffing brush I like this because it gives a very subtle bronze
10:04i'm going to should have left my hair up
10:16huh
10:40yeah
10:48see it's not too pigmented where it looks a little scary just kinda looks
10:51like a natural bronze glow to your face
10:54I really love that for blush I'm using Mac's Melba it is a matte peachy kind of
11:02blush
11:15i'm giving a pretty simple on my lips I'm just using the NYX butter gloss in
11:20creme brulee
11:31ok guys that's it i wanted to do a pretty sultry I look and then keep it
11:35pretty natural and fresh on the rest of my face so I hope you like this tutorial
11:40let me know down below if you did please subscribe if you haven't already and I
11:44will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look I was so surprised
0:16at how many people wanted a tutorial on this look I was wearing this in my
0:20empties video and there were a ton of comments telling me that I needed to sit
0:25down and film this video so i did I didn't think I was going to because the
0:29look is literally so easy it's like easiest look ever but i love this look I
0:34think it's so romantic and pretty kind of like a serial like a soft pink yeah
0:40this is actually a talk through makeup tutorial and if you want to see how to
0:44get this look on my face then just keep watching
0:46so I'm gonna start off with my face since the eyes are so simple i don't
0:49really get a lot of fallout with this look I'm going in with the Knicks born
0:53to glow illuminating primer and i'm just using this on my skin to help it look
0:58nice and glowy this stuff is so similar to the max stroke cream and it's way way
1:04more affordable the foundation going to be using today is the Too Faced Born
1:09This Way Foundation it's the same foundation i was wearing in my empties
1:12video I have a love-hate relationship with this foundation sometimes i like it
1:16sometimes i hate it i like it for the most part by the way i'm using the shade
1:20porcelain i like it for the most part but it can look pretty cakey around my
1:24nose sometimes it just looks heavy on my skin I don't know why but I like it's
1:30just I don't know i'm using a sponge from the brand mascara it's really
1:38really similar to the Beauty Blender and it's more affordable because you're
1:41going to be using today is the tart shape concealer I can't seem to use any
1:45other concealer i mean i do everything I have other concealers i love but these
1:49are just my favorite right now and it's making me want to go on another snapchat
1:52declutter I kind of stopped that series because there was nothing else I really
1:56wanted to declutter but after discovering this amazing concealer I
2:01want to kind of get rid of some of them because
2:04is I don't really use them so i'm just adding a little bit on the inner corners
2:09right here to then blend it out I mixed the shades light/medium and fair and i'm
2:13just going to blend that out you really do not need a lot of this concealer I
2:19know when it comes to youtube videos like you'll see youtubers just like
2:22paint on the concealer like i do i always like paint on my concealer but
2:26for this one specifically I feel like you don't need to do that because a
2:30little goes such a long way so I'm thinking of doing that you really really
2:34really want to give away or get rid of a couple of my concealers because this one
2:40is just so amazing
2:42just a couple just a couple just get rid of a couple i'm going to take a little
2:45bit of the shade fair and apply it to areas i kinda want to highlight a little
2:50bit
2:58I'm going to go in with another cream product and then i'll set my under eye
3:01concealer and all that so I'm going to take my cover effects custom enhancer
3:05drops in the shade sunkist this is the bronze shade the light one i have been
3:10using this as bronzer i love it so much I just take some in the back of my hand
3:14after I shake it a bit and with that same sponge I used for foundation and
3:19concealer i'm just going to apply some to my face
3:31I think this might be the best liquid bronzer i have ever come across in my
3:36life it just blends so well into the skin i'm going to apply some more for
3:41the other side of my face
4:00Celine learned how to open my door now looks like I'm gonna have to change the
4:03doorknobs no privacy with that one
4:06I called my door and asked her to stay outside cuz i'm filming and changes
4:08opens it she's like yeah no I'm coming in gonna add some to my doll line here
4:15ok so now i'm going to go ahead and set my under eye concealer and set areas of
4:22my face when I feel like it needs to be set i'm going to take my rms beauty one
4:26powder just kind of like a translucent HD powder and with this 24 procon tour
4:31number 79 brush i'm just going to set everything
4:44so after powdering my face looks a little bit more mad than I wanted to
4:48so what I did was I went in with this shimmery bronzer it's so dark like this
4:52is way too dark for my skin tone so I have to make sure i use a super super
4:57night hand this is an alpha mineral bronzer in the shade beach bronze i'm
5:01going to take this pressure here i bought it at all so this is the it
5:04cosmetics for alta line exclusively at ulta and this is their airbrush powder
5:09brush I'm gonna take a little bit and I'm going to really tap this off
5:22ok so i'm going to go ahead and do the eye makeup because I really feel like I
5:29need to do my eyes already
5:31okay so I lied apparently there is fallout with this look because of the
5:34glitter I completely forgot about that for some reason so i would suggest doing
5:38your eyes first before your face makeup i'm going to take my surprise rhymes
5:42Anasazi and water one is long and i'm going to take this shaver here called
5:46ball fresco and i'm going to buff this into my crease using a more fiemme 441
5:50brush i'm adding just a little bit of this color to my crease because i will
5:56go back into intensify it a little bit i'm going to take tempera which is this
6:04lightest shade at the front and i'm going to use that to highlight
6:07underneath my rubble and then i'm going to go in with this shining star right
6:13here this is the butter london a butter london something it doesn't say i hate
6:18when companies that was the name of this thing it's like a cream eyeshadow but
6:23it's not like a cream in my opinion it has a similar consistency to hair gel
6:27like really thick sculpting hair gel that is the consistency of this but
6:32they're just like little potted eyeshadows in jelly form this specific
6:37color is in the shade frosted and it's my favorite one they sent me like four
6:40shades
6:41this is so stunning my favorite way to apply this is with my finger so I'm just
6:46gonna dip my finger in there
6:47and I like to build up the coverage so i'll go in a couple times but I'll just
6:51start to apply this to my
6:59yeah
7:02I'm not trying to flick you off i promise i know it's my middle finger but
7:06it's not my intention and apply some more through a good thing about this
7:10eyeshadow is that it builds really well it doesn't get sticky and it lasts a
7:14long time I i I'm going to go back into the Anasazi palette and I'm gonna take
7:18ballbust Oh again i can't say that word normal and with that same crease brush I
7:22used earlier i'm going to add a little bit more of this eyeshadow
7:33ok
7:35I'll just go in with a little bit more of that frosted shade for my inner
7:44corners I'm going to mix these two shades together
7:46premier and primavera first i'm going with Vermeer and then i'm going to top
7:52it off with primera for my lower lashline I'm doing something extremely
7:58simple i'm going to go in with blonde fresco on a little pencil brush this is
8:02a tiny little ecotools shadow smudger brush I'm going to run that on my lower
8:06lashline and then over top of that i'm going to take burnt orange going to curl
8:20my lashes you can go ahead and wear falsies with my empties video I wasn't
8:26wearing any falsies so I'm just going to coat my top and bottom lashes with my
8:30benefit roller lash so that completes the is really simple and we're pretty
8:38much almost done when I filmed my empties video I wasn't wearing any blush
8:42i just went in with my highlight and I used my makeup geek highlighting palette
8:46and I first went in with the pink shade this is called Starling i'm going to try
8:50out this brush this is the morphe are 36 and dip it into that starlight shade
8:58you definitely want to tap off the excess when you're using these
9:02highlights because they're extremely pigmented and then i'm going to go over
9:09top with the shade night light which is the lightest gold shade
9:20I'm going to mix the shade nightlight and starlight and highlight the nose a
9:24little bit and I'm going to take just starlight and highlight my Cupid's will
9:31for lips i was wearing a very very very nude lip almost concealer like but i
9:39think it ties in with like the light pink ethereal look I'm going in with the
9:44buxom true nude lip foundation in the shade but this is the lightest shade
9:48it's so light
9:50the trick with this specific color is you cannot apply too much I find that
9:53when i do that i get that disgusting white thing on the inside of my mouth
9:57you know what i'm talking about so i actually have to tap this on my mouth
10:01and then I just blend in and then i went over it with the colour-pop ultra glossy
10:17lip in the shade fairy floss
10:19this is my favorite shade of all of the new color pop glasses it's just like a
10:23very very light nude but it's not too pigmented it's a sheer formula i love it
10:28i find that glosses this color that are too pigmented give you that weird thing
10:37you think I was talking about
10:41ok guys so that completes the look i really hope you guys enjoyed it i love
10:46looks like this was like a super nude lip and everything kind of like
10:49monochromatic i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for
10:52watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next
10:55video bye
0:00hey guys hey guys so today's video is going to be a tiny get ready i haven't
0:07done one of these videos in a really long time I feel so I decided that is
0:11what i want to do today and it's also going to be kind of like a one brand
0:15video not a one brand tutorial because I don't have a specific look in mind i'm
0:19just going to chat with you guys and some makeup on but it is going to be
0:23using these two for our collection products i asked you guys on Twitter
0:27recently not that recently but I asked you guys on Twitter if you wanted to see
0:31a one brand video using the Sephora collection which if you don't know it's
0:37pretty much so for us brands like so for ourselves a bunch of different brands
0:40but they also have their own personal brand called sephora collection and it's
0:45a lot more affordable than their other brands sold there
0:48it's not necessarily drugstore prices but not very high end either for some of
0:52these are actually going to be first impressions
0:55some of these already tried by the way I know I know I know I know
0:58no i did not post a video monday or wednesday today is Friday
1:03I never go this long without posting a video my last video was a week ago
1:07that is so unlike me but I couldn't post the video on monday because this weekend
1:11was completely crazy i had no time and then monday came and the people who are
1:16installing our closets and the people who are it's only our curtains and
1:20windows came at the same time so I had people making so much noise here monday
1:25i couldn't film they had to come back to finish tuesday i couldn't film and then
1:29yesterday we had to come back to finish
1:31I could have felt so today I decided okay finally I can sit down the phone
1:35and yesterday i woke up with a cold and I was like oh no I'm not going to let a
1:42stuffy nose and a fever
1:44stop me from filming know so please excuse the fact that i have a cold
1:49story of my life find to drink more vitamin C
1:52ok so i'm going to go ahead and get started I've got my little coffee
1:55so now that it's officially spring i bought a new little headband to use in
2:01my tutorials
2:02oh isn't it beautiful
2:06I love him my little hearts might make a comeback next fall in would i bought
2:11these at forever 21
2:12ok so I'm going to start off with a primer I'm gonna actually start off with
2:16my face makeup
2:17i'm going to be using these two for our Beauty amplifier after Google primer and
2:21lou manizer from the Sephora collection
2:24all of these products are from the support brand so i'm not going to say
2:28that every time because i know that's our knowing this product is pretty new
2:31I've never tried it before so this is like a first impression
2:35it comes out a really beautiful like gold liquid
2:39this is kind of reminding me of the door glow maximizer that's like super super
2:48expensive
2:50this has like a similar feel to it
2:53I don't know it could be something I like
2:56ok so now that is on my face i'm actually going to go ahead and do my
2:59eyebrows I always do my eyebrows off camera but i had bought a stew for a
3:04brow product
3:05this is there retractable brow pencil and it's waterproof and I got rich
3:09chestnut not sure if this matches me the only thing I don't like right off the
3:13bat when I look at it is the little comb
3:15it's not a spoolie it's like a comb and I'm not into these like they hurt like
3:23how scratching my forehand
3:25so I'm just going to go ahead and do my eyebrows
3:30it's a little reddish for my brows like it's a very warm brown actually really
3:48like it I like it it's really easy to use I don't like the color it's a little
3:51bit red for my hair blue for this video
3:55it's okay
3:58like I don't understand why they don't just put a spoolie like what is this
4:04little fork
4:05now i'm going to go ahead with this so for a brow thickener which I don't need
4:10this shit
4:11I don't need any more thickness but it's like a brow powder it's so strange i've
4:15never tried this before either
4:17this is in the shade medium brown some vodka
4:26maybe this will told him down the redness
4:33well that will blow you know what this is cool for sometimes when you use a
4:40pencil you kind of missed certain spots
4:44this is really cool to just go over those spots you missed or if you have
4:47really really full brows and you only need a little bit of like something
4:52this is pretty cool my browser not twins today just regular old sisters
4:57ok so for foundation i bought 2 to 4 brand foundations
5:01I have the perfection mr. airbrush foundation because a lot of you guys
5:05said it was a dupe for my dior air flash and then i bought the 10-hour where
5:11perfection foundation
5:13I was going to try this one out today but this is way too dark for me this is
5:18like my tanning shaidan is not down so i'm going to use this 1i got the shade
5:24light
5:25it says its oil free and has a second skin technology has medium coverage
5:29paraben free fragrance free formulated without mineral oil non-comedogenic
5:33sounds great great great
5:36so it looks pretty thick it's not very liquidy
5:40we shall see i prefer kind of like more liquidity
5:46the pump on this foundation is really amazing like you could really control
5:51how much you take out
5:56ok so that is a pump and a half of foundation i'm not exactly sure the
6:00finish of it because i use a very luminizing primer underneath so right
6:05now it's looking really like Dewey and radiant it has some tackiness to it for
6:10sure
6:10I'm going to go in with some concealer this is their bright future gel serum
6:15concealer and i've heard mixed reviews about this concealer this is another
6:18product i've never used before a lot of these products
6:20i just bought I heard that some people like it but the application sucks
6:24because it's the weirdest thing but product doesn't get on the entire wand
6:29only at the very tip so you do have to like it's meant to be dotted but you
6:35can't really like rub because no product comes off so you have to like constantly
6:40dip your wand back into the concealer which is really weird and kind of time
6:47consuming so that's kind of lonely around enough my slumber
6:59because i have a cold i do have like some discoloration on my eyelids so I'm
7:07dragging that on my lids
7:09I don't know I know how I feel about that I don't know how i feel about this
7:12concealer
7:13it's a little bit cakey on my skin but it didn't blend out nicely
7:17mmm ok so i'm going to go ahead and set my under eye concealer I don't have a
7:22translucent powder from sephora this is their micro smooth baked face compact
7:28and medium which looks hella dark
7:31I'm just going to set my face using the NARS translucent crystal powder
7:37i'm going to apply just a really light layer of this powder to my face using it
7:45was a mild simple brush because I do feel like this foundation needs to be
7:50set
7:50it's a little bit tacky so recently i purchased the bronzing powder in low
7:57squabbles
7:58this is what it looks like i really really love this but I saw that they
8:01came out with a sculptor like a contour product in the shade lowest cobbles
8:07this is still being sold on this afore website purchase this one just in case
8:11anybody was wondering if there's a difference like if it's exactly the same
8:16why are they selling both of them and they're pretty much the same color but
8:20this one is much more pigmented let me show you okay so i'm going to swatch
8:30this one is so much more pigmented this one is a lot softer so I don't know what
8:36the dealio with that is but today I'm going to contour using this one because
8:40it is a little bit less pigmented so I don't want to go in with such a heavy
8:44hand
8:45I kind of might prefer this one over the other would because it lets you
8:53it lets you build up the color but if you aren't as fair as me then definitely
8:58go for the like og because it's you'll get a better color payoff
9:02so is anybody caught up with how to get away with murder i'm not going to ruin
9:08it i'm not going to say any spoilers but I don't even know how to feel about that
9:14finale
9:15I'm not going to spoil it but i do like Frank and I know that I shouldn't
9:19because Frank is not a good person at all but i do like Frank
9:24I don't know why what is wrong with me and also sign no I am 100-percent
9:29completely over scandal
9:31I was obsessed with scandal guys like it was my issue you know I was so team
9:37jacob was all about that show but now it's just it's gotten to the point where
9:41it's like okay put a lid on this show and I'm sorry for those of you really
9:45really still love it
9:46I just can't deal with Olivia Pope anymore she is a stone-cold biatch
9:50I don't know and I just don't like where the show is going I'm like so incredibly
9:53bored it's a snoozefest
9:55I haven't seen like the last three episodes how to get away with murder
9:58scandal
10:01No ok so I really really really like this product
10:05it gave me a very soft natural contour as opposed to this would be a little bit
10:09stronger but I like them both with a tan
10:13I might want to use something more pigmented I don't know this is so weird
10:16but I'm going to go in with blush next and i'm going to be using one
10:21these blushes and I have the shade can't stop smiling which is a really pretty
10:27peach and then
10:28so shy which is like a nice bubble gum pink I'm actually gonna go with the
10:31peach one cuz I'm might be doing like a regular bronzy I the usual you know it's
10:38not a tutorial
10:40now i'm going to highlight and to be completely honest i'm not a big fan of
10:48any of the highlighting products so for a collection has I tried one of their
10:53illuminators that look like this
10:55it comes in this packaging and I did not like i have these sephora radiant
11:00luminizing drops
11:01this is in morning light i'm going to try to death some of this on my
11:05cheekbones
11:05even though i already applied powder but what about okay so i just added a little
11:16bit of something I didn't want to disrupt my foundation underneath and my
11:19blush which I kind of did
11:21so I'm going to take the illuminator in this little trio
11:25it's a very very subtle highlight like you don't get much from this at all
11:31there's not much color payoff at all at all actually want a little bit more
11:39glowing assign oh that's crazy but I'm going to take this
11:42sephora baked blush duo and mango being i love these like luminous
11:48so for blushes they're amazing add some right here
11:52ok so I'm going to do my eyes keep in mind when you use products like this you
11:59can use these wet
12:00so if you want even more intense highlight you can what this
12:04now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm going to do something very very simple
12:07i'm going to use their baked eyeshadow trio in indian summer i'm actually going
12:11to use the bronzer shade in this to use as my crease shade and I'm gonna buff
12:19this into the crease
12:20I use the bronzer as eyeshadow all the time
12:24I'm going to take my brush and spray mac fix+ Honor this is a mac 239 and then
12:33I'm going to go into this shade right here it's a really pretty bronzy taupe
12:37color and i'm going to use that all over my lid wedding the eyeshadow is
12:41definitely going to intensify it and these baked products are awesome too wet
12:44because you don't mess up the eye shadow
12:53then I'm going to go into this really dark chocolatey shade this is a sophie
13:00320 brush kind of like a mac 217 and I'm going to pack that on my outer corners
13:05not going to wet my brush
13:10I only want just a little bit of depth for my waterline i'm going to take the
13:20waterproof retractable eyeliner in the shade and deep plum mat deep plum and
13:26I've never tried this before and it's not my favorite the colour-pop liners
13:34are like five dollars and they are so much more pigmented in this my gosh that
13:39is totally a bus for me like struggle to put that on
13:43I'm going to blend that out using the chocolate color
13:47I'm going with mascara next and I didn't buy a mascara because i'm a fool
13:56so I'm going to go in with mike eagle extra sculpt
14:01ok so we are pretty much done here I'm just going to go in with my lip combo
14:07I'm going with the sephora ruse Joe lip liner in the shade
14:11nothing but nude as I haven't used this color before I just bought it but i have
14:16used this formula and it's amazing i really love these lip liners
14:20this is such a pretty lip liner I love it and the formula i love it a lot of it
14:29I'm gonna go over it with this guy right here I don't even know what this is
14:32called just saw it on the support website and i was like wow that looks
14:35really pretty color
14:36I don't even know what the name of it is I don't know if it's like their lip balm
14:39and lip stick thing but it comes in this packaging and this is in the shade
14:42number one
14:43yeah I have no idea like who
14:48I like that it's still pretty and it feels so comfortable on the lips had a
14:57really good color payoff
14:59I can't smell it because my nose is stuffy but i really like that
15:03ok guys so that completes this look I know that this video wasn't very chatty
15:07but honestly I'm just under the weather and I don't feel the best but I had to
15:12get a video up so i'm sorry if i wasn't very entertaining in this video I'm
15:15sorry
15:16some of these definitely were hits and some of these definitely misses the
15:20primer amazing i gave my skin really glowy look I really really like that so
15:25far this foundation looks good it does look like second skin it's not too bad
15:28actually think I don't like this because all the places where i apply the
15:33concealer made my skin look a little bit cakey great broad product if it was less
15:37warm and it came with a spoolie but i really like it
15:40and this product is pretty cool too this is a great little contour amazing
15:44not a fan of the highlight in this really really loved the blush
15:48I love their blushes they're baked ones and their color for one's awesome
15:52blushes and while this is really pretty
15:55it only works wet because this brown chain i was having a hard time like
15:59applying it to my lid and i'm also not a fan at all this eyeliner but i really
16:05really really really love their lip liner formula and this like lip balm
16:09nude
16:10number one thing is beautiful love it so that completes this video I hope you
16:15guys enjoy thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't
16:18already and I will see you in my next video
0:26hey guys so today's video is going to be a tutorial using the electric palette
0:32from urban decay
0:33please excuse that . on my eyelid
0:37I did it with my eyeliner by mistake at the end of this video and it upset me
0:41I know but let's pretend this lone pair shall we so this look is really fun and
0:46dramatic and I know it's not for everybody but i just think it's really
0:49cool and I do basic everyday tutorials on my channel all the time so I decided
0:53to switch it up
0:54let's go so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to take max painterly Paint
0:58Pot and i'm going to apply this to my entire lid
1:00this is going to act as a base cover up any redness and find my eyes as well
1:04going into the Urban Decay palette i'm going to take the color called chaos
1:09it is a really bright royal blue and I'm gonna pack this on my entire lid and
1:13then forgot that I had an added tape to the corner of my eye so i quickly add
1:17that this is just gonna make a cat eye effect and make everything look sharp
1:21and clean so I'm just gonna pack this on my entire lid and bring it up to
1:25decrease
1:33next I'm going to take this milani eyeshadow called below cafe i believe
1:36and I'm just gonna bust this into my crease as a transition shade it's just
1:40going to help that blue blend out a little bit more
1:55next I'm going to take this eyeshadow and the pally called urban it is a
1:59beautiful purple and i'm going to start building this color in my crease with a
2:03mac 217
2:05this part is super tedious and it takes a lot of work but just go back and forth
2:09in the eye shadow and build up the color
2:11little by little because it is such an intense color you are going to want to
2:15build this up and work very very slowly and just pack it on a little by little I
2:20know it can be time consuming but it's better to do it this way they look like
2:24you have way too much in the crease so I'm just going back and forth dipping my
2:29brush in the eye shadow and slightly blending it into my crease then i'm
2:33going to go back into chaos and pack this onto my lid because a lot of it and
2:39get blended away from all the blending we did these two colors look really cool
2:43layered on top of each other because it looks like three different eye shadows
2:46on my lid when really there's just two of them
2:49it's really cool so now back with my - 17 I'm going back into the urban shade
2:54and building it again like I said little by little i'm also dragging it that
2:59brush into my crease really really lightly so that it can blend seamlessly
3:03so I'm packing most of the color right in the socket of my crease and then with
3:07the really light hand I'm trying to feather it out
3:10higher in my crease if that makes any sense
3:17and then again some more packing on of that chaos color
3:25I know time-consuming just going to go back and forth between these two
3:28eyeshadows now I'm just going to clean up some of the fallout with any makeup
3:32remover wipe and then I'm going to take the Urban Decay Naked basics palette i'm
3:37going to go into that shade foxy and I'm going to blend this underneath my brow
3:40bone
3:41this is just gonna help that purple color blend out a little bit better then
3:45I don't know why I didn't record myself doing that but I dip this brush into the
3:50shimmery shade in The Naked basics palette and apply that to my energy or
3:54dust and underneath my brow bone to highlight now I'm just gonna add some
3:58winged eyeliner I'm going to take my la girl very black gel eyeliner and just
4:03add a wing and then of course I got so close
4:07I got out of focus as per usual I'm going to move on to the rest of my face
4:12and I'm going to take my Too Faced hangover primer and this is just going
4:14to prime my face and moisturize my face really well
4:22next I'm gonna mix two foundations and they're both the Rimmel stay matte
4:26foundation and i'm just going to buff this into my skin using a real
4:30techniques expert face brush I'm going to quickly skim through the face like I
4:38usually do because you know it's something you've seen very many times
4:42before and I think people are more interested in the eye
4:45look at this video then what's on the rest of my face
4:48I'm gonna take my Maybelline fit me consider I believe this is in the shade
4:5210 light or 15 bear i'm not exactly sure I think it's 10 and I'm just gonna cover
4:58my dark circles with this and highlight my face a little bit
5:16i'm going to set everything using Mac's emphasize powder and i'm using this on
5:23an elf flawless concealer brush
5:25I believe that's the name
5:29now i'm going to take this milani jumbo pencil in the shade royal purple and i'm
5:36going to use this as my eyeliner
5:38this is just going to make the look look extra probably on the bottom / believe
5:42yeah i know i'm going to take carbon again on a pencil brush and just much
5:46this underneath my lash line
5:53yeah
5:59then I'm going to dip that pencil brush into milania's Bella cafe and i'm going
6:03to further smoke it out so it looks nice and smoky on the bottom
6:06I'm just going to drag it towards the winged eyeliner i don't know if you can
6:10tell I'm just dragging it up towards the wing and I should have zoomed in this
6:14part but I completely forgot
6:15of course then I'm just going to quickly curl my lashes at the mascara and then
6:21i'm going to apply some falsies i'm going to use the R del wispies and then
6:26i'm going to finish off my face
6:27I'm going to take been nice powder Rouge in the shade contour number one and
6:32unequal tools brush I'm going to contour my face
6:57I'm going to take this tart blush in the shade exposed
7:00I don't want something super pigmented or noticeable on my cheeks and my eyes
7:04are already so loud
7:05so I'm going for a natural blush lipstick
7:10I'm going to use my Too Faced lipstick in the shade nude beach and yeah it's
7:16really pretty new color love this lipstick taking my physicians formula
7:21stripper stripper no shimmer strip while shimmer strips and natural nude i'm
7:27going to use this to highlight
7:28ok guys so that completes this look I really hope you enjoyed it thank you
7:33guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
7:36will see you in my next video bye
0:15hey guys today's videos in makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right
0:23here this is using the Anastasia i keep saying Anastasia and I'm trying to teach
0:30myself to say anastacio artists palette this just recently came out i purchased
0:36my nap ulta.com I don't know if they're still in stock or not but i'm pretty
0:40sure i purchased it like the Dare than the day after it came out I wanted to
0:44buy it because i have so many neutral palette and this one just looked
0:50different to me because they do have other neutral colors thrown in the mix
0:54this is actually a really really easy like ridiculous like ridiculously easy
0:59makeup tutorial which is ok right because it's like one Shadow kind of and
1:06I feel like there's so many tutorials out there that it's like real that are
1:10really hard to recreate and I feel like this is pretty easy to recreate I know
1:13it's a little bit out there because it has like that super bowl yellow under I
1:18and in person it's a lot more intense like I didn't think this yellow color
1:22would be as intense as it is which I'm glad it is because it's really pigmented
1:26they're really like it so far
1:28so yeah I like this palette give it a big thumbs up and if you want to see how
1:32to give these Luke I've been my whole face but if you want to get this look
1:37then just keep watching
1:38I'm going to prime my eyelids with Mac's painterly Paint Pot it is my all-time
1:43favorite you guys know I'm gonna take the artist Shalit what the artist
1:49palette and the shadow called buttery it's a creamy matte vanilla shade and
1:56i'm going to set that paint pot with that shadow
1:58I'm gonna take dusty rose it's a beautiful Dessi rose color a little bit
2:03mabi it's seriously stunning one of my favorites in this palette and it blends
2:08like a dream and I'm going to apply that in windshield wiper motions into my
2:12crease using a big fluffy blending brush
2:16this matte purple color is called aubergine and its really really
2:20pigmented but you do have to kind of like work in little sections so i'm
2:23using this on a flat shader brush and I'm just packing that onto my eyelid and
2:29that's going on my entire lid but I'm not gonna take it past the crease with a
2:37smaller fluffy brush really similar to the mac 217 this one's just from Sophie
2:42I'm going to go back into that dusty rose shade and then I'm going to blend
2:46out the harsh lines that the aubergine shade kind of made if that makes sense
2:52now I'm going back into that flat shader brush and I'm doing the whole thing all
3:01over again because a lot of the color does get blood away once you start
3:05blending in the crease i'm just doing it all over again and then taking a little
3:09bit more of the dusty rose and just blowing out the look i wanted to be
3:13really smoky in the crease and kind of played nicely i'm going to take a small
3:20little brush and add the buttery shade underneath my brow bone to kind of lift
3:25the brow a little bit so I'm going to start on my face I was like crying
3:29because I was watching The Voice which constantly makes me cry but anyway i'm
3:34taking the Makeup Forever hydrating primer and i'm applying that to my
3:39entire face and then I'm gonna mix both of the Maybelline matte and poreless and
3:46the original fit the original foot me is a lot more dewy and the matte and
3:50poreless is obviously not and poreless they're both from the fit me line but I
3:54find that combining both of them together i get such a natural beautiful
3:58finish and i'm using an elf stippling brush to apply that or concealer i'm
4:03using my Mac Pro Longwear and I'm taking this on like a pointy little brush from
4:08sedona lease
4:09and then this I'm what I'm going to drag it across my I to kind of sharpen the
4:14makeup the eye makeup as you just saw if that makes sense so yeah covering my
4:19dark circles and then cleaning everything up with this concealer as
4:22well and i'm also highlighting a little bit more with my maybelline dream lumi
4:28magically dream lumi touch highlighting concealer in ivory so i am adding some
4:36more underneath my eyes and then highlighting other parts of my face with
4:39this concealer as well and then I'm just going to blend that all and using that
4:44same brush I used to blend out or to apply my mac concealer I feel like it
4:49cannot speak today I don't know what's wrong with me
4:56so I'm going to take my favorite product ever this is the two-faced cocoa contour
5:03kit and I'm gonna take this
5:05morphy blush brush and I'm going to dip it into the shade like cocoa and this is
5:10gonna set my concealer and bring a lot of light underneath fine
5:13it's a beautiful like Matt the kind of the glowy highlighting powder i love it
5:20so I'm gonna finish off my eyes before I go on to the rest of my face I'm gonna
5:24take this color called brush is a very vibrant Matt bright yellow and on a
5:30sigma pencil brush I'm going to apply that underneath my lower lashline i'm
5:34going to drag it down pretty far as you can see on my other eye
5:39I yeah i'm also gonna bring that into my teacher just as well and i'm going to be
5:43very very messy with this i'm going to apply that sucker all over my lower
5:48lashes and i'm going to extend it to wear the purple is as well I'm gonna
5:53take this buttery shade again buttery yeah buttery shade again and on that
5:57same pencil brush I'm just gonna go over my inner tear duct because i don't want
6:00to start yellow on the inner corners just like a light yellow this is the NYC
6:07liquid eyeliner my favorite it's nice black and Matt and I love it and I'm
6:12just going to do a typical wing and of course i can never catch that on camera
6:16so yeah just do the wing like I normally do i added some false lashes and i'm
6:20using the L'Oreal telescopic mascara on my lower lashes not too much because i
6:25don't want to take away from the yellow under I but that pretty much completes
6:29the eye makeup now I'm going to contour using the medium cocoa powder in this
6:35contouring kit this one is like a very cool tone brown so it's perfect for
6:40contouring and i'm using that on my brush there my friend got her Ipsy bag
6:43and gave it to me so yeah i'm using that to contour i love this for contouring
6:49it's the perfect undertone seriously beautiful
6:52and it smells like Coco so you know I like eat so I just contouring my face
7:04like I normally would sides of my nose and my jawline and all that stuff and
7:11now I just want to warm up my cheeks a little bit so I'm taking a fluffier
7:14brush this is from zoeva and I'm dipping it into the medium cocoa shade in the
7:19kit it's a lot warmer as you can see there was something on that brush don't
7:24know what that was but it's warmer so it gives a nice warm to the skin it's nice
7:31i love it like i love it so much the only thing i don't like about the
7:34contouring kit is that shimmery highlight I don't like it at all like
7:38glittery weird so to highlight my cheekbones i'm using this elf sunkist
7:43bronzer in the shade sunkist you can't tell on camera but it gives the most
7:47beautiful golden glow and it's two dollars i love it
7:50now I'm going to line my lips using the two-faced perfect lips lip liner in the
7:55shade perfect nude i love this lip liner it's like my favorite I've talked about
8:00it plenty of times we have just gonna overdraw my lips just a tiny bit not too
8:06crazy but yeah I'm gonna do that and then just fill them in and then i'm
8:10going to go over it with a lipstick this is revlon's super lustrous lipstick in
8:15the shade of pink

3:05I'm going to go in with some concealer this is the Catrice waterproof liquid
3:09camouflage concealer i love this concealer its full coverage and I really
3:13really like how it blends out it blends effortlessly
3:17so I'm just blending that in with the same sponge I applied with my foundation
3:21now i'm gonna just add a little bit of something underneath the eyes to
3:25highlight a bit
3:26this is dandelion shy beam it's like a map pinky highlight so it's perfect to
3:30brighten up the under eyes
3:36i'm going to set that concealer down using my RC ma no color powder
3:40i'm also going to set my eyelids because i did use that concealer kind of like a
3:45primer for the eye shadow
3:47so I'm just sitting down everywhere I put some concealer
3:50now i'm going into the benefit cheekathon palette i'm going to take
3:53this little benefit bamboo brush and I'm going to dip it into hula and i'm just
3:57going to bronze up the skin with this brush I'm going to go in and contour in
4:00a second but i'm just using this brush to lightly apply some hula all over Z
4:05face
4:05now i'm going to take the little contour brush in the kit and i'm going to start
4:10to contour with this brush and then I'm going to flip it on its side to kind of
4:13blend everything out
4:20for blush I'm going to mix two shades together i'm gonna take the coralista
4:24blush and rocket or I really like the combo of these two blushes and i'm going
4:29to apply these to my sheiks
4:36now i'm going to highlight my face using the makeup revolution shimmer brick in
4:41the shade radiant it's a very intense highlight as you can see very intense
4:46take your time to blend this out but it is very very beautiful and very
4:50affordable i love it
4:51so to set all those powders down i just took my pixie milky hydrating mist and
4:57spread that all over my face and now i'm going to move on to my eyes
5:01first I'm going to take makeup geeks Peach Smoothie eyeshadow i'm going to
5:04use this as a transition shade i love the warm
5:08peachy color in this eyeshadow amazing i love it
5:11now i'm going to go in with Poppy also by make a peek
5:14i'm using all makeup geek eyeshadows in today's tutorial and i'm going to start
5:18slowly dragging this color into the crease I want it concentrated on the
5:23outer corners of my eyes and in my crease as well so i'm just taking that a
5:28nice fluffy blending brush and blending that it
5:31next I took makeup geeks mocha and i'm applying this only on the outer corners
5:35just to add a little bit of depth I wanted a color that was a little bit
5:38deeper and more natural so I took a dark brown just the violence balance
5:43everything out
5:45then I took I'm peach list this is a duochrome eyeshadow and i'm applying
5:49this to the inner corners and a little bit like on the top and bottom like
5:54inner half there just to brighten and highlight those sections and for
5:58underneath my brow bone I didn't want something too shimmery so I took white
6:02lies which is a nice matte vibrant white
6:05so for the lower lash line I'm just taking peach smoothie on a pencil brush
6:09and pretty much putting this everywhere
6:12buffing that right in my lower lash line and then I'm taking this amazing color
6:16pop eyeliner in the shade puppy
6:18sony on so intensely orange it's amazing i'm putting that on my waterline and
6:24then to blend things out a little bit i'm taking papi and blending it really
6:29really close to the eyeliner
6:30just so that everything you know there's no harsh lines or anything
6:33then I took Peach Smoothie one more time and blended the crap out of poppy and
6:38yeah
6:39then I curl my lashes this was before I burned off my eyelashes on that I yes

6:47and i'm getting a little sad but you know what
6:49it's just eyelashes let's move on i'm applying benefits roller lash and then
6:54to finish off this look I'm just applying my lip color this is over a
6:57long lasting liquid lipstick in the shade
6:59sao paulo but I didn't want a matte finish i wanted something a little bit
7:03glossy so on top of that i took the Knicks sugar pie lip gloss and just put

0:20hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look it's a very strong
0:26makeup look at least for me and actually had a mishap
0:30well this whole video was a hot mess but I'm still gonna post it anyway
0:33the foundation color didn't match because it's my self tan shade and I'm
0:37not tan right now and then
0:39while i was using my cocoa contour kit I was contouring with the cool tone color
0:43here and then I accidentally dip my brush into dark cocoa without looking
0:49and then stamped on my forehead here but i love the eye makeup so much this is
0:53the second time that I've done it
0:55um not on camera I decided to film it because I wore this I looked the other
0:58day and I loved it so I decided to film it for you
1:00since all my looks on my channel are very natural daytime appropriate i
1:04wanted to switch it up so this is the way it came up with and if you want to
1:07see it again as Luke then just keep watching
1:10so I'm going to prime my eyes using the Mac prep and prime 24-hour extent that I
1:14base this is by far my favorite color list primer
1:18this is an anastacio eyeshadow in the shade stone and i'm going to use this as
1:22my transition shade just buffing this into my crease so everything blends
1:26nicely on top
1:28this is a mac pro longwear pain pops in the shade genuine treasure
1:32I'm not exactly sure if this will limit in tissue not i bought mine on the back
1:36website
1:37not that long ago either so I just pop that on my entire lid and now i'm taking
1:42the morphe eye shadow in the shape deep skin and
1:46blending that into my crease some more just to warm it up then I'm taking make
1:50it Peaks white lies eyeshadow and highlighting with that
1:54now for my favorite part i'm going to add fix+ to my brush and I'm going into
1:58the Urban Decay eyeshadow in the shade
2:01dymond dog it's a super super sparkly eyeshadow it's one of their moondust
2:06shadows
2:08it's so worth it i love it so I applied that to my entire lid and I'm taking
2:12makeup geeks bit in shadow and on a tiny little blending brush
2:16I'm just precisely adding this into the crease and that's all I pretty much it
2:21and then I took deep skin again from morphe and I'm just blending everything
2:26out so things are nice and seamless
2:28I'm going to take um scheme' by makeup geek and white lies and layer them on
2:34top of each other in my inner corner and now i'm going to add just like a pop of
2:39color something a little bit different i decided to add some green eyeliner and
2:44this is from ga
2:45it's called their liquid shimmer eyeliner and this is in the shade links
2:50so i'm just applying a tiny little wing super easy nothing too fancy just a
2:55little pop of something so now i'm going to prime my face using be two-faced and
3:00hangover RX primer and then i went in with the covergirl stay luminous
3:04foundation the luminous foundation and then I realize oh this is not my shade
3:11this is my summer she
3:13a season but I just went with it anyway
3:18you know mistakes happen sometimes
3:22ok so i'm just going to blend that in and try my best now i'm going to apply
3:26some concealer just to see if i can help with the color situation so i'm using
3:32more than I normally do but this is the Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
3:3515 fair and i'm just highlighting applying this under my eyes all over my
3:41face and I'm going to blend that in with a real techniques blush brush so usually
3:47blend my concealer in about a million times so i decided to skip over that now
3:50I'm going to take my two phase cocoa contour kit
3:53this is a real techniques setting brush and I'm going to set my under eye
3:56concealer using the light
3:58Coco shade which is like the whitish shade in the palette and then i'm
4:02setting everywhere else I apply the concealer taking this morphy pencil
4:07brush I'm going to take that eyeshadow called deep skin by more feet and I'm
4:10gonna blend that underneath my eyes
4:12this is an eyeshadow by NARS it's one of their duel and tend to the eyeshadows
4:16and I filmed this before the makeup geek dual chrome eye shadows came out so I
4:21would have just used in making pink one because it's much cheaper but i have
4:24been ours once i use it
4:26now i'm going to go in with the clinique chubby lash mascara
4:30this is like they're burgundy one and I think it gives a cool little twist to
4:34the look
4:35so that completes the eyes and now i'm going to go ahead and finish the face
4:39this is a foundation palette from mascara cosmetics I follow her on
4:43Instagram and I followed her blog for a really long time so this is a really
4:47really cool concept
4:49I'm going to take the brush that came with it and i'm going to use that
4:53contour shade at the cream it's a cream palette by the way i'm going to use the
4:56contour shade to just outline my face with that pointy part and then I'm going
5:01to flip the brush over and just blend out that cream contour this is the
5:05perfect shade
5:07because it has like that nice actually undertone so it's perfect for contouring
5:15now i'm going to go back into the tube a school contract and I don't know why I'm
5:18holding it out to the side like that
5:21I think that's super weird i'm holding out of them so I'm just going to start
5:25contouring my cheekbones with the azure shade in this kit
5:29I want something a little more dramatic and this is where accidentally put the
5:33wrong bronze on my forehead and I'm like freaking out like a you put the warm
5:37bronzer you're supposed to put the ashy one and then things went south a little
5:41bit but I hope and I fixed it a little bit
5:44so now i'm going to take the knee of urban decay blush is in the shade
5:49rapture I believe I have the correct name down below but i'm pretty sure it's
5:52rapture and this is a super dark blush but likely applied it's really pretty so
5:57that's what I did and then tie like my face
6:00I went in with the Natasha no glow palette in the shade 01 light and I
6:05highlight my cheekbones and my nose in any other place I would normally
6:08highlight so to finish off the look I'm going to apply this color pop ultra
6:14matte lip in the shade trap and then
6:16that completes makeup look I really hope you guys enjoy
6:20thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
6:23will see you in my next video bye
0:09hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look i'm

0:43today i wanted to use the mecca and jaclyn hill champagne glow collection i
0:48used the face palette
0:50it's amazing amazing i'm not going to do like a whole review because i know
0:54there's like a hundred videos reviewing this already i just wanted to show you
0:57this look I used the eyeshadow palette the face palette and the liquid
1:02illuminator and all that I totally think I overdid it with the glow i'm like
1:06super glowy but that's the point
1:08it's a globally collection so if you want to see how to get this really dewy
1:12summary bronze a look and just keep watching
1:15ok so i'm starting off by priming my face using the backup primer this is the
1:20backlight priming filter and then i went in with the back wha
1:24equi becca aqua luminous foundation i have to speed this part up because you
1:28guys for some reason I just take forever to blend this into my skin it's just one
1:33of those foundations I really have to work in for it to look as natural as
1:36possible but when I do it's beautiful
1:39we can see where i'm using is the Catrice camouflage concealer
1:43at first this was going to be a one brand tutorial like I was going to do
1:47only backup products but then i realized i was using a couple of other things
1:51that were in becca so it just didn't end up happening but I use a lot of becca in
1:57this video so I'm just popping that in with my sedona lace 217 brush
2:02this time I can see I'm going to use my trusty it cosmetics
2:11bye bye pores pressed powder and i'm just setting my under eye concealer
2:14setting my eyes because i also used that concealer kind of as a primer for the
2:19future
2:20I'm just setting anywhere i put the concealer basically that's what I'm
2:23setting
2:24I'm gonna take the becca shimmering skin Perfector liquid in champagne pop I love
2:29it is beautiful
2:31i'm using a sponge to apply this to the tops of my cheekbones and on my nose and
2:35all the places i want to highlight this is a sponge from the brand mascara but
2:39you can use any spongy Beauty Blender the Real Techniques sponge
2:43they work really well with liquid highlights this is amazing i highly
2:47highly recommend you get the liquid version of champagne pop it is stunning
2:52like I definitely liked it a lot more than I thought I would I mean I I know
2:55you don't like it but I love it
2:57so I'm just friends at my skin with my physicians formula butter bronzer but
3:01then I wanted something a little bit warmer so I took out my kiko desert
3:05dunes bronzer this is like one of their new summer bronzers i bought it on the
3:09Kiko website and i got mine in the shade warm and i just use this to warm up my
3:14skin a little bit and now i'm using of the mecca and jaclyn hill champagne
3:19collection face palette is beautiful this mirror is insane it's it's amazing
3:23it's amazing the blush i'm going to use amaretto it's kind of like am at a warm
3:28peachy shade beautiful i love this blush it was the first time I used it and I
3:33love
3:34it was beautiful to highlight my cheekbones some more i took a little bit
3:37of prosecco pop and then i apply champagne pop on top
3:41recycled pop is just a little bit to gold for me but the combination of the
3:44two is really pretty
3:46so lamb at the highlight ok so now i'm going to take the eyeshadow palette i'm
3:51going to take the shade cordial and i'm going to use this in my crease
3:55I usually do 1i off camera but honestly I was totally winging this look like I
3:59didn't even know what I was gonna end up doing huh
4:02so I just you know winged it I'm going to take the marc jacobs twinkle pop in
4:08the shade
4:09three shakes and i'm applying this to my entire lid kind of like a base for the
4:13eyeshadow and blending that out with my finger and then I'm going to take the
4:18eyeshadow named champagne toast and i'm applying that right on top of the base i
4:23put down
4:24I've heard kind of like mixed reviews of this palette I think becca like did
4:28something with the formula i'm not sure what the buzz is but i actually really
4:32like my palette i think the quality is pretty good i'm taking the shade cognac
4:38and i'm applying that on the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging
4:40them into my crease and then taking a different brush and puffing out the
4:45edges so that there are no harsh lines
4:48I do that a couple times go back into cognac and then just buff out the edges
4:58then I took the shade
5:02bordeaux and added very little of this to the outer corners of my eyes
5:10i used a Chardonnay in the palette to highlight my brow bone and my inner
5:16corners
5:17this is a makeup geek eyeliner full-spectrum eyeliner in the shape room
5:21area and i'm using this to apply to my waterline and then I take bordeaux on a
5:25pencil brush and kind of just buff it out
5:27I don't want my waterline to look to read so adding the eyeshadow and buffing
5:32that out kind of helps
5:33and then I took cognac and just did the same thing and then I skipped false
5:37lashes and applied tons of mascara for my lips I'm using the Milani lipstick in
5:42the shade
5:43Matt naked and that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching and
5:47please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup
0:10tutorial on this look it's just a really
0:12glittery dark grey gunmetal smokey eye
0:16i'm using the gunmetal stack by not
0:19cosmetics i love their stacks I have all
0:22of them they're so good they are very
0:24very pricey but I feel like melt
0:27cosmetics there so innovative there so
0:29edgy i love Mel as a brand i will say if
0:32you're working with the gunmetal stack
0:34specifically you need to do your
0:36eyeshadow before you do the rest of your
0:37face makeup the last two shades in the
0:40stack these two right here this one is
0:42industrial and this one is gunmetal they
0:44have a lot of fallout a lot of follow
0:48even the top shade there's only one
0:49matte shade in the stack this one has a
0:52lot of fallout as well so you want to
0:54make sure you're doing your eyes first I
0:56did my eyes first and even I have some
0:58fallout on my face
1:00you have to be very careful with these I
1:01don't have that problem with the other
1:03stacks it's just this one specifically
1:04since they're kind of like pressed
1:06glitters their eyeshadows but they're
1:09very glittery and a framling if you want
1:11to see how to get this smoky eye and
1:13then just keep watching
1:14ok so I'm going to jump into eyeshadow
1:17because i already prime my eyelids
1:18eyelids are good to go and i'm going to
1:20take the shade assimilate from the melt
1:23cosmetics gunmetal stack and i'm using a
1:25fluffy brush and I'm just applying this
1:27into my crease and then I'm going to
1:29take my NYX glitter primer and with my
1:31finger i'm going to apply this to my
1:33entire lid
1:34I'm not passing the crease but I'm doing
1:36this because I went in with the shade
1:38gunmetal which is this shade right here
1:40and if i don't go in with a sticky base
1:42or like a glitter primer underneath
1:44there won't be much pigment like it'll
1:46just be a little glitters so adding the
1:48glitter primer really intensifies the
1:50eyeshadow now I'm going back in to
1:53assimilate on a smaller little crease
1:55brush and I'm really just buffing out
1:57this gun metal shade i will say it is a
2:00little bit difficult to work with just
2:01because this is a mat and we're trying
2:03to blend out a glitter it's kind of
2:05difficult but I did take my time with
2:07this i'm just going back and forth with
2:09the shade is so
2:10hey and blending up those edges I
2:12thought the look at me to just a hair of
2:14warmth so on a fluffy brush i took my
2:17physicians formula butter bronzer and I
2:19just blend it out the edges of the shade
2:21assimilate just so everything looks like
2:24a nice gradient to highlight underneath
2:26my brow bone I'm actually taking this
2:27makeup forever and 500 shade and putting
2:31that underneath my problem like i said
2:32to highlight then I went back in to
2:35assimilate on two different brushes and
2:37I'm just buffing out those edges it's
2:39just a lot of blending in the crease and
2:41since we did so much blending a lot of
2:43the glitter fell off so i went back in
2:45with gunmetal and just apply that to my
2:47lids and then I'm jumping into the face
2:50before I finish up the eyes
2:51this is a primer from the brand money
2:53it's their perfect 10 primer serum and
2:56I'm just testing that out right now and
2:57i'm also trying this primer out for the
2:59first time in this video this is the it
3:01cosmetics
3:02bye bye pores primer and so far so good
3:04it really did smooth out the skin i'm
3:07still testing it out but i think i
3:09really like it for foundation i went
3:11with i went in with the Loreal provo
3:14foundation this is the shade tool 3i
3:16believe and it just the undertone isn't
3:19right it doesn't match my skin perfectly
3:21but the formula is pretty good it gives
3:23your skin a natural finish for concealer
3:26i'm going in with my favorite this is
3:27the tart shaped concealer this is in the
3:30shade fair and i'm just highlighting my
3:32face and also covering up my dark
3:35circles and just blending of that in
3:37with a sponge
3:40to set my concealer i'm using the NYC
3:43smooth skin loose translucent setting
3:45powder and just I'm just setting all the
3:48places i apply the concealer because I
3:50don't feel like this foundation needs to
3:52be set the concealer dude so to finish
3:56off the eyes i'm taking a black eyeliner
3:58on my waterline and on my tight line
4:00this is the essence smoky black kajal
4:02fat chubby you know one of those control
4:05things it's really good and so
4:07affordable but for my lower lashline I'm
4:10just taking the shade assimilate and
4:12really blending that out and then I went
4:14into this wet and wild trio called plaid
4:17to the bone and i took the blue color
4:20and the trio and i'm blending this right
4:22on top of the assimilation shade to
4:24create kind of like a blue-gray color
4:25and I just blended that out and then I
4:28took some more of the Knicks glitter
4:30primer and i'm applying that to my inner
4:32corner so that i can go over it with
4:33this shade this one is called harsh tone
4:36white and with a little blush know
4:38little brush i'm applying that to my
4:40inner corners and dragging it onto my
4:42lid as well then i just applied some
4:45mascara and eye popped on some falsies i
4:47use the cocoa falsies in the shade Misha
4:50and that completes the I look for
4:53contouring i am using the cabinet quan
4:56sculpting powder in the shade light just
4:58to give myself a little bit of content
5:00and then I took the physicians formula
5:02butter bronzer on a bigger fluffier
5:05brush to really just bronze up the skin
5:07then for blush i took the Milania Rose
5:13blush in the shade awakening rose and I
5:16pop that on my cheeks i love this blush
5:18i bought mine on Amazon because i
5:20couldn't seem to find it anywhere i
5:21think it was limited edition but it's
5:23beautiful if you can find it get it and
5:26then highlight the tops of my cheekbones
5:27and my nose and all that good stuff i
5:29took the back of champagne pop highlight
5:32and just put in that everywhere as usual
5:35for lips and wanted a peachy color but I
5:37didn't think it was going to be a speech
5:39as this turned out this is the Kylie
5:42liquid lipstick in the shade dirty peach
5:44but it was a little bit to neon for me
5:46like it was a little bit unexpected i
5:47was a whole speech so I decided to take
5:50a nude gloss on top and I apply the dose
5:53of colors gloss in the shade undressed
5:56and then that completes this look
5:58thank you guys so much for watching
5:59please subscribe if you haven't already
6:01and I will see you in my next video bye
0:09so today's video is another makeup tutorial I'm on like makeup tutorial i'm
0:14on a makeup tutorial roll it is on this look right here I haven't used makeup
0:20geek products in awhile so i decided to just bust out my makeup geek eyeshadows
0:24so that
0:26yeah make a week I can't find the words today all the eyeshadows on my eyes are
0:33makeup geek is what I was trying to say it's like an icy green with a really
0:38intense lower lashline i know a lot of people don't really like lower lash like
0:42a super intense or lifetime but i think it's so like captivating i love super
0:48smoky lower lashline so that's why i kept the top really simple no liner like
0:56just like two eyeshadows pretty much and then I focused the drama on the bottom
1:01so yes my hair is a mess and so is the lighting the lighting in this video is
1:05like really off I feel because i'm filming really late at night which are
1:10usually film during the day so I don't have any sunlight at all in my room
1:14right now so I'm sorry that the lighting kind of sucks anyway if you want to get
1:18this look then just keep watching
1:20so for primer i am using the Mac painterly Paint Pot i use this all the
1:26time it masks the veins of Maryland's and I really like that this shadows for
1:31making me call the eyeshadows are from makeup geek
1:33this one is called babyface and i'm just using this to set the excuse my singing
1:39i'm just using that to set down the paint pot now i'm taking high tea i love
1:45this eyeshadow i highly recommend it it's a nice like olive green but it's
1:51really pigmented it's really amazing i don't know i really really love it so
1:55I'm taking one of her oiled eyeshadows and look at that look at that fullness
1:58its amazing by the way i'm recording this voiceover really really really
2:02really late in the middle
2:03the night so my voice is like cracking anyway this foil shadows called charmed
2:08and I started putting it on eyeshadow i mean with a brush and then i just
2:11finished putting it on with my finger
2:14I'm going right back into high tea just to blend everything out and then I'm
2:20going to take ice queen and this is gonna be my brow bone highlight i like
2:24it because it's not a flat white color it has like a sheen to it
2:29ok so this is a brand-new product i just got it
2:32the marc jacobs looks like a pill that's why I was a doing that and see marc
2:38jacobs undercover coconut primer I got it just because it said it had coconut
2:45in it and I feel like I put on a little bit too much this is the first time i
2:48used it and it smells faintly of coconuts not too much but it is really
2:53hydrating it basically feels like a super intense moisturizer I don't know
2:57if it's as good as the two-faced one just yet
3:01and here i am looking for a brush to put on my foundation but yeah let's move on
3:06i'm going to mix these two foundations this is the Too Faced Born This Way and
3:10the look L'Oreal True Match Lumi mentally yes the true match Leumi ok
3:17it's really late guys
3:19I love mixing the two because the two-faced one just gives you a flawless
3:23finish but adding the Loreal one makes it a little bit do here so i noticed
3:29that i didn't really match my neck much i'm not as tan as i usually am so it
3:34didn't match my next I'm like trying to drag it down and I'm like me
3:39yeah the color it's a little off so i'm just going to add a lot more concealer
3:44than usual to try to blend everything out i'm using the Maybelline better skin
3:49concealer I can't stop using this I wasn't a big fan of it at first and now
3:53it's like one of my favorites i cannot solve using it so i'm just applying this
3:58all over my face like I usually do just adding probably a little bit more than
4:03use and with my signal is 217 I am blending all that out
4:10yeah
4:17i'm going to set all of the concealer with the maybelline fit me powder in 135
4:24creamy natural this is a real techniques contour brush by the way and i'm just
4:30using that to set everything ok so I'm gonna finish off my eyes and this part
4:36makes me cringe because you guys know I hate tugging on my eyes and I never
4:39really do but for some reason I did tonight
4:43this is the Milani shadow eyes chubby stick eyeliner thing in black and then
4:49I'm just smudging that out with like a little equal tools brush I'm going to
4:58work on smoking out that lower lashline this is dirty martini it's such a nice
5:02deep green i'm applying that right on top of the eyeliner and I put the black
5:08base so that it can look like a super super dark green so yes I'm just
5:13blending that out with a morphy pencil brush and I'm going to go into high tea
5:17this beautiful like great olive color and putting that right on top and then
5:21I'm just blending everything out for my inner corner highlight I'm using shimma
5:27shimma on a pencil brush and then I want my lower lashes to be like very
5:33volumizing so i'm using the clinic bottom lash mascara because i feel like
5:37it gives my lower lashes a lot of volume and then for my top lashes i just threw
5:45on some L'Oreal telescopic and that completes my eye look a lot of people
5:50complain that I don't wear falsies enough but I just don't wear them all
5:54the time it's not very practical for me i don't know i just don't wear it a lot
5:58but wear them a lot anyway I'm just warming up my skin before i go ahead and
6:03contour using the NYC son and bronze in Montauk bronze and then i'm going to
6:09contour my face
6:10this is the Kevin quan sculpting powder in medium and then contouring with a
6:16more fiemme 510 brush i love this brush to contour with because it doesn't give
6:22you like a super harsh you know nars a brush
6:27no of contour it's a little bit fluffier for blush I'm using makeup geek
6:32spellbound and i'm using the same brush I use the bronze my face with and that
6:37is the real techniques multitask brush for the highlights i am using the buddy

1:17hi that's going into this video
1:22yeah
1:27ok guys so it's gonna get started on this one brand tutorial completely
1:32barren faced and I feel like I look like a damn making more out with his face on
1:36right now
1:37yeah i'm going to start clean slate poreless primer
1:40this is just my silicone e feeling primer for people to have liked more
1:44porous skin
1:46hello me how you doing my name is Manny and I of course problematic
1:50starting in the center just kind of blending outwards so for foundation I'm
1:53gonna be going in with the new Iranian force of the sea foundation retard
1:56obviously the heart one brand tutorial i got this recently when I was in hawaii
1:59was hard and they just launched a huge array of products and the rainforest
2:03foundation was one of them
2:04this is such a beautiful foundation I've worn it twice so far the only thing
2:07about it i don't really like is that I feel like I have to use a lot of
2:12foundation and to get to the coverage that I want because this is more of a
2:15baby
2:15I feel like a natural to medium coverage foundation maybe that's just me
2:19I'm in the shade light medium and natural I'm gonna start pressing in with
2:23the Beauty Blender all over my skin it does give you the most beautiful skin
2:27like appearance of for foundation a very glowing and natural-looking which is
2:31beautiful i love it even when I pile on a shit ton of foundation is still looks
2:36really beautiful really natural which I like
2:38I just like to have to use like to hold syringes of product to get like the
2:42coverage i want you know but then again i am a bully and I want to cover a lot
2:46that was one syringe and only covered up like this area of mine and I need one
2:49more syringe to do with the forehead and the nose
2:53maybe you guys don't have to but I do if your oil you want to go with more of a
2:57mattifying product underneath and set it with powder because it is going to be
3:00pretty glowy
3:03as you can see it does give a beautiful amount of coverage once you later it on
3:06look super super pretty very glowy very natural looking
3:10overall this is a beautiful a foundation that gets truly stunning
3:13I'm gonna go in with the tart I was going to clean water proof 12-hour
3:17concealer i really like this one - I want to use consider many times before
3:21which is a really nice full coverage stick concealer like you can see
3:25freaking full ask coverage is insanity
3:28I'm gonna use too much because this is a very very heavy weight and dense
3:31concealer reminds me of like the seven o'clock concealer like it's that
3:35and
3:35and full ask sick coverage concealer I'm in the shade
3:39fairlight like to highlight with them as well and i'm going to put in areas i
3:43need more coverage as well
3:44ok perfect and now we're going to go in and blend that out with the same and
3:48beauty bar that we just went in with for the face
3:50full ask coverage concealer i really do like this one a lot
3:53ya see that give me your grace that is what you should have so far as nice just
3:58blend it out
3:59highlighted and shit concealer and foundation on
4:03there's a lot of powder let me go with a smooth operator and which is like
4:07they're translucent powder to set the face with I'm gonna put that underneath
4:10the highest just really make sure that everything is set in place underneath
4:14the eye because again this is a very creamy concealer you want to make sure
4:17that it is it will begin to increase on you i can already see some of it wanted
4:21to crease and I'm like no bitch not today
4:23so just kind of going with a little bit of the smooth operator just a very much
4:25small amount because this is a white translucent powder and we don't want any
4:29crazy kind of flashback
4:31you know what I mean you know what I mean I know you do you've seen those
4:34photos of celebrities and you're thinking damn bitch poor yo
4:37yeah and then I'm gonna take a huge brush this is the morphe 41 just a big
4:41fluffy brush and kind of big fluffy brush of work i'm just going to dip it
4:43in a little bit of what i have on the cap of the powder and I just gonna go
4:47everywhere all over my face again just a very light layer just to make sure that
4:50everything is set in place this is a setting powder
4:53I wanted to make sure everything is nicely set
4:56so now i'm going with the BB powder by hard this is one of the newest
5:00foundation powders that they just launched its a creamy powder foundation
5:04and it's a light-medium neutral that's a shame that we end up going in with
5:07haven't tried to see this is first time this little tab for me and let's make
5:10little 10 below 10 so we're going with that same big be 41 and 0 from the
5:15outside of the face and then go in from there
5:18so like the darkest color gets deposited on like the hollows of my face already
5:22this isn't the main colors the grumbler shit
5:26it's fine we'll live at the end of the world if your little more tan than you
5:30are suppose to be this powder is pretty the hook up to take that down the neck
5:35because I do want to match my next to my face
5:38so the skin is looking pretty nice i'm not gonna lie i feel like this video
5:40with garlic this one brand tutorial is also like a first impressions video
5:43because i haven't tried a lot of these products like
5:46not try it a lot of these things so bear with me
5:49so how's it going with the hardest contour kit just like the cute little
5:53round 1 this might have you and I really do love it
5:55I'm gonna take a key to brush my morphe you brought up the skin I'm gonna take
5:58this really warm bronzy color so like vanilla and chocolate
6:04so then what ever get to the bronzing part i want to talk to you guys
6:07this like the bronzing part is where I start to get a little like stir crazy
6:11and i wanna be like you guys like what you guys doing today cause you're a
6:14sweet going like what's going on you know what I mean I don't know what it is
6:17about the bronzer that makes me get stir crazy but it does it truly does this is
6:21like literally the point of like no return for me where I'm like hey guys
6:24what are we doing
6:25ok cool what leave me a comment like I'm so weird i don't know why i almost
6:29forgot to bronze up my right cheek
6:31ok man you just walk around fucking won bronze or cheap one cheek bronzer
6:35what and then I'm going with the makeup the contouring brush and take a little
6:38bit of the darkest shade in the contrary it's just a little bit of contouring not
6:43too much as you want to go a little bit
6:46not to him not too easy calm down
6:49why am I talking like this what this brush like to go in first and they do a
6:52nice layer down and then I'll start buffing up so there's no harsh lines
6:56between the bronzer and the contour
6:59I'm not going to let people do like the harsh line but i'm just going to blend
7:03the two together let them marinate haven't done a 12 total in so long
7:09you have to know it's been so fucking long way since I've done one brand in
7:11the last night it will take forever and that was like Ohio go dude
7:15it goes a while so I'm excited to be doing this so many people have been
7:18asking me to 21 and it's finally here
7:21there's a spot on the right side of my face it's right here and rejects all
7:26pigment like whenever I'm bronzing on my skin or contouring like a rejected like
7:30I have to go over it so many times to try to even get the slightest color
7:33payoff there
7:34it's the weirdest thing you guys have that like where there's a spot on your
7:37face on your skin that literally rejects pick me and it doesn't want to take any
7:42color
7:43it's the weirdest thing it's so fucking annoying is what it is

8:55pretty pink champagne and the middle one is like more time at yellow and that's
9:00more like for the other I think I don't know I'm kind of confused by that when

9:48stunning
9:49it's still fucking gorge trying to get more to pinky highlighters and find a
9:52dive into the world a little bit but I think it looks to be pretty cool so we
9:55have to face done that is it for the face I want to keep it like this i think
9:59it's really freaking good
10:00so I'm gonna go ahead and start with the eyes now let's get his eyes so I had no
10:04idea that tart even didn't I primer or like brow products like whatsoever i dug
10:09through my room like hardcore looking at all my PR something I found some stuff
10:12to use some pretty stoked about it like I didn't feel it was not expecting that
10:15at all
10:16so I found this tart the brow architect by pencil and it looks like the new
10:20anastacio brow definer like I've had this for like a year
10:25so I mean guitar diverse to fucking know i'm going to the shade deep I've never
10:30tried this not even once i have no idea how this is gonna work
10:33I was going to run this through my brows I don't feel like this puts a lot of
10:37product down though is also might be too fucking life my brows you guys like to
10:41watch these videos because I don't know what I'm doing with products that I've
10:45never tried before
10:46haha it's like this me back up if you guys have tried any of the tart brow
10:49stuff
10:50let me know in the comments below what you do like from them might come to the
10:53brows but I haven't tried any of the brown stuff whatsoever
10:55I don't have more brow products but it's the only one I have personally so let me
10:58know in the comments because I've tried anything else that they might have
11:01okay so I'm gonna keep it at this some nice furry brow
11:05how's it look be honest with me okay it just looks really light
11:09cool that's going to prime the is now I have the tart clean slate 360 creases
11:13primer I've never tried this memory for it Larry first time ever for suppression
11:17let's see how goes it comes out like a little white kind of paste ok let's try
11:21it out
11:21how is he like sunscreen so for the bodies were going to go in with the
11:24tartlet in balloon pilot just like that easy natural part of the ice i'm not
11:28going to do anything
11:29intense with the shadow what I want to do is a really cool different kind of a
11:33liner instead so i'm going to go very natural on the eye for things were going
11:37to grab a morph ep14
11:40the shade charmer charmers are very just white beige color and that's gonna go on
11:44the brow bone just to highlight the brow bone a little bit
11:47so now we're gonna do for the eyes and we're going to go in with a mixture of
11:50flower child and smarty pants
11:52a very light amount of those guys not on a e27 brush my morphe not just going to
11:57go into the crease because this look is solely focused on the liner but i do
12:01want to keep the crease a little more defined and whatnot so I think these
12:06colors mix will be really really really pretty perfect so now with Morsi and 433
12:10minute take a little bit of sweetheart
12:13actually that was like a nice dusty rose color that's going to go on the outer
12:17corner
12:18push that in to the crease super nice just dusty rose ish color I love that
12:23dusty rose like oh just zeros anything obsessed and then i'm going to go in
12:28with a little bit of color
12:30rebel which is like a chocolaty Brown and that's just going to very very very
12:34outer corner just a very small tiny amount of it nothing too crazy and
12:38taking that you 27 just blending that into the crease a little bit as well as
12:42keeping it very concentrated out here in the outer corner though not taking it
12:44too far in and then going in with a t14 one more time I'm going to grab charmer
12:48again that the collector on the brow bone
12:50I'm gonna put on the lid light layer of that all over the lid to really brighten
12:55and awaken the eye
12:56so for the shadow part we are done we're good on the shadows we're going to keep
12:59it at that so now for the fun liner aspect of it i'm gonna be going in with
13:02the new clay pot in mint gonna take that on a nice little tart brush and I'm
13:06going with this nice mint jelly laning

13:27so cute like I'm obsessed
13:29why do you look a little bit of black underneath it like make it look more
13:31sharp and defined on the outer corner
13:33I just got the new so fine liner it's literally like the skinniest even see
13:37like you need to you can you can you see how small this tip is look at my I
13:39compared to it

1:19cool packaging like I did last time this
1:21is the cute little box the chi shadow
1:23pressed powder eyeshadow palette as you
1:25can see this is a rose gold finish on
1:28the outer packaging this time and then
1:30this one is named aspect to the last
1:31palette as well except this one is more
1:33of a rose tone that drips to it which is
1:35absolutely stunning and i love it
1:36just like last time I love the packaging
1:38that was so innovative and so-called
1:39some unique i love actually
1:41differentiated this palette with the
1:42last one by doing the different-colored
1:44oil drips to open up the palate same
1:46thing exact same component as the last
1:48county Palatine shades no mirror in the
1:50palette I wish it did have it this
1:51retails for $42 and we'll let you guys
1:53know whether or not i think this call is
1:55worth the price or not don't have done
1:58is worth it ok first shade first this is
2:00the shade and naked watching my finger
2:02it's very very very soft and lightweight
2:04and watch it with my hand to see that so
2:07basically it's a very very lightweight
2:09shimmer this is actually not my favorite
2:11shade in the entire Bunch actually it's
2:12actually
2:13my least favorite shade in the entire
2:14budget it's a very just lightweight tan
2:16shimmer color it's not like shimmery
2:18words like BAM shimmer it's like a light
2:19subtle like Sheen to the look at some
2:22everything but i believe that she did
2:24create the shadow in mind of people that
2:26wanted a very lightweight like light
2:28shadow on the lid which totally makes
2:30sense for me personally I just know I'll
2:32never use it so it's like it's annoying
2:33to me but it is a beautiful color it's
2:35just not my cup of tea
2:38cool equals the next shadow is going to
2:40be the shade a beach which is beautiful
2:42orangi tan brown shade right here just
2:45watching my hands feel it always feels
2:47fucking good just watching my finger
2:49right here beautiful it is BU to fall
2:56oh my gosh I really like the shape so
2:58much as no patchiness in this for me
3:00there's no passion as you can see that
3:01you can see there's no streaks in my
3:03hand it's a straight-up swatch no
3:05streaks it is in my crease and they
3:07looked great it blended fantastically so
3:09i really have no complaints is a very
3:10nice burnt orange tan color and that is
3:13a win for me guys ago that is a go next
3:17sheet is the shade at penny and this is
3:18a very rustic orange shade so so pretty
3:22to go right into orange watch over here
3:23come on
3:28so pigmented on my goodness the shadows
3:31are extremely smooth extremely soft i
3:34feel like the mats and this one are
3:35better than the maps in the last palette
3:37because again they are smoother softer
3:39they have less kick back and I really
3:41really like that this shade penny is a
3:42win for me is also in my crease right
3:44now it's like the orange shade you guys
3:45see my crease i love a nice rusty orange
3:48red tone that matter i love that
3:51next we have this shade LA which is this
3:53really pretty copper bronze shade is
3:56watch it this one feels so fucking good
3:59look at this look at this fucking shade
4:02this is a boiled finish what you guys
4:04know I'm screaming 400 bog look up that
4:11is a beautiful color is actually the
4:14color I'm going on my later right now i
4:15use it with a brush I didn't use of my
4:17fingers and it was it's this pigmented
4:18so I'm very very very much impressed
4:20that is my shit i love that shapes so so
4:22much
4:23so far the only clothes that i do not
4:24like is naked
4:26that's one of the four every other color
4:28is so far has been a go so next is the
4:30shade burgundy which is a very pretty
4:31pink it's actually literally like a pink
4:34a raspberry icee beautiful beautiful
4:38raspberry pink shade it's not bringing
4:40me whatsoever it's like a pink raspberry
4:43I really feel like highly picked it up
4:44in this formula impressed even fucking
4:48brain so that shade of Burgundy is
4:50another go it's absolutely beautiful it
4:51feels very very creamy and it doesn't
4:53pick up our like the other shades work
4:55so i definitely do think that this
4:56palette is already so much better than
4:58the last palette the last one I did like
5:00I just don't think was worth the money
5:01but so far this one is actually worth
5:03the money to me
5:04so we just watched five of the shadow so
5:05let's see the other four and see how
5:06they play out so now here is the shade
5:08do by filling it with my finger another
5:11beautiful foiled feeling fucking
5:13gorgeousness what it looks like i'll say
5:18the shades like a very pretty foiled
5:19rose shade as again a little bit of pink
5:22reflect a little bit of gold reflect so
5:24it's like a rose gold but much more rows
5:26than gold
5:26so I would say another banger is a
5:28beautiful shade i really wanted to put
5:29this on all over my lid but the golden
5:31was really just speaking to me so I
5:33don't you fucking call you know I was
5:35like the shimmers in this palette so
5:36much more so much more than the last guy
5:38like these tumors are actually like
5:40shimmering and intense other ones
5:41weren't as intense for me and I love of
5:43intense bold reflection next she is a
5:46shade of brick and this is another match
5:48shade this is a really pretty red in
5:50around this is much more brown though
5:52this might be a Swiss chocolate by Mac
5:54I'm just watch it right next to Dubai as
5:59the fucking horrible swag me try the
6:00king and try that again
6:03so what she looks like right here it's a
6:04very pretty red and brown again very
6:08similar to Mac swiss chocolate it's
6:09literally like the same fucking guard me
6:11it's hilarious actually on the outer
6:13corner of my eyes today to blend in with
6:15that really pretty penny shade it just
6:18looks so so nice and I like the blends
6:21so well the shadows here the mats are
6:23much softer than the last one which I
6:25feel is odd because you when it's softer
6:28there's more kick back but there's less
6:30came back in this palette that was last
6:31one I don't know I don't you did it
6:33it's like about next to the shade of New
6:34York and this is a what is this feeling
6:36it feels like a fucking
6:38just talking blue just focus group
6:41that's going to watch right yeah I can
6:43see that right there beautiful
6:47this is a true Toby bronze shade much
6:50more foiled the other politicians it's
6:52not as intense training and other colors
6:54are but it is another beautiful shade
6:56it's a really pretty deep bronze gold
6:59unless you have to hold gold so pretty
7:02another banger though I do think this is
7:04a really pretty color I want to put this
7:05all over my lid as well but i only have
7:07one leg
7:08I can't put that many colors I mean
7:10isn't New York is another go
7:12I don't know I'm saying that's ago but
7:13that's just my thing today and last but
7:15not least this is the shade almond and
7:17this is a really pretty dark dark dark
7:19very plush brownie reminds me a lot of
7:22Aphrodite from my palette on this
7:24beautiful deepened Flemish brown so
7:29pretty
7:30only very very very soft lightweight
7:32matte shade it's not intense by any
7:35means it doesn't feel bad and feel gross
7:37it's a very soft feeling which i really
7:38really enjoy it when it is almond and
7:40braker actually really really similar
7:42the only off by a couple of tones like
7:44they're very very very racist comment on
7:46the outer corner of my eye to deepen
7:47everything I don't have any black are
7:49different shadows on my crease or
7:51anything like that to make it a deep it
7:52was just using almond and it really did
7:54work to make it look nice and dark and
7:56intense and a lot of depth to look so
7:58again almond is another banger I think
8:00that turn out beautifully and this is
8:02the final look using the Kylie cosmetics
8:05burgundy palette obviously i'm wearing
8:07lashes right now and have liner on and
8:08add a little bit of highlight the inner
8:10corner and to the brow bone because the
8:12shadow naked in this palette is not my
8:13favorite the lashes i'm wearing actually
8:15enjoy this video
8:16Miami by lily lashes because you're
8:17curious why lashes i'm wearing Lily
8:19lashes may I mean you can use the code
8:20many ways to have somebody interested in
8:22it I just like this pair a lot of very
8:24wispy intense and they're so glam so
8:28again all in all this palette retails
8:29for $42 do I think it's worth the price
8:31i do this is actually a good how I
8:34really do like this one and I know I
8:35actually be using this a lot more often
8:37that i was going to use the other
8:38palette the only shot i don't like is
8:40the shade naked and that's just not my
8:42cup of tea
8:42I don't like shaped like that i don't
8:43like a very soft like almost not there
8:45shimmer I want either matter i want
8:47intense shine I don't want anything
8:49between that's just my personal
8:50preference though but i do think that
8:51this palette is actually worth the 42
8:52bucks
8:53unlike last time I didn't think it was
8:55worth it but this one I think is looking
8:57at just so it's so pretty
8:59these are kinda tones i love these are
9:00so beautiful to me this is like my
9:03fucking bread-and-butter this i write
9:04out on my bread-and-butter as I can
9:07remember I do think it is worth the
9:08price and i would buy this
9:10personally I was gonna buy it just so
9:12happened to be sent to me so I'm
9:13impressed with this pilot much more than
9:15I am impressed with the last one I feel
9:16like she picked it up and it's just
9:18better just what it is it's better it's
9:20actually worth the price is time and the
9:21other one is ending was so that's my

1:14like one right here is a little thumb
1:15click it and comment if you guys liked it as well I would really appreciate
1:17that yeah without further ado let's go ahead and get started on this one brand
1:20look I make a fabric
1:22hey guys okay cool so it's going to start this bad boy off
1:25I'm 15 had to be filming this video and she wasn't so long ago but you know what
1:29that are like the numbers when I only thing
1:32ok so it's going to start with the face of course my face is completely barely a
1:36moisturizer on and i'm gonna go ahead and start with primer for today I'm
1:39going to using the step 1 equalizers I think they are such amazing primers for
1:43the face i think they're freakishly bomb
1:45I'm gonna take the step 1 Glaser in smoothing and I'm gonna go in my t-zone
1:48this is such a great smoothing primer a type of the appearance of pores like
1:52stupid bomb
1:52I'm just on my nose and just go with one finger and like press it around and you
1:56are pores are big ass back and pulls of death
1:58that's what right ok and then we're going to take the hydrating one for the
2:02perimeter of my face but I feel like it helps my face like look less cracking
2:05less cakey so i put this on spots i have got more fine lines and wrinkles like
2:09this area right here is a smile too much
2:12the equal wages from AFF are meant to be used together with fellow equalizers so
2:15it's totally fine if you mix them together because it's going to totally
2:18work out
2:18in your favor trust a bitch cuz mama knows ok oh he's a profound you should
2:22i'm going to take me make a favor Ultra HD foundation is a new one they just
2:25launched and i'm going to shade 140 equals y 305 make a favor numbering is
2:29not my favorite because i think it's really confusing gonna take two pumps on
2:32the back of my hand a lofty popli is making two and a half
2:35okay i'm gonna take a Beauty Blender i was going to press out all over the skin
2:38I just started on my cheeks because that's what I like the most horse again
2:42and I like to fill up my pores with some foundation is a good for your skin
2:45problem not probably fucking not
2:47I think the coverage is better than the old one I think this one also lasts
2:50longer on the face in the old HD still make up for ever get done did good on
2:54camera wasn't freaking filming but what i did was i did an excessive step you
2:58don't need to this whatsoever i took the Makeup Forever HD stick it's more of a
3:01full coverage foundation stick and i put this on my cheeks
3:03this is going to give you more coverage this is a full coverage stick that gives
3:06you like really glowy like satin finish and we're gonna put in the t-zone the
3:10kind of highlight the face a little bit and then blend it out with the Beauty
3:12Blender you feel it blends out like so freakishly bomb is stupid again that
3:17step was not necessary but you know might have how to do it because Mama's
3:21extra a month extra
3:22now i'm gonna take some concealer I'm gonna take the full cover creme and
3:25shake number three this is like to have to make up for ever's though this was
3:28going to use and i'm going to use that with the beauty blender because this
3:30bitch is folk over to the but uh huh i'm going to press that in underneath the
3:33eye
3:34it's so pretty though oh my gosh i'm going to highlight with this - but use
3:37it very sparingly you don't need so much of it so don't like use a lot of if you
3:41don't need a lot of it
3:42take my beauty blender and blend out so you can also pick up the excess product
3:45because it is a full-coverage concealer and it's a cream so you don't want to
3:48work with it and you want to set it off so quickly
3:50I'm gonna take this eyeshadow makeup forever it's this one right here I
3:53really know the name of it i mean it on the back but it's kind of a bitch to
3:55find so I'm just going to leave it in the description box down below as an
3:58eyeshadow but it's kind of a yellow base i'm gonna use that to set my under eye
4:01me might as well you know what the powder to fuck about her feel that I
4:04shadows are so ridiculously nice spicy no rules to it you know anything . a
4:08little thing look makeup every little dated for me please tell me that you
4:12super cool PR think manatees were sold separately like us could buy these other
4:16things like your favorite influencers faces on them not be so freaking cool i
4:19don't know i think that's such a cool thing and I think it's so cool and
4:21makeup ever sent these out to people
4:22I'm so honored to have been sent one I think maybe forever is amazing
4:26forever if you want to have a collab great so we are now concealed and we
4:30have found each night and we are good to go now i want to go and set my face
4:33i'm going to make up for ever HD high definition powder this is the loose when
4:36I wish I had the pressed one but i don't but I'm gonna take a little bit on the
4:39back of the cap and take that with a more fiji 0 my holy grail powder brush
4:43just it's so good because you see pricing
4:47bubble bubble toil and trouble don't want to put too much fun because it's
4:51going to give you think that white flash back because it is a silica powder to
4:54have to be really conscious of that but just going to start pressing over the
4:57face with the HD powder hook
5:02I think that HD powder looks so pretty
5:05I'm going to take the maker pro finishing powder and 1 18 and I'm going
5:08to do on my neck just to kind of match my neck little bit better to my face
5:11this powder is just like a foundation powder and it's actually really really
5:14nice i use on my face sometimes too
5:16it's going to run that on my neck just down my neck a little bit on my ears and
5:20yeah that's all I got
5:22ok cool so now i'm going to bronze up the thing i'm going to make it forever
5:25map bronze powder and shade 20
5:27I talked about this before my channel for I think it's such an amazing amazing
5:30amazing bronzer and take down the morphe to come to run that in my bronze and
5:35areas
5:35it's not too warm to cool I think it's so beautiful and I like that it's very
5:39buildable this is such a buildable bronzer it's not like so happy or
5:42anything like that
5:43I just think it's so nice little bit on my chin a little bit down my fucking
5:48chin
5:50what is this on my chin yeah bitchin
5:53ja raha otherwise fucking job oh my god ax
5:59alright cool so we have some chronic like we have some nice dimension to the
6:06skin that the bronze look so freaking pretty interesting the bronze look so
6:09gorgeous so not for blush I'm gonna take the sculpting brush in the shade tents
6:12like a very nice pastel e pink color I'm going to just a little bit of online no
6:16not a light blush sleeping
6:18it's such a really pretty like fleshy kind of pink it's like so like you know
6:23don't know what that noise was but that's what I'm feeling
6:25perfect we are blushed I thought I want to write something about my start
6:29getting more like diva as you know like a lot of people have been noticing my
6:32videos like i'll be like in boy mode
6:33I'm like super like you guys that like doesn't like super children as soon as I
6:36start getting laid the foundation on associate the highlighter on like a
6:40bitch
6:41hey Carl what kind of thing you know so now for the house later I'm gonna be
6:43taking the pro sculpting 20 in the shade number two which um hi
6:47obsession with the on a morphine m510 brush just to highlight the skin I'm
6:52taking that gold color to highlight
6:53oh I'm just gonna go in I love this highlighter so much
6:56Joe how good it is a joke why don't you just more i forgot i don't you just
7:01enough
7:01okay great perfect so the face is basically done this is what it looks
7:04like the face is complete
7:05let's go and start getting into the eyes now okay so basically i saw and i did a
7:10look I did like almost the whole entire I look already but I hated it so much
7:14like my liner looks so fucking shitty that I took it all off and reapply
7:18concealer and everything so if you guys see like anything like cracking in my
7:20concealer it's because i like it off like this whole area already and i just
7:23replied so hopefully doesn't look too bad but I'm doing this again
7:26Alex look with shitty haven't seen me to all the time ok so whatever do now for
7:30that I love already primed my eyes and I already did my eyebrows off camera using
7:33the concealer and I used to that shadow that one shadow and I pressed it over it
7:37as well as the browse the brows I didn't have anything for making february's for
7:40the brow so just like you know what we just do them off camera because I didn't
7:42have anything from them
7:43I wanted like a little bit of browser but they have the Aqua seal and I didn't
7:46really want to use the questions that i want to go to flee
7:48so I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna take the e 27 my morphe and I running in my
7:52bronzer and i'm going to be using that as my transition shade know honestly
7:56like how i feel about bronze I just feel like they're big ass eyeshadows you can
7:59use bronzer as much as you want honestly as a shadow
8:01there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever I'm gonna run
8:03into my crease and your I should look something like this is a nice just
8:06diffused crease
8:07I went well sony oh I'm gonna go and take this beautiful cranberry shade
8:12right here trying Morello
8:14I think of everything everything on this morphine for three and very small amount
8:17of it i want to go to jam with this color because you can look real pink
8:21real quick okay
8:22I honestly love this color so much so it's like stupid how much I love it
8:26beautiful as soon as I saw it I was like I mean he's that just feather it forward
8:29towards the front of the eye i'm just being very light hand with I'm not
8:32taking too much most of it is deposited on the outer corner
8:35you're seeing this shade is so freaking beautiful it's stupid
8:38so I think that you 27 again and just blend out that color
8:42I'm going to be going in with this gorgeous palette for making favorites
8:45like the number one pallet and i'll take that middle shade is like a really
8:47beautiful like taupe color and I'm cheating on my finger
8:50I'm gonna play sat on my lady it's so step knee and then I grab the darker one
8:58right here with my finger again and just put it on the outer corner like just
9:01very slightly
9:02well just for some dimension on the lid still just a more dimension and then
9:06that same for 3 i'm just going to blend out the edges a little bit more and then
9:09with that same power I'm gonna take a little bit of the black on the import 33
9:12and then just place it on the outer corner only just for some more dimension
9:16again all this looks to be nice and blended very well you have a little bit
9:21of that pink like cranberry shades shining through not too much but i like
9:25it and then taking that you 27 again and blending out the edges taking that same
9:29banana in shade right here
9:30I'm gonna toss them out on the brow bone again just kind of clean up what I kind
9:34of messed up and with like the blending and whatnot highlight all over again you
9:37know on a more fee and 422 letting it downwards and the eyes top of the actual
9:42something like this
9:43I really like how this one turned out much better than the last one sheet damn
9:46shit
9:46okay great so now the tops of the thighs are done i think it came out way better
9:49than the other i did like oh my gosh you actually saw if you guys follow me on
9:52snapchat you guys saw it i bet you guys are like buff huh
9:55it was not you whatsoever so let me just go and finish the bottom of the high now
9:57I'm gonna take that same map browser
9:59I think if ever any e36 pencil brush my morphe I'm just gonna run underneath
10:02that I you need me to meet with is just going to be our transition
10:05I'll see we're not going to do very much to the bottom lash line because I wanted
10:07to be just focus on the top of the time or I'm gonna go back in with the artists
10:10palette
10:11I'm
10:11to take this shade down here one that we put on the outer corner of all right I'm
10:14going to place that on the outer corner of my lower lash line with that same
10:1736-pound like i'll give you that chance like dimension but it has like a really
10:20cool sheen to it as well and then just kind of feather that forward justin is
10:24really pretty coppery Brown shooting now with the same 36 brush just kind of dust
10:28the bitch off on a little drugged or something on your pants whatever take
10:31this icy shade right here and I'll put that on the inner corner of my eye as my
10:35inner corner highlight kids has like a pinky tone to it
10:39what the fuck and you know that that's cool okay great so I have curled my
10:42lashes already off camera just because it's curling your lashes you know you
10:45are you know how to do that so I'm going to be smoky shop again and just put some
10:48of that on my lashes I've never actually tried this mascara before but let's

0:55and yeah it's going to get into this video
0:59yeah
1:04ok so we are back with another man you anyway palette tutorial so excited about
1:10these well guys I just really really excited to be filming these so we're
1:13gonna do as many as we possibly can when we can
1:15so I have an idea in my head of what I've done it too so it's going to make
1:19that happen
1:20just go right into it works and jump right into the tutorial hop on in
1:24we are going to gray of beaches and cream on a more for me 27 brushes just
1:29going to go everywhere that I wasn't what i want to do a dramatic liner so I
1:32want the lid and the crease to be really really soft and not so intense
1:36a little bit on the lid whatever you just have left on the lid i'm already
1:39primed by the way I have a primer on and so don't even worry about it if you're
1:42thinking
1:43manual what are you doing bitch almost primed perfect what we have so far it's
1:48not very easy
1:49basically looks like nothing is on your lid crease so we're gonna be more p.m.
1:53for 33 brush and a frappe was not very nice maple brown color and I couldn't go
1:57very slightly into the crease
1:59not a lot though the reason I'm putting frappe into the crease because i want to
2:03give a little bit of dimension to the crease not that much and I want to keep
2:06on the outer corner specifically just super chill and not too much and then e
2:1127 and blending that out a little bit just cause I want it to be too hard I
2:14just want a little bit of dimension in the crease and that is about it
2:19so this is what you preach it look like very easy and nothing to him just a
2:22little bit of color in the outer corner and then we're going with the fun part
2:26we're going to be grabbing Mars of course that's my red shadow and then the
2:29palate and then you got any language that you have
2:32i'm going to be taking it the more feet and 51
2:35whoa what are you going to be taking the more p.m.
2:38158 which that's a nice liner brush is what it looks like it's really really
2:42good it's very small defined and i'm just going to pack that onto the
2:46eyeliner as if it's as if it's a gel liner pretend that the shadows gel liner
2:49and that's all we're going to do a zoom in a little bit more
2:52so you guys can see a little bit closer be careful with dipping into march
2:54because it is such a pigmented a shadow like I'm not kidding
2:58it's fucking crazy and we're going to act on it as our liner
3:04yeah
3:05ok and now we're going to make a little wing with it is whale just kind of
3:12sketch it out first
3:13the wing is gonna be intense because this is the main portion of this entire
3:17looks so don't be afraid to make it like a la boum wing
3:21did you know i am afraid you didn't know if you get too freaked out about doing
3:28this you can always use tape and tape is a really good method to use when doing
3:31this you can just pound on a bunch of shadow and have like the tape make the
3:34wing short but i'm just gonna use a little bit concealer to clean up after
3:36anyway so don't worry about it if you think it's like a little intense for you
3:41you can do it I promise luckily the shadow is so fucking pic with you that I
3:49can just glide it like as if it's an eyeliner see that shit to use even looks
3:53so sick ok next time then
3:55okay great so we have both of the eyes done at the top at least
3:59so this might be taking manual you have a little bit more color in your crease
4:02then what we remember while a bitch fuck step
4:05ok so what happened with I was curling my lashes on camera and I was calling
4:09really close to the lash like the lash line of course
4:12and like I stopped calling and then i went i moved upwards to curl like again
4:16and then some of the part on the top of this transferred to my lid the red and
4:21I'm like okay so i had to just going to work with some of the right in the
4:24crease is kind of blend it out
4:26I think it looks totally cool i love it i think it looks awesome
4:30I am not mad at the mistake you know sometimes mistakes are really cool but
4:33you want to keep it like dark brown
4:35just keep the five pain there be careful with the left with this because it will
4:38transfer
4:38apparently so - be careful with it but if you don't mind a little bit of pink
4:42in the crease
4:43I don't at all I looking so whatever type on house of lashes iconix on the
4:48eyes
4:48I'm starting to really like these lashes a lot like I've been wearing a lot more
4:51recently and I think they look really really really pretty special with this
4:54look when I'm just doing a liner basically the whole look
4:58so yeah I like it okay great so it's going to want to the bottom lash line
5:01I already did the mascara knowledge it off camera the we're going to grab
5:05Knicks cocoa eyeliner eyeliner and lip liner pencil course we're going to use
5:11cocoa lip liner
5:13and I'm going to the waterline this color is so freaking pretty it's like a
5:18red into Brown will take a little bit on the lashes as well and then just grab
5:23any pencil dress I'm grabbing the e36 buy morphine just kind of blending that
5:26out a little bit before it completely dries
5:29I'm gonna grab a little bit of Sora on that same 36 and blend that out a little
5:32bit just to give me some nice warm like cocoa color back
5:36I'm gonna grab a more feet 40 3 and take Aphrodite which is the dark plum not
5:41gonna go too close to the lash line
5:42just give me a really good amount of definition and dimension
5:46just make sure it's a lot darker by the lash line and then once you pack on with
5:51that color go ahead and blend out with the e36 again just to make sure there's
5:56no harsh edges as I was blending away my lower lash line
6:01I decided you know what i want to do a darker in a rim
6:04not really i'm not really feeling the like reddish brown i'm going with more
6:08of a true brown i'm going to mr. right now by the bomb in the shade
6:13bill a bill I don't feel like it's a little bit too
6:16right on the water line you know I don't look like I have a disease not feeling
6:20that look right now so we should go in with that right now I'm just not very
6:23lightly go over the color already have down just make a little more chocolaty
6:26and not has read and I'm feeling a lot more
6:30I am feeling that a lot more and that is the final I like this one looks like
6:34this is going to turn out to be i absolutely love it
6:36such an easy look you guys want you can always highlight the inner corner of
6:39your eye as well
6:40should we do it I think we should come on I'm gonna take the morphe am3 26 and
6:46Artemis and just apply a little bit to the inner corner
6:49it was a little puppets on a son named and now we're calling it a day

0:15you guys enjoy your scene because that's what this video is I've been getting
0:18tons of requests to do more different dramatic colorful looks and i know this
0:21is not think the most dramatic look at that most colorful look but i think it
0:25turned out really really cool and I feel like it's it is a very wearable sunset I
0:28and because we are getting more into spring and summer I wanted to go with
0:32some spring summer e-type looks

1:17what's up I'm anyway and it's my child and let's go and get into this really
1:21cool sunset e-type I
1:30so it's going to get into this video I already did my face basically I was like
1:35you know what I'm doing my face a little blah lately and just switch it up a
1:37little bit and have one of the new more college I really want to use today so
1:40I'm like let me incorporate that somehow in today's videos that's kind of what
1:44I'm doing today
1:45just for reference already pie my lids and I have my eyebrows done already so
1:48that we're just going to go in with shadow solely i'm so excited using this
1:51palette i'm so stoked i literally just got it today and I cannot handle like a
1:55happy today it's this bad boy
1:5730 50 in all mad are you joking
2:01I'm so excited to be using this I'm gonna go in with this shade right here
2:05it's a nice like to come mustard the orange to master any orange honey morphy
2:1027 and we're gonna run out into the crease as a nice transition shade for
2:14the rest of the shades that we're going to be going anyway
2:16shit is peg mented right away on my gun I'm taking that all the way into inner
2:20corner and I'm doing windshield wiper motions as well as circular motions
2:24towards the end or have a little bit extra skin to work with out here
2:28this is a transition color so again you don't need me to like meet with it
2:31whatsoever
2:32once we have that nice mustard yellow orange shade down I'm gonna be taking a
2:35new make a deep shadow called the tux in son
2:37it's just a nice like just like a nice corally pink shade which i think will go
2:41so nice with my idea of what I want this look to be um I'm going with the
2:45morphine and 43 and just blend that into the crease basically right on top of
2:49that morphine shadow just to give it some more dimension last time i'm going
2:55slightly lower than I have that orange shade but still like basically on top of
2:59it just to give it another added dimension to look and if you feel like
3:02you're going to hand with the tux and sun or whatever color you using i'll
3:06just go back in with that burnt orange shade from morphe on the same brush and
3:11blend up those edges to make sure that we do have a nice gradient and blend and
3:14you should have something like this
3:16now the tux and son is now a little bit lower and you can see there's a nice
3:19like orangie pinky gradients coming on and I'm digging it
3:24I'm thinking okay so now i think i'm gonna go in with this really cool darker
3:28burnt orange shade down here and that same morphe 35o palette and she just
3:33looks really nice like a burnt dark pinky-orange i'm judith on the same am
3:37or PM 433 brush
3:39and we're going to put that into the crease on the more outer corner and I
3:42can go as far in
3:43I just want to keep it on the outer corner mostly to make sure there's a
3:46nice gradient with this look I know I want to go with the shower because it's
3:49super nice pretty dark orange pink shade as you can see he's having a little bit
3:54more dimension to it is giving it more like a Firebird kind of feeling you know
3:58I'm keeping that lower than the rest of the colors between every single step
4:02just go back in and playing with a t27 to make sure there's no harsh lines or
4:06edges so what you continue to blend you have something like this so far
4:10so now we're going to take this shape make it was a brand new one from them is
4:13called fashion addict which is a nice just purple like a light lavender purple
4:17shade on a morphine 36 and go on the outer corner of my eye
4:21so we can have some more dimension and depth to this look I wanted to be like a
4:23really cool like sunset I like i was saying we're gonna have purple out here
4:27give it a different look we're actually going to combine that with taboo also by
4:31making because i feel like this color it's not dark enough and i want to a
4:34little bit darker purple
4:35I'm gonna go about two-thirds in keeping this area is completely bare because
4:39that's a br lid shade and you have something like this so far not going to
4:43do that I the great so that's what you look like now once you have everything
4:47blended out so now for the lip color i decided i'm going with a new shadow by
4:50mikey called Sin City and it's just a nice just boring g gold and all I can't
4:55really explain it as like an orange gold shade on a morphine am
4:58- 10 I just found out about this brush I just been using a non-stop so I'm going
5:03to load up the brush I'm going to look at the shadow but the brush and I'm
5:06going to pack up on all over the lid
5:09it's a really pretty orange e-gold I thought would go so nicely with this
5:12look I feel very festive I feel like a toucan awesome she should have something
5:15like this now what is all blended out
5:18so now we're going with the bottom lash line you see I kind of finish off with
5:20the top but right now i'm going to the bottom lashes I feel like it was just
5:23much easier together and have the shadows out so why not you know
5:26so I'm going to do is go back in with the Tuscan Sun shadow one more time on
5:30the e36 and start taking that out here and basically doing what i did on the
5:34top on the bottom lash line and literally just combining the two
5:38I would take it pretty far into the inner corner I want to look like the
5:41blend never stopped just can't just always just go up together you know
5:44so now we go back in with the fashion addict shadow on a morphine be 43 and
5:49that's going to go on an outer
5:50owner and we're going to make sure that we just bring out the nice purple tone
5:53back to it same thing and then going back in with taboo again a nice dark
5:57purple plum shade
5:58I'm going to do the exact same thing with the e 43 and make sure that the
6:02bottom of the lash line
6:03does the exact same thing at the top just kind of feathering it all together
6:05making sure that's all seamless and blended easily
6:08that's only going about halfway in rather than the entire weigh-in because
6:10i want to keep all the drama and exaggeration out here on the outer
6:13corner and I bring it too far in then blend out those edges to make sure
6:17there's no harsh lines and then take a little mac , graphic pencil a memorable
6:21line of the waterline with that now carlashes and put some mascara on and
6:27once you get the eyelashes on as well
6:30this is the final I love you
6:38and by the way the lashes I'm weighing our Russian black by new bounce some
6:42really cool - because they are very dense on the outer corner and fade in
6:45and go a little bit more sparse as you're going in so it's a really nice
6:47outer corner lash which is what i was going for with this look
6:51and I put a little bit of the most lightest color from the 3500 matte
6:56palette on the inner corner it's like a matte white highlight just I just wanted
6:59to add that just give it more brightness to look and that is it for today's video
7:03i hope you guys enjoyed this
7:04I look I know I didn't do a full face in this one because I was trying to save
7:07some time and film another video right after this so i can have more videos for

1:34your
1:34hey but if you're not you're a boy like me you don't shave it either . wife
1:40first and we're going to with is the Porefessional primer you guys have seen
1:44this on my channel already
1:45I love this primer for me specifically because I have more oily combination
1:50skin and this primer is amazing for people that are more oily combination
1:53and have really porous pores which I do
1:56I'm just concentrating them most of the product in the center of the things and
2:00blending our work with my fingers
2:02I don't need too much of this product is needed towards the center because I get
2:05oil in the t-zone and have normals Barkley
2:07ours and the t-zone is not the time mom is not the time
2:12I love this primary personally if you're more on the dry side out of here gonna
2:15like it that much because I mean its memory with a more oily and have really
2:19problematic pores so if you are dry and you have nice skin they don't have big
2:22pores
2:24it's not the primer for you listings now i'm gonna go ahead and go in with the
2:28hello flawless foundation since you're going for more of a natural look I'm
2:31just going to pump up of it on the back of my head actually make that two clones
2:34can make that one
2:37make that one that's too much this color I'm using his pedal so let's hope that's
2:41Michael it's like the second two lightest what's going on with the Beauty
2:43Blender and having it on
2:45I'm gonna go and start the center of the face and blend outwards that will give
2:49us the most natural finish I feel you're just going to concentrate more of the
2:52product and the T zone where you most need coverage and then you should kind
2:55of blend out the rest of the product outwards
2:58I'll i love this foundation like this foundation because it's lightweight but
3:03it gives you a nice amount of coverage you know it's like a nice medium to full
3:05coverage
3:06I think maybe two letters too wet oh my god it's like taking off the product
3:10that I'm putting down because it's so wet
3:12bitch apply a little bit down the neck as well
3:16perfect now we are a foundation down so we're going with a number one
3:20erase paste by benefit I i love the erase paste good thing with the race
3:26paste that you need a very tiny amount of it that you need like nothing
3:29trust me like a little bit goes along with this product reviews are clients
3:32all the time
3:33that's a flora and they would actually love but you have to teach them how to
3:36use it this is one of the product because it's so thick and creamy you
3:38really need a blended out and said with the powder or it's going to be too heavy
3:41i'm using a Beauty Blender just kind of blend it out just to kind of mask my my
3:45blue circles you know that is like a nice salmon undertone to it
3:48so really helps cancel out the blue hues and i'm not going for a really dramatic
3:52highlighted look I'm just really covering up the dark circles
3:55I'm just putting in the inner corner I really just pressing it in with the
3:59Beauty Blender
4:00I think works so freaking good I counseling out like any like darkness
4:04I absolutely love this stuff but again you have to use a very sparingly if you
4:08just use a little bit
4:09blend it out if you want more a little
4:10more ok trust me trust the bitch cuz I know
4:14perfect we're looking a little more fresh now i'm going to get the hello
4:17flawless foundation powder and never settle pedal never settle pedal well I
4:22like that look mighty mite don't like a man linked on several so i'm actually
4:26grab a more feet and 500 which is like a really huge just very flimsy brush
4:32preset in to this t-zone area because i don't want a lot of power i want this
4:36look to be more in the natural site as we talked about earlier also set the
4:39under eye area
4:40this brush is great because it's only just fluffy and you know it all too much
4:43product you know deposit you want product so we're going to use the wats
4:46up
4:46basically it's a cream champagne gold highlight and we're just going to toss
4:50that on to the high plains of the cheekbones
4:53Oh Oh bitch I love that
4:59and then we're going to kind of fit in with a more PGA Tour just gonna kind of
5:02press it on very lightly to give us a nice natural glow
5:05oh my god I love this will give you this really pretty gold in champaign glow to
5:11the skin with this all I literally was alright pretty or anything let's go
5:22ahead and just coolin into our contour areas we're going to use that same 135
5:26underbrush
5:26who's the meeting especially I don't pick up too much product and I don't
5:28want to pass it too much i mean i'm not going to go for a contoured look this is
5:32much more like just kind of bronzy glow be natural and a subtle dusting and the
5:36temples
5:37this is very hard to write like this is natural for me like bitch this isn't
5:40that true it is gonna get it
5:42shit i'm just gonna dusting the rest of the powder down my neck because i want
5:46to match my neck more i don't i don't like the smell of the powder I felt it
5:51smells like black licorice maybe i'm trippin
5:54it's mostly liquid is a lot of people of the licorice that black liquor smell
5:58i'm not one of those people that's all
6:02it's all so I'm going to have a little bit of blush we're going to grab the
6:04rocket or blush which i think is stunned needing same brush to pick up too much
6:09product doesn't deposit too much product and i think that if you're more on the
6:12natural side there's like this really cool
6:14we're going to do some blush on very lightly
6:17yeah
6:18this pitch like that when I was just before my mom got this blush and she's
6:22like almost completely done with it so funny
6:24this blush i think is really great for more of a just natural everyday pretty
6:28glowing look you know
6:30yes glow coming through glow gag
6:34we're going to the brows now we're going to grab the benefit gimme brow which is
6:37in the color medium deep which I love this little bad boy it's like looking in
6:46there was some kind of pushed out through our brows are going to more of a
6:49natural look
6:50I think this is a perfect little product because you just want to do still a
6:53little bit of the bride wore nothing to crank clean is cleaned up everything
6:56looks
6:57don't you know who I love this brow gel
7:01this is like my color too but that's pretty good for just a little tiny bit
7:04of brown gel that's this late
7:06it's like an Estancia stuff like this is good now we're going to clean up the
7:09brow with the gimme brow eyebrow pencil and we're going to really just put that
7:14in the arch of my eyebrow and that just kind of clean up make everything a
7:20little more highlighted in the busy like a cream pie light pencil
7:24I'm just use my finger i'm too lazy to do anything else we need my finger to
7:26blend it out
7:27just give a nice subtle brow bone highlight this pencil might not be for
7:32someone that's like darker and complexion
7:34even I mean it's like pretty pretty white I mean blends out like a dream
7:39the shipments out bomb I love benefits stuff honestly this is so much easier
7:43than doing it like when they did the next one
7:45I hadn't tried it like any other stuff and just on that
7:49ok you want to stop sweating I got to all my fans and literally like have a
7:53moment of like silence in the fan blowing in my face because my guess is
7:59Wayne store right now I don't know what's wrong with me
8:01ok so we're going to go ahead and do primarily this is the state don't stray
8:05primer for the lid little twisty little dough for its a little cute little thing
8:10to do is just a little bit
8:12I'm very all about a very tiny amount of private facility and just letting it out
8:15because if you use too much primary it just does the complete opposite effect
8:21like that and just off center crease so easy to blend great crease color
8:29now we just have a nice little bit of definition on the outer corner
8:32does anyone on the side this is like the most natural i think i've ever been on
8:37my channel things like a feeling you
8:40and now for the part that makes the most excited for because i feel like this is
8:42what really makes it look more on the natural site for me at least this is the
8:46new benefit roller lash mascara i absolutely love this freaking mascara
8:53the way that they tell you to use this on the box until you want to use the
8:56site that has a car that's like indented and like hook it on the base of your
8:59lashes and kind of wiggle up and I supposed to use so it's going to do that
9:06another transfer yeah that's a mascara with a just a nice one little later i
9:13think that it really doesn't amazing amazing amazing amazing job of giving me
9:16more length and more fullness and that's going to apply some on the bottom as
9:19well
9:20this shit is gone for the bottom too much because that's a look at some
9:27mascara
9:28only I don't my window and started a little bit more of a background noise
9:32now but man I was sweating more than a directly not a red carpet like I was
9:36blue panties
9:38ok ok cool so this is what it looks like with some mascara on I love love the
9:45massacre I think it's freaking sickening and you guys know I wear false lashes
9:48like all the time
9:50my lashes are really like they like to point straight down so i really have to
9:53crawl on my crazy just to get any kind of curl
9:56yeah i think that they turned out pretty good for just the mascara like this is
9:58good for me the real good for me
10:00I think honestly this mascara is better than no they're real mascara i think
10:03it's so so good i love it I love it
10:09just do a little be done so we're gonna do is we're going to grab the the been a
10:14bomb in the shade

0:21believe and it feels like it has like this is really soft pink belt eat I
0:25packaging just so pretty i believe that the pans in this palette are actually
0:29larger than their previous pants on the previous palette so it is a little bit
0:32more expensive i believe the other ones were usually like 35 36 this one is 45
0:35414 shades but I really don't think that's unfair whatsoever and this is
0:40actually a permanent part of them so I'm so excited for them actually live on
0:44associate brand i think they did such a beautiful amazing products oh um
0:48this look is inspired by someone on Instagram hold on let me find it
0:53this island I going i was actually inspired by Sophia LCS makeup on
0:57instagram i leave a little photo of her right here of her look she's the same
1:00exact palette as me and I saw on Instagram on a chg we posted her and i
1:04was like dude I'm obsessed with this looks so much that was like I need to

1:39welcome to my channel and thank you for being here
1:41so it's going to get into this really beautiful soft modern renaissance I look
1:53let's go to get started on today's a video using the Modern Renaissance
1:58Palace - Oscar Beverly Hills you guys when I open this package
2:02I was so beyond excited you guys saw me on snapchat
2:06I was living I was waiting outside for hours gagging I was gasping for air
2:09i die and i came back to life it was everything so this palette is actually
2:12amazing the colors are fucking gorgeous
2:15so it isn't going in I'm taking morphine 27 and I'm gonna go in with golden ochre
2:20which is a nice just blew jariabek the the powers are really pigmented
2:27everything a mixture of golden ochre and burnt orange and i'm going to be 27 and
2:31go into my crease very lightly
2:32Anastasio shadows are so bomb and it's funny because in the beginning when we
2:37first launched I shadows they were nice like they were good but they were
2:41definitely showers but they weren't like my go-to favorite ones i don't know i
2:44just didn't like them as much as I like to other shadows but now it's even
2:47coming out with I would have been so nice so creamy so blendable and i just
2:51love them
2:52ok so now i'm going with Morsi and 43 I'm gonna mix red ochre and regular are
2:58no real car rigged real guard I don't know how to say them sorry guys
3:02realgar and red ochre and that's gonna go in my crease is paula was inspired by
3:06Renaissance paintings and I'm sure these are probably named after some paintings
3:10or some people that made the paintings who fucking knows to be honest I'm not
3:13really that well versed in that one of this match i'm not so scholarly may I
3:18went to college but i'm using my college degree now
3:21no I'm not so we're going to push that into the crease what we have the
3:24transition change will never set a little bit lower
3:27not too heavily just very lightly keeping the most people on the outer
3:30corner because that's what the photo is the outer corner of the most amount of
3:33pigment just taking morphine 43 and blend that out myself I wasn't recording
3:37the entire time so don't like so scared that that's not recording and I have a
3:41panic attack moment they're like wait why am i recording so now i'm going to
3:45go in with the shade Venetian red
3:48and this is a really cool like cranberry shade I think it's a little shimmery
3:52tool that has a little bit of shimmer to it and I'm gonna put on the outer corner
3:54with a more fiji 27
3:57this is a pencil brush I've been searching on more of his website for the
4:00e36 can't find it i think it's being discontinued so i'm trying to use other
4:03alternatives for you guys to another pencil brush like it the morphe g27 as
4:07another great alternative for the e36 because i know it's really hard to find
4:11so we're gonna put that on the outer corner just to give me that cranberry
4:16tone back to the look and bring it may be about one third of the way and barely
4:20bring it in and then just continue to blend that out as you can see it turned
4:24a little more cran
4:25I'm really digging the cream color so once you blend it out to your liking I
4:29think it looks pretty nice right now it's nice and blended my crease is
4:32looking defined in Chrissy I'm gonna take the shade
4:37cyprus number which is like a dark chocolaty Brown have one doing a very
4:41small amount of that on that same morphy pencil brush i'm gonna be doing a winged
4:45liner with this look
4:46so it's not going to be like a crazy amount just a very small amount on the
4:50outer corner just to add a little bit of definition and I'm just pushing that in
4:55with that morphe brush very very lightly because i really don't wanna take away
4:59any of that cranberry tone that we have I think it looks so nice
5:02take that and 43 and blend that out slightly awesomes we have everything
5:06blended out tonight I like how it's looking
5:09we are serving tuna on a platter realness fish four days fish four months
5:13fish for years
5:14okay with that so now i'm gonna go in a way the primavera
5:18on a more fiemme - 10 amazing packing brush you can always use the one that it
5:23comes with it because it does come with the packing brush but i like the more he
5:26was little better a little bit softer
5:28no tea no shade at all usually power brushes i'm not really the fan of ever
5:31so we're going with this pushes them to 10
5:34we're going to pack primavera all over the lid it's a nice soft like golden
5:38chain of took a beautiful golden champagne
5:42no I love and on the inner third I'm gonna take it from here which is a very
5:47light almost pinky Shane
5:49let's go into a corner as well a little bit on the lid blend it into the
5:54previously shade and then just blend between the edges with a morphine for
5:58three the same one that we've been using this because it's easier it's already
6:01there
6:01ok awesome this with the top so that I should look like now it's looking very
6:04pretty very just absolutely
6:06soft and dainty but very great gorgeous i'm gonna go ahead and do eyeliner I'm
6:10gonna take the kat von d super high liner and just do a wing with that
6:13honestly trooper my cabin day just might go to favorite eyeliner it's so easy to
6:16use
6:17you get a sharp line a very very easily it's a very black I just really really
6:20do enjoy this eyeliner going to do when we usually do it
6:24okay great so now we have the I later on it should look something like this is a
6:32very easy not too intense not to to bowl of a liner
6:36I don't know that's too bold for you but the liner however you would like to do
6:39it i just like to do I have it like this is actually really subdued liner for me
6:43so much and I think we're pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead and do the bottom of
6:46that lash line now on the photo says that all she used was love letter
6:50so I think that's where we're going we're going to take just love letter on
6:53the lower lash line
6:54I'm gonna take that same g27 and dip it into love letter which they really
6:57pretty like blemish pink actually something I might mix more than just
7:00this color but for now let's just try this
7:02I don't know who lives here so we can use that
7:08this color is stunning
7:12click crowd and you can take a little bit of the golden ochre and when the
7:17underneath this part just give me a little bit more with seamless blend and
7:21then i'm going to put the colour-pop lip liner in the shade and Lori any burgundy
7:26eyeliner will work I just can't find any burgundy liners right now remember in
7:29the underneath the lash line
7:30burgundy imac would work great too . this color would be absolutely perfect
7:37for this look okay go over to go finish that off camera okay I'll be right back
7:40ok so now this is the final product I have the lashes on my iconic by house of
7:46lashes and I thought that this would be such a pretty lash with this look
7:49because everything is really just like elongated and there's a wing it is an
7:52outer corner and i'm done with the ice so I'm going to be guided to see what
7:55they look like up close
7:57okay great so now that the eyes are done we're going to continue on with the lips
8:05now I'm gonna take a lip liner and lipstick is actually the most expensive
8:09lip come by thing I've ever done on my channel so they do it still
8:13yes I should I well something the charlotte tilbury lip cheat in the shade
8:16iconic nude and this is a nice neutral
8:19asian nude shade to the pine
8:22so this is actually more like a brown beige lip liner and I don't ever go for
8:27the cyclic ketones soho this is a little different for me
8:31and once we r lip line and we look like actually that from the fucking cell and
8:35from the value we take the YSL lipstick in the shade number 10
8:38Samantha this is Samantha always talk about the shade and i bought this in
8:42Canada but you know what if i'm gonna buy this is all color on a bite in
8:45canada won because the dollars better and two because Samantha isn't getting
8:50us so i wanted to use this shade I've actually tried it on camera yet but it's
8:53absolutely beautiful you graduate and shit yourself
8:56she said this like her perfect nude shade and I completely agree with their
8:59it's absolutely stunning
9:01such a beautiful formula consistency I it's not mad at all it's not said it's
9:07nothing more of a cream consistency is very pretty and lightweight feeling but
9:10it's very creamy and hydrating and this is the final look
9:23and that is it for the entire video hope you guys had fun watching this had so

2:07guys have tried to come at me with an arsenal you know exactly what I'm
2:09talking about the north by itself
2:11I can't do like I think it's too luminous and I don't think it last all
2:15day on me know

4:29like the fat of my chin like in this area it's an ultrasound that like kind
4:32of attacks the really really pesky fact that you have underneath your chin
4:36basically anywhere they have pesky fat kind of targets that and for me it's

5:05that's what I underneath the eyes a little bit of taking that same me 48
5:08brush and the Kat Von D shade and light using the banana sheet right here going
5:12to hit pan on because it's as a good shade that is some good shit right there
5:17I managed to kind of highlight a little bit underneath that I nothing too crazy
5:20it's not that step is done i'm gonna go and kind of cook the contour and
5:23basically what that means is i'm going to highlight underneath my contour kind
5:27of emphasize the sharp lines of a I'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent
5:30setting powder and a little beauty blender going to be the control
5:34basically wherever I wanted to come
5:35to be sharp like so and then once you wipe that away it's going to be a lot
5:38more clean and sharp and really gorgeous and very Claude toward the close and now
5:42we are nice and how did contour and contoured I mean with contoured i'm
5:45gonna go ahead and take a blush now I got this recently and I died for its the
5:49two-faced little like love flushed hearts palette like that much little
5:53heart makes when it's not so much a little harder than your blushes and I
5:56really want to use one of these and i think what i'm going to use is a mixture
6:00of love hangover and I will always love you and I'm gonna take that one anymore
6:07p53 brush just kind of dip into it and go in i'm gonna go on with all the but a
6:12goodie
6:13we're going to take the makeup ever pull sculpting duo in the shade
6:16number two which is this basically take the gold shade gonna take that shit on
6:19the same brush because this is a nice like flat angled brush and I really want
6:22kinda want to highlight with it to look at that shit for all good the shit is so
6:27I'm just kind of wipe away the cookin themselves as well as I forgot how much
6:30i love it
6:31what I live and breathe for it like so we're going to start the eyes now
6:35already went ahead and did my eyebrows off camera and I prime my eyes already a
6:38scary because I feel like that step is just so not show LA
6:41it's so unnecessary to show you guys cause you guys probably know what I do
6:45because I'm showing you guys so many times and I don't want to bore you
6:47bitches you know I really want to use a new advisor at palate today that when I
6:51hold so I'm gonna be using that today and then I have a couple other
6:54individual shades are going to use it because i really wanted to incorporate a
6:57very bronzy very glittery like had a holiday look so I thought I'm gonna be
7:00doing to day on the ice so first things first I'm gonna take beaches and cream
7:03by making keep which is one of my favorite shades from makeup geek it is
7:06the perfect transition for me for my skin tone if you're lighter than me or
7:09my complexion or a little bit darker it will definitely work for you
7:12I'm taking on a 27 ever to hit pan on it because like twice
7:15it's so so good and I'm just going to go into the crease
7:19I like a lot about the transition shade is that it's not too warm and it's not
7:22too cool
7:22it's literally like a very neutral peachy Shane or another really really
7:26popular shade by makeup geek is peach smoothie
7:29I love that one so much as well but this one it just kind of my go-to if you have
7:32been watching for a while you guys know that beaches and ha is like my shit and
7:38my titties combined court so we have that into the crease but that Marky 27
7:43you guys code more free man you at all caps and store online
7:46boom ten percent off hello that was the fastest fucking affiliate push I've ever
7:50done
7:51I'm gonna fight with Murphy just letting you guys know I'm us he was a member
7:54said oh ok now I'm going with the visor palette i'm so excited to be using this
7:57through i'm gonna take a mixture of these two shades right here it's not
8:01going anymore fee and 433 basically going back to 17 do and that's going to
8:05go into the crease the visor shadows guys are so beautiful or busy right
8:09where the fuck you wanna call it
8:10I'm just gonna kind of go in and start creating my crease with this color all
8:14the way to the front of the eye and then I wasn't getting closer and closer to
8:17being a lot lighter pressure I feel like with the bronze glory look and orange
8:21transition shade will be so beautiful that blend are you joking like that
8:25blend was seamless to have eyes on you fucking bitch and Olivia
8:29so I'm gonna take it is a very warm chocolate brown shade on that same in 43
8:33a little bit less product and that's gonna go into the crease as well we're
8:36going to add so much dimension in this look it's going to be fucking
8:39dimensional ok so I'm going to take that on the outer corner and really start
8:43pushing that into the crease
8:44I'm taking it all the way into the front of the eye as well
8:47a little bit lower than I have at the transition shade that we have down first
8:50and I'm taking and 40 and 50 cent which is a more precise pencil brush is like
8:54very pointed and precise
8:56I'm going to take this gorgeous like deep maroon shade
8:59it's not a bronzy warm tutorial without this color eye color like maroon because
9:03I'm very maroon maroon is that the color of my salt so I'm gonna go in with that
9:07one of us a little bit lower than the other shades not going to go all the way
9:11into the front again just like a deal with the other shades lower than my
9:14other transitions I swear this is going to be like the ultimate transitional
9:17thing
9:19I'm just taking a clean blending brush is a morphy 13
9:25I'm gonna just clean out those edges a little bit clean up those edges
9:28nothing looks too too harsh and then grabbing the Anasazi Beverly Hills fudge
9:33is actually part of our newest collection they just did a new fall
9:36collection on a morphine 36 a very small pencil brush that's going to go into my
9:40crease for some added dimension definition but it's going to take the
9:43darkest of the shades
9:44it's a very dark chocolatey chocolate put that in the crease and fudge is
9:49going to lowest possible into our crease right up to that very very warm
9:53transition that we got going on and I just go halfway in and I'm not going to
9:56take it all the way in like I did the chains
9:58this was just going to go halfway in and see me deepest at the outer corner as i
10:03think i'm going to be doing a winged liner with this little perfect about you
10:05have this fiery warm crease going on right now i'm going to start with the
10:09lid now I grabbed my makeup geek grandstand eyeshadow i think it's such a
10:14beautiful bronzy shade and I think it's gonna be perfect with this look like
10:18actually perfect Anton and Jaffe and for 21 which is a very nice flat packing
10:22brush it kinda reminds me of the mac one and i'm sure those are packing out onto
10:25the lid
10:26it's such a beautiful bronze shade obviously i'm gonna be putting glitter
10:29on top so it's just going to my base color right now to have underneath the
10:34glitter to give it more dimension and now for the fun part i'm going to be
10:37taking v2 faced shadow insurance clicker and mac reflex bronze and glitter and
10:41that's gonna go on top of the lid but I'm gonna take that same brush them for
10:4421 from morphe the Too Faced shadow insurance clear glue is probably my
10:48favorite glitter glue that I've ever ever ever ever tried i think it's so so
10:53good and you guys are looking for a good glue the two this one is sick and then
10:56we're going to kind of pack on some glitter glue taking some of the glitter
11:00just dipping what you can dig my hole brush in it and just pray and just go
11:04ahead and start packing on the lid
11:06I'm obsessed
11:11I love mac reflex glares because they're so finely milled they're not an intense
11:15chunky glitter they're basically like a pigment with a lot of glitter in it and
11:18that's why I love it so much she doesn't see how sickening the reflection is it's
11:21very cool very cool so let's go ahead and finish the other half the camera
11:24back and I'll be right back
11:26so the eyes look like so far also rather like just like a random side know you
11:29guys do not need advise our palate to do this i know that the power is hella
11:32expensive but you don't use this palette to be able to accomplish this but you
11:35can use like the morphe 35o it's very warm just like this you can use some
11:40makeup geek eyeshadows you can use whatever you guys have at your disposal
11:42so just don't do that you need to use the device our palate to be able to
11:45accomplish this look I just got this i wanted to use it because I love you
11:48haven't asked me to use it so this is what I came up with so far hope you guys
11:51like the eyes
11:52okay great so I went and I did my liner off of camera I just need both hands and
11:55I need a mirror to be this close to do it us know what I mean like when you do

12:06pain

12:34it doesn't have to be like fucking meter anything like that you just need to line
12:37it taking the same be 36 pencil brush
12:41we're going to start just diving into the colors that we use from the visor
12:44palette all the four up here we're going to start diving in using those colors
12:48we're going to kind of blend out this lower lash line
12:50I'm going to first go in with a really chocolaty shape right here
12:53well maybe you should like blend out the liner first fourth and final eight blend
12:57out of that perversion liner a little bit
13:00there are blending out the lower lash line

0:14hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a one brand
0:19makeup tutorial or what I do the whole face
0:21this one's gonna be next cosmetics I'm thinking about doing a new series on my
0:24channel where I'm doing full-on full-blown full-face tutorials with just
0:27one brand and I think this is the first 1 i'm starting with his next
0:30um I was very very very very very hesitant to create this video I do love
0:34a lot of nice things but I do not love a lot of mixed things as well and this is
0:38the first time trying a lot of things on myself in the tutorial and I'm not the
0:42same person like after you have noticed I'm not the type of person to talk shit
0:46about a brand or talk shit about a product on my channel a lot of people do
0:49that and it's great for a lot of people they like doing that but it's not my
0:52style I don't like talking shit about other brands and like about other
0:55products I like talking great about products and then just not mentioning
0:58products i don't like you know I mean so the fact that i haven't tried to love
1:02the next up I used in this video makes me nervous because it's like okay with
1:05us going to see if I like it or not it's gonna be right there an obvious so i
1:08hope you guys don't mind that we're if you guys can see like I don't like a
1:10product on but I don't need to talk to any brand
1:13yeah if you guys want to see that that have been going sorry it was long and
1:16show but I just I just had to say that because I'm just I'm not used to this
1:19kind of video so let me know what you guys thought if you guys like this kind
1:22of video and then of course i'll continue to do it but I was like am I
1:26going to do this because I want to talk shit but sometimes people need
1:30constructive criticism
1:32you know I'm you guys don't like the video don't fucking watch it don't if
1:38you don't like that shit
1:40yeah ok go to the store and my ok cool so let's go and get the show on the road
1:46we're going to the full face today i'm super-nervous be filming this because i
1:50don't like I don't do this kind of thing like that we'll talk about products I've
1:53never tried before on camera
1:55we're going to do is we're going to go and start with the next angel veil skin
1:58perfecting primer this one this one is one of the ones i have tried and didn't
2:05just put that much
2:07honestly I really do love like this primary like I think it's really pretty
2:11I think would be really nice base and fields next to the skin does it feel to
2:15Silicon e but it definitely feels like it has a slip to it so i think we should
2:19go on to it really nicely
2:20let's just say about it but that's a pretty good product i like that primer
2:23next we're going to the next studio photogenic foundation and she wanted to
2:27soft beige
2:28we're gonna get all of it on the back of my hand foundation is very very very
2:32liquidy like has so much like slip to it and honestly like I tried this
2:36foundation - so far i have really weird mixed feelings about this foundation
2:39because i think that it doesn't give enough coverage to have to use a lot of
2:42product it leaves you with a satin finish and I'm not into satin finishes
2:46for my foundation
2:47I like to make my foundation like Matt and then I make it more on glow in
2:50certain areas that I want to be good
2:52so now i'm going to go ahead and take mine more feet and 4 39 and we're going
2:55to really press the foundation into the skin
2:57I was gonna use a beauty blender with this but the Beauty Blender really it
2:59looks even more like this one
3:01I really want to just press the donation in because i want to keep the medium
3:05coverage this is like a medium coverage foundation and I really want to leave at
3:08least keep the medium coverage
3:09I want more but it's light and my nose is like rejecting this foundation good
3:15like my nose is not having it
3:17we have one layer of foundation on my put a lot of it on but I mean they
3:20believe her down
3:21what do you think next I'm gonna grab the NYX HD concealer in the shade light
3:27and that was going to conceal under is it like that with the concealer
3:33I tried this consider literally only one time before we'll see how my opinion out
3:37what I think about it right now on the forehead as well this is kind of weird
3:44then we go in without marking the same morphe brush and really just press it in
3:48let them see you there
3:50actually no I'm going to go ahead and take the m 4 39 my morphe which is a
3:54smaller kabuki brush and buff out the concealer
3:56I like this considered I think it's a really pretty concealer I do I really do
4:00it gives me a nice medium to full coverage it doesn't settle too terribly
4:04and comes pretty well with the concealer and makes it look like I have much more
4:07full coverage which is
4:08really like not to map not too bad computer I like you
4:12you win me over it's going to be a little bit on the islands as well just a
4:17prime for nationals later not using concealer is primary cell a very light
4:21layer of it because you want to crease is going to the opposite effect if you
4:23put way too much
4:25so we're going to put a very light amount of concealer on the lead
4:30I look like a fucking ghost
4:33so now we're going to go ahead and take the next highlight in control pro
4:37palette i haven't tried this one yet
4:39I guess we'll see what I think we're right now and we're going to use the
4:42banana shade for the under highlighting let's go ahead and load up my more free
4:46and 4 30 a brush
4:47so when i dip into the product i notice that's really powdery so a lot of
4:51product is actually tell but around the around the pan there's a lot of excess
4:55part that lifts up which is kind of annoying but I can do with that
4:58so we're going to go ahead and set
5:01the underground with this and then go and see your eyelids as well i'll have
5:08my life I don't know if I like this a lot honestly so far I'm not feeling it
5:13it's too powdery doughnuts for the bronzer so let's go ahead and take it
5:16like any kind of brush like this like a little paddle brush
5:18we're going to go ahead and dip into this color here so he said this is how I
5:21feel the pygmy is great because it's like there's a lot of pigment that comes
5:24up but it's so ridiculously it's so ridiculously pottery
5:31it's just it's such a mess ok let's go ahead and bronze look I feel like it's
5:36patchy like do not see like there's like patching is here
5:40I'm just going back in with my foundation brush and just kind of
5:42carving out the bottom of it to help with the patchiness much better it's a
5:46little more diffused now at least
5:47but you know where we're going to use everything that we can because this is a
5:50full next two are you gonna do another thing i don't like about this part is
5:55that every single color here gives a satin finish never liked truly mad which
6:00I don't like i wanted i wanted to give me more of a matte finish
6:04especially when i'm going in with more bronzy colors for my contour going to go
6:07ahead and grab this color all the way over here and that's going to be our
6:10like highlight tone color thing really pretty scene when you look at it in here
6:17it looks much more warm than this one is really pale and super like silver this
6:21one of the things that little more warmer but this one looks silver on me
6:24trying to work with that work with that
6:26and now we're going to go in with toe blush by next I hear about this blush
6:30all the freaking time that's like super amazing
6:32so bomb and it gives you a really nice pretty contours are going to try it
6:35right now I have to try to get so we'll see i'm going to use the rounded brush
6:39brush my make a geek like my normal contour brush I use i'm just going to
6:43control with that
6:45it definitely is much more of a cool tone bronzy look I'm not usually doing
6:50cool tone contours which is so finding can click so controversial like I always
6:54do like really warm contour
6:56that's a style i like to do but um you know what I i think this is cute i like
7:00this is a taupe is cute
7:02I can see why people like it for sure ok so we're contoured and ribbons we're
7:05going to go in with Nick's amber blush with him or Fiji eight now we're just
7:10going to put in turn blush area
7:12toss it on I'm sure is pretty
7:16Oh super pigmented why do i do this to myself
7:21okay you know what if we have a lot of blood on its fine we're going to go back
7:23on that foundation brush really just press over it eight plus pigmentation
7:27nyx cosmetics from the blushes
7:30holy titty in my face is coming together now it's looking better looking better
7:34for sure
7:35okay so we're done with the face basically
7:39I think we're good to go these are you gonna go into our brows first stories do
7:42our eyes
7:43I'm gonna go in with the next eyebrow gel waterproof eye brow gel and espresso
7:47and he hopes to express my last month we have tried to browse already
7:50I'm i don't really honestly my opinion on the bridge on their very intense
7:55it's hard to get a small amount and like not look dry clean it but um I think the
7:59colors really nice something like going really smoothly but I wish that they
8:02lasted longer on the brows because they don't last as long as I want to do is
8:05you want to see like a waterproof like I don't think the water looks like they
8:08definitely will come off so your brows you do not normally overturning closer
8:15yeah
8:17and then I'm going to go in with the Knicks attention brown mascara and the
8:21color black
8:22not really black and the brown take a deep brown I have tried this one yet so
8:26we'll see how this goes
8:27please be okay what is it there please be a good product
8:33mm-hmm no sweetheart uh-huh
8:37so not gonna work for me ok so the reason I don't like it because it's kind
8:41of chunky and the way implies it doesn't apply evenly on the Browse like when
8:45you're like if you have a spot on your brother that guys like a lot of hair and
8:48you're going to go over it like the skit and it will apply like a lot towards
8:52like where I have more hair so and then also what kind of moves
8:55that's why I didn't want to be removed and just it feels like wax honestly just
9:01feel like wax it doesn't feel , brow gel should feel like I have dinosaur growls
9:05in those rooms are bomb that this one
9:08don't worry i wanted to like you're really into that but I don't
9:13after trial and carbon this is what the Browns end up looking like i'm trying to
9:18get away from being like more fleet proud I am trying to more like the
9:20natural brown but products i had did not allow me to do natural
9:23I have to go fleek the parts maybe go for a week and had no joining the handle
9:28and now we're doing is we're going to go ahead and go back in with this palette I
9:32know he don't like you very much but we're going to be strong we're gonna use
9:34it so i'm using my shadow
9:36so our windows going to go out this color here which is a basically I'm
9:39cream color and that we're going to toss in to make sure everything kind of blend
9:42into everything a lot easier on a sigma e40 to highlight and contour shades like
9:46they're very pigmented but they're so hot early it just drives me insane i
9:50couldn't use them just based on the fact they're they're going with the morphine
9:55for 3 which is like my favorite movie brushes and then we're going to go ahead
9:58and go in with this shade right here
10:00the 1i used to bronze with that we're going to toss into the crease
10:03we're gonna carve out the decrease with it was like that looks pretty nice
10:09I'm really impressed with as a shadow . patches a shadow but it's catching on
10:13the face
10:14that's like I'm going then we're going with the easy for teams kind of blend
10:18I'm a firm believer in even if you'd like the shadiest shadows of the
10:21shittiest product if you have a good brush everything will turn out okay and
10:25then i'm going in with a Kentucky little flat brush and walking in with that same
10:27cream color we used just kind of highlighting the brow bone with it a
10:31nice pretty bone white color now we're actually going to go in with an
10:34eyeshadow called The Chaser fashion fascination
10:37I don't know what this is I had no idea what it's called not a single clue what
10:40that was going to go and we're going to talk about into the outer corner just
10:42for some extra dimension little bit more of a cool tone brown
10:46how many is that more like a contour Brown who like that country like it I
10:53like that kind of law
10:54I'm really impressed with how these blend on the i am not gonna lie i right
10:58and they're not hard to blend out on
10:59I am NOT faces another story another story in the face but I pretty good how
11:04about those tools that were using now we're going to go in with the girl talk
11:09I shadow the girl talk is actually part of the new prismatic shadows are
11:12launching honestly the prismatic channels are freaking bomb dude like I'm
11:16so impressed by these prismatic shadows
11:19we're going to press it on your eyelid
11:22not that we're going to use our finger press on to the lid
11:25look at that that's nice right up to the crease and then we're going to kind of
11:29go in with that and 43 just going to blend out the edges
11:32let's go into something fun we're going to go ahead and grab makes the studio
11:35liquid liner in stream below which was like this and that we're going to use
11:39our Island
11:44oh my god that was mentioned I battle is my shit
11:51we're just gonna go ahead and go underneath it and just kind of clean it
11:54up with concealer
11:55problem number one with this is that you can see right here is because it's so
11:58liquid that end up going into like a wrinkle in my eye and now it transferred
12:01upwards but for now let's just focus on the liner to get straight as possible
12:06everything would've been so perfect it just did not transfer her
12:09we're going to do is we're going to go to the concealer like it that way I'm
12:13gonna let that dry for a lot of concealer dry and then we're going to go
12:17over with some shadow later
12:18go now that we're dealing with the madness was just loaded crying it's
12:21gonna be fine
12:22it's gonna be fucking upon are you going with the next tray jolie eyeliner and
12:27brown and I think this one is really cute i feel like it's built pretty well
12:29actually in that you have a little twist top and a nice liner
12:32I think it's really pretty and I waterline these payment in like that and
12:37I buff it out
12:37nice warm brown like that you were quickly with this thing is drying fast
12:41and we're going to go in with that same bronzing claro used and then we're going
12:45to buff that over the liner because i don't want to be too dark just want to
12:50be pretty warm and if you can if everything is dry just going to go back
12:54to work on a bus in that concealer
12:58ok so that's what that looks like now that we had a couple hiccups but it's
13:01fine
13:02we dealt with it or strong bitches we can do with this shit
13:05okay well first I real quick off camera I'll be back
13:08so now we're going to apply some mascara we're going to use mix the skinny
13:13mascara which is a new product for them it's like literally like the tiny thing
13:16I've ever seen it and I think it's kind of a badass to let me help
13:19um this message is a Fed nominal Alex separating lashes
13:23I don't think it's really meant for the top to be honest but I don't have any
13:26other next month's care for the top so I'm just gonna make it work make it work
13:31with Tyra says bitch make it work
13:34so perfect for the bottom of my little bit it's a little i'm never going to put
13:39myself in the eye again cause you know I got my scare on the top and the bottom
13:42doesn't matter for the top like I'm just doing it to make it look a little more
13:44black because we're going to go in with policies
13:46anyway so don't even trip we're going to go in with falsies I haven't yet this is
13:50the
13:51mu para number one when i open this . I just I'm like can you even think we need
14:03one time I saw Scott Barnes going on his lashes like higher so I started playing
14:09on my lashes with her hair
14:13yes slashes are so good i want to slap my camera they're so good at that
14:21yeah test finally got the I look out down he finally got that I looked down
14:26so i'm going to be guys in for a final
14:28I look
14:37now that we're done with the eyes we get a move on to my favorite part which is
14:40always the lips you guys know that you're like my go-to thing I love doing
14:44lipstick i love doing

15:08live and then i'm going to go ahead and grab the next soft matte lip cream in
15:11east on board
15:13it's a nice town good no no accident that was on a business the blacks and
15:17abba
15:18I tried to Istanbul I was that is not so good like cake batter something about
15:25just such a pretty color oh my gosh
15:28they smell amazing they apply amazing but definitely not that mad like a cream
15:33that creme lipstick formula i don't really see them as being any kind of
15:36mattifying may be able to drive my lips never tried this before so see you
15:40getting mad at me now and I do you like it yeah and that was it for the final
15:44look hopefully you liked it
15:46I think this is really cool i think it's fun to kind of test out a whole entire
15:49brand to do a full face could be like resourceful you have to use a browser as
15:53eyeshadow or something that you have to be resourceful and I think it's fine i
15:56know i don't really like everything that i use but i think that the final product
15:59came out pretty nicely I think you can do is going to look for a lot less money
16:02than looks like done in the past so I think that's really really really really
16:05cool let me know if you guys really want this to be serious - I can do it with a
16:08couple more brands i think that would be so fun to do like a series like a

1:38that I'm really really really excited to go to me to Khandala see clearly in like
1:42two weeks like it's so freakin fast and random but just like this pattern some
1:46back and let's go to tell you guys I'm so excited to see this
1:50yeah okay just tutorial site hey guys ok so basically starting with our base
1:55completely done already i have like my contour on my head like going
1:59I was bronzed she's bronze and ready to go I'm i do not remember exactly what i
2:04did for the tutorial like I remember exactly close i use but basically
2:08grabbed a bunch of clothes i think i use
2:10so we're going to try to still do it wish me luck first we're going to do is
2:13going to go ahead and take beaches and cream
2:15i'm a geek which is this color here and that's gonna be our transition shade on
2:18an e 40 we're going to go and just toss that into our crease
2:21the reason I'm having it down first because i want to have a color down to
2:24be able to blend all my other colors into first but it's already primed by
2:28the way that's what I fear may be shadows of all time
2:30I still need to make a favor make a big shadow video
2:34so let me just don't want that we're going to mix bitten by makeup geek and
2:38cocoa bear by making because we're to make them together we're going to toss
2:41that into our outer corner on a more feet and 4 33 which is especially is
2:45very often it's very so much of mac 217
2:48I'm just going to us on the outer corner very likely very softly the maybe
2:51shadows are so freaking pigmented like you guys know maybe because my favorite
2:55brand of all life
2:57we're also going to toss it into our inner corner as well
3:01right into the crease so let's look at the close down in the outer and inner
3:07corner I we're going to do is we're going to make a halo that brush with no
3:10additional color
3:11I was going to very lightly etch out where a crease it is very light motion
3:16like that
3:18so you can see how this nice little ring around my eye and we're going to the
3:22center completely open cup for shimmery colors gonna go
3:24I was leaving that right here and i'll just go back in with that same be 40 x
3:28sigma and i'm just going to blend the edges
3:31this is why i was so crucial to have that beaches and cream color down first
3:34so we can have a base that the colors blend into nicely
3:37see how nicely that's running out just because we have that base down it makes
3:41such a huge difference to me now that we have that nice warm halo we look going
3:45down now i'm actually going to go ahead and grab a starter Beverly Hills beauty
3:49mark shadow which is basically a very very very deep dark plum put it right
3:53between the Barone and the inner corner so we're going to write here this is
3:59going to give us the definition in the death or it's gonna like a feather it
4:02and that we're doing that on a like a little pencil brush like that
4:05you got a little bar on jets the outer corner as well so they don't go back in
4:11with that same and for 33 and just kind of blend out the edges again
4:15no additional part i'm just letting it blend out very softly
4:22it looks something like this
4:26it's a nice dark hey Louie effect this is optional but I'm gonna just go back
4:30in with a little bit of black from making big it's called correct at a very
4:34tiny amount in the innermost corner just for that little bit of extra depth and
4:38dimension
4:39this part is optional you definitely don't need to do this but I figured what
4:42the fuck why not you know
4:44this book is very pigmented so you don't need a lot of trust me making like a
4:47little outer V now we're going to go in with a clean brush
4:52it's a morpheme 441 it's just a clean fluffy brush and that was going to kind
4:57of blend the whole thing that brushes clean so I just really wanted to have it
5:01there from blending purposes only not for depositing color and now we'll go
5:06back in with the e-40 and just blend out those edges even more with no additional
5:11product at all is well this looks so easy but I swear it's so freaking easy
5:16sorry I'm funny how easy this shit is but it looks a little bit intimidating
5:19when you first like see it but honestly you know you have the tools to get the
5:22colors
5:23you're good to go and of course i have a code with morphe brushes it's manny
5:26anyway in all caps and you get ten percent off i mean it's a little it's a
5:29little co2 little Commission code
5:31you guys don't need to use that code if you guys wanted the morphe brushes
5:33already so cost efficient or not like expensive at all so if you don't want to
5:37say no 10-percent then go right ahead and use it and in fact it's all good but
5:41it's one league has no got the option is there
5:43cool so now we're going to do is we're gonna go ahead and grab a flat brush
5:47I'm gonna use the exact blend you 32 x sigma and then I'm gonna grab makeup
5:51geek shimma shimma which is like a very shimmery champagne tone and now we're
5:56going to talk to Lynn
5:59right into the center and so what's gonna bring a lot of focus of the eye
6:02and then I'll go in with that same morphe brush that in 43 and just kind of
6:05blend out those edges a little bit with no additional product
6:10yeah yeah ok so i went ahead and grabbed an eyeliner I'm describing the one by
6:16the bomb
6:17it's the mr. right now Dean eyeliner pencil everything that they do is so
6:21cute i was going to run out of the water line as well as underneath the lash line
6:28very lightly
6:30I'm going to blend it out
6:34we're going to go ahead and grab the same bin and coke shadow on the little
6:39pencil brush and we're going to run over that black with the shadows
6:45and then we're going to blend out those even more places that pay for that I let
6:55go and finish that I real quick and I'll be right back okay cool
6:59no you're both eyes done is what they look like both eyes done real now
7:03clock me you can't I know I can't clock this bitch I'm gonna use the Too Faced
7:11better than sex mascara all day but good
7:14oh my god . click on my care of me it is the clock and I need to be a dinner at
7:20eight and i still want me to help me please
7:25oh I love this mascara forgot how much i really liked it really gives you volume
7:28and extension cable network for the bottom line we're going to use the next
7:31skinny mascara which is killing 21 and I think it's literally perfect for the
7:35bottom lashes those of you who are looking forward to booking my high again
7:40bitch think
7:42oh good so I'm going to go in with some falsies of course the falls i was
7:46wearing in that video where the believe you
7:49parent number two which give a really pretty like lifted flare especially in
7:54the center
7:54I think it's going to be great for this look because we already have a lot of
7:57focus towards the center of the lid to make it look a little bit more round and
8:00pretty
8:01seems like she's just really give you so much extension because they lift up
8:04naturally blinking view lashes honestly you guys like they are the best mean
8:08clashes I never used and I tried a lot I've been sent a lot of new clashes and
8:13blinking is definitely definitely definitely my favorite and I don't know
8:16what it is like their styles are a little bit different than other pairs
8:19their band is super super super comfortable and they just they just last
8:22a long time already used it sparingly 10 times they look as if I just barely open
8:26them but they look amazing i love them and I have a code is blinking um g10 and
8:31you say ten percent I mean it's cool if you don't use it you don't have to do
8:34anything that but it's an option there if you want to save some money on me
8:37I mean parents usually 35 bucks that mean clashes because they last a long
8:41time but these ones are 30 and then you get to save on the three bucks if you
8:45use a code so you get for 27 but I've never I've never seen in clashes sold
8:49for $27 ever ever ever ever
8:52I know the best one I've ever used so we commute
8:56you guys are so good to me honestly you guys like slay me

1:24okay who's ready for this is mario oh I've built in so long i'm fucking where
1:28you're going home where I'm going to go so much going to start this tutorial
1:33with the face already done at my base on i use the Born This Way Foundation you
1:38want they just launched by to face i am trying for the first time right now on
1:41my face nothing looks really really nice and the reason i decided to my face
1:46already is because this tutorial is more on the like intricate side like this
1:49more steps to doing this look then it looks but i'm going to go ahead and just
1:54have my face are you done
1:55don't give me no lip so let's go and start this Beach
1:58ok cool so first things first I'm going to start in with peaches and cream and
2:02Peach Smoothie by makeup geek I'm going to mix those on my brush because i kind
2:06of want to be a little more warm than usual and i'm having a little bit of
2:09peach smoothie because i usually go to my beaches and communities no beaches
2:11and cream isn't my favorite transition shade of all time but I wanted to be
2:15slightly more warm than usual so that's why I'm having the Peach Smoothie into
2:19it
2:19oh and i'm already primed on the lids and my browser kind of filled in with
2:23some brow gel so forget it was wondering like this it's really going in with
2:28nothing no
2:29I'm already primed with this e27 this is like my favorite i'm blending brush
2:33right now it's a very similar similar to the e 40 x sigma and Matthew 24 just a
2:37really great fluffy blending brush which looks something like this it's just easy
2:41transition very very low-key can invade be honest i'm going to take a more feet
2:47and 4 33 which is very similar due to the mac 217 and i'm going to mix cocoa
2:50bear i'm a geek with secretive my morphe i just discovered the shadow recently
2:55I've actually using the tutorial but it looks so effing pretty I had literally
2:59like a to use it sometimes it on the outer corner and i'm mixing the two
3:03Colbert and secretive secret is a very very very warm deep maroon color it's so
3:08nice it's so freakin nice
3:10I've never even like going any of the morphe single shadows i got them when I
3:13was a famous bow so I was like Hello what the hell I'm doing not only getting
3:17the single shot with Murphy
3:18okay so I'm gonna go and take that and for 33 and those two colors and put it
3:22into my crease a little bit lower than I thought the transition colors right up
3:25into the inner corner because this is more of a smoky eye
3:27i'm having my eyes open for this so i can see exactly where the shadow will be
3:31when my eyes are open the secret of shadow you're making a lot of bitten but
3:34it is more red than Britain's not have to travel down there just place down
3:38there's no blending going on that you 27 really just blend out the shadows in to
3:43the transitions that we had down first
3:46this is gonna really help keep everything a lot more blended and a lot
3:49more diffuse this is why i have the shadows down first and it's going
3:52circular motions without you 27
3:54I love this blending brush to death you are using extremely extremely warm tones
4:00so that you're gonna have to continue to blend blend blend and just when you
4:03think that you're done blending blending a little bit more than you're good
4:05it's where it should look something like this nice and blended out very warm
4:09cranberry Brown i get your noises my converse you're fucking-a now I'm gonna
4:15go in with that same for 3 with a white a little bit off on my pants and I'm
4:20gonna go in without especially health beauty mark shadow is one my favorite
4:23rappers of all time
4:24it's a beautiful warm plummeting a plum brown it's so fucking pretty I use it
4:29all the time you guys don't use the whole time I'm going to concentrate on
4:32the outer corner because this is going to be more of a smoky look and there's
4:35kind of blending it forward into the crease ok now that you have this bad boy
4:39blend it out nice little
4:40warm intense crease going on right now pretty smoky we're going to grab the
4:44two-faced glitter glue it looks like this i saw Jacqueline using this and so
4:49obviously i was like what Jackson illusion that and we're gonna put that
4:54all over the lid i'm going to go ahead and use any synthetic brush i'm gonna
4:57use the more feet 320 i'm in love with the whole lid all the way up to the
5:01crease and then now for the star of the show that everyone was asking me to talk
5:05about it is boom boom shadow by Mac that's a dazzle shadow is one of the
5:08newest shades it's one of the most beautiful shots never even come across
5:12ever and I'm going to cut my finger
5:14I'm gonna put that onto the lid and press it on my god i love using this
5:19with a glitter glue down first because it really makes the shadow pop
5:24underneath it as well as it's going to stay there all freakin day just many
5:28ways to an event and that bitch stayed on now to take that and 43 and just come
5:32and go in to the crease with a slightly blend out any hard lines usually when
5:37using glitter glue and glitter like there will be hard lines just a little
5:41baby amount of blending bull really hope this is what the top of the list look
5:45like i'm gonna go ahead and finish the other I off-camera when we come back
5:49we'll do the bottom of the eyes and we'll be doing ok ok ok so i have both
5:53of the eyes done on the top even don't even if it doesn't huggles you like the
6:00life but like the cuter version called goggles
6:02ok ok since the tops of eyes are done it's going to focus on the bottom now
6:06we're going to go and take peach smoothie on my morphe be 36 my favorite
6:10pencil brush of all time you guys already know by now that it's like my
6:14obsession a bitch can't stop a bitch canceled for reals i'm gonna take my
6:18secretive and colbert mix again on the same brush and then put that starting on
6:23the outer corner and then i'm going to work it forward work a good link down
6:28and then we're going to take my morphe and 50 k which is a really tiny be
6:32lining brush and take that beauty mark shadow again and put that clothes to the
6:37lashline can really speak when I do this to really help darken the outer corner
6:41gonna take the next train shall lead black liner and take a little gel liner

0:37so I figured you know whether to a prom look let's make it probably because i
0:40feel like this is a very pretty appropriate kind of prom

1:32watching this shadow to you for texting me that we have the same exact i looked
1:36on and also same side let's get to the tutorial this problem beautiful problem
1:41by you guys will talk to you soon
1:43let's go ahead and start this bad boy with a clean face I just showered wash
1:47my face and my stride
1:48so she's clean for now I said we're gonna go ahead and go in with the make
1:53up for ever step 1
1:55equalizers I've been loving these bitches lately so we're going to do that
2:00would actually go in with 2 i'm going to use the base mattifying for the t-zone
2:04the reason I'm using for the t-zone specifically and not like everyone faces
2:06because this bitch when it says mattifying my hi guys i mean funny like
2:11this thing dry my skin areas that I needed to be dry like it was disgusting
2:17the crazy so I'm just going to put it in the t-zone and the areas i usually get
2:20oily
2:21ok I swear like as soon as they put it on me even now by moisture like it's not
2:26that I'm gonna go in with a step one base smoothing all over the rest of my
2:30face
2:31this because I do want to have primer on throughout the rest of my face and this
2:33one is really great for kind of texture and things like that so for foundation
2:37or what I'm going to go in with the estee lauder double wear this is like my
2:40tried-and-true foundation this one drives with that finishes stays on my
2:43face all day getting a full coverage
2:45I love this foundation I've changed 1w to sand and i'm going to use it with a
2:49damp beauty blender with five people were here last night
2:51huge now we're going with our time to dinner and its really press the
2:55foundation in all over the face
2:58there we go nice and full coverage to help me your full color child
3:02i'm going to go ahead and grab the mac pro longwear concealer and nw20 in order
3:06to put that on the under eye areas as well as a brand new who do you like my
3:10which commandment and i love this concealer
3:13it's beautiful bowl not only is it going to highlight me it's going to really
3:16help cover the darkness I have underneath my eye is not that I have a
3:19shade time I'm not much you don't like darkness but she does have some song
3:24I'm gonna use that beauty blender to really help blend it out more i look
3:27like a little girl
3:28that's fine and all come together to get off and now we're going to go in with
3:33the Smashbox comparing things but i did my haul video I a lot of people were
3:37like oh my god you have to use the contour sticks in that video so i was
3:39like your model thing i'm going to do it for anyone use the highlighting one for
3:43the under eye area
3:44the shooting thing about the highlight one is that I feel like it isn't having
3:46me enough
3:47I just don't feel like that's a lot of highly you know but you know it's still
3:50beautiful and still highlights
3:51it doesn't have as much as I wish it didn't but that on the forehead is about
3:54t-zone and then we're gonna put that out the be better as well at the end
3:57these conferences are sol blendable it's not even funny knee
4:02oh my gosh they are still vulnerable makes me sick ok now we're going to go
4:05in with the bronze color stick
4:07the reason I'm putting a base down first because you know we're going to probably
4:10want to stay on as long as you possibly can at least I do I know I do
4:14and so I think have
4:15the base down first will really help the longevity of which i'm gonna take the
4:19Beauty Blender and buff that and like they're blending out phone easily and
4:24it's making me and it felt good
4:26tell me that it's not gorgeous okay cause this is what it looks like with
4:31just the bronze stick on i think i look super pretty much time to look at more
4:34bronze and kind of glowing in getting us to mention when I look like such a ghost
4:38and now we're going to go in with the contour stick and this one we're going
4:41to be a little bit more precise with a stick and we're going to do right by the
4:44top of the ear and that's all we're gonna do is we're going to blend it out
4:47i don't want to be too hard with this one because ones as much more of a great
4:50toe into it and the bronze g one does the lighter with this one I think the
4:53better and i'm going to go ahead and use my g3 from morphe to really just gonna
4:56help blend that in i'm going to go with that beauty blender just kind of press
5:01over it just to give us a little diffusion got off the views to the same
5:05thing for him
5:06I'm going to take the laura mercier he's setting powder okay seriously
5:09this powder and a double life it really fucking is do it's so good and get me a
5:15map throughout the day
5:16i'm making a beautiful like airbrush finish i just love it so we're just
5:19going to go in really just pressing on the power over our faces underneath that
5:23I - can I don't forget that because he will create the creasing monster
5:28and don't forget your lids to because we did use the concealer as our base and
5:32now we describe a big fluffy brush just dust away and the actual card that might
5:37be there
5:37I'm going to finish are faced with the Kat Von D shade and light palette
5:42because i love this bad boy
5:44so much going to grab the highlight middle shade right here on a more fee
5:48and 438 like my kinda late rush of life and it's gonna really just press that in
5:53on top of the highlighted areas where we put the Smashbox contour stick the
5:58t-zone as well and then go for shits and giggles let's go ahead and put in mac
6:03emphasize highlighting sculpting powder just a little bit just to brighten it
6:07even more
6:08we really don't need to step but you know i'm a big ass directly not hard
6:12dimension hey I feel like I have to be quiet because people are like in my
6:15house like those like workers and shit and I'm like I'm not gonna be quiet
6:19I don't care where he continued with the shade light power we're gonna grab
6:21subconscious with the makeup geek rounded brush brush I use this brush all
6:25the time for contouring I just feel like it's perfect its precise it's easy
6:28towards the back of our ear and just use that as our contouring shade and just
6:32kind of buff it in
6:33we're not doing anything too precise this is just really going to ensure that
6:36we have it on a lot longer . the night or I mean we're going to probably going
6:39to say it's like I'm not about to be on down on the dance floor and my contours
6:42melting off like be her last time

8:16while I can definitely do a brow routine video if you guys are interested in that
8:19but I'm just gonna do it off camera clicks I felt just going to be some time
8:21to be right back
8:23cool so we have the browse on I don't know why I've been feeling like I want
8:26to go more fleek lately I just feel like a strong i just feel like doing strong
8:30browse right now I don't know what it is
8:32I just do it because i do this and using bitches to fuck me when I do this you
8:39know we get to let our eyes so I'm gonna try my very best to recreate this look I
8:45do not remember exactly every single that used by grab colors i think i'm
8:49pretty sure i used so this is what I have had so please wish me luck on this
8:54i know you guys do because you guys want it
8:56I think I go ahead and zoom you guys in because I really want you guys to really
8:59focus on the eyes because this sighs look is a little bit more
9:02it's not hard to do but there's some steps there's a couple steps to it so I
9:06figure it'd be a lot easier for me to see you guys in
9:08first we're gonna go ahead and start with peaches and cream by making you
9:11guys know what my favorite transition shade of all time and I'm gonna take
9:14that on a Sigma e-40 blending brush and we're just toss that into the crease is
9:18our tradition so you don't need me to meet with it
9:20I just got a new signal 40 so I'm just like new and then I'm going to go ahead
9:24and actually take a sigma e55 which is a flat shader brush my morphe brushes are
9:30dirty you guys I'm sorry forgive me but they're all talking right now
9:33I mean I'm taking the Anasazi bling eyeshadow and i'm going to put that on
9:36my brow bone as my highlight already have like some concealer down there that
9:39I used to clean up my brow so we're just gonna really help set that ish in motion
9:45what am I saying
9:46idea and then we're gonna actually go in with Poppy by a good because well I were
9:50to take a very small amount of it and now we're going to talk into the crease
9:52with that same here 40
9:54this is really gonna give us that warm you should have something like this it's
9:56nice warm transition shade
9:59we're gonna go in with mocha on a morphine and 43 and clean this point in
10:03time
10:03mocha by makeup geek and now we're going to kind of focus on the outer corner
10:07press into the outer corner to the crease a little bit
10:11we're really going to run into the crease about half way things are I am
10:14going with the e 40 and just blend that way
10:16it's really crucial to go in with the steps and just continue to blend with an
10:19e 40 or any kind of big fluffy brush
10:22I think it's really really really important that's what I'm doing kind of
10:25blend in transition now i'm going to go in with that same and 43 with make a
10:29geek corrupt so very tiny amount of it because it's very people to donate a lot
10:32and never to that concentrate on the outer corner and slightly bringing it up
10:36words into that papi
10:38not nearly as far as muckle though the same thing going without me 40 and blend
10:42out the black triangle with an e30 pencil brush by Sigma because i really
10:45want to really concentrate the Blackland like a CEO job like you can pay to blame
10:52there we go now we're going with the fun part of the lid color going to go in
10:56with a flat dense packing brush I'm going to use the sigma f 70 which is a
11:01dense packing brush I'm going with make a deep grand span and eyeshadow
11:05this color is literally life like actually literally life or really just
11:11pressing that on right up to the transition shades in my crease that shit
11:16real bright so actually I'm gonna go on my finger and take grandstand I finger
11:19and press that onto the lid
11:21I really wanted to be shine even more shiny the shadows are really great with
11:25your fingers because they give you this nice foil intensity like that then I
11:31want to take a more fee
11:33326 and in the spotlight I make a geek
11:36now we're going to place on our inner corner as our highlight this shit
11:39highlights that motherfucker
11:40and so is what the top of the looks like they look so pretty oh my god
11:45yes other probably yeah
11:48Corner I'm gonna take mocha and mix it in with peaches and cream and we're
11:53going to take a more feet and 5 08 very tiny amazing brush getting underneath
11:57the lash line and they went on that a little bit and then we're going to grab
12:02mr. right now Dean pencil by the bomb which I've used before my channel
12:08I just really like it they're just going to blend out whatever is left underneath

0:10so great and it looks good on absolutely everyone and so I really wanted to show

0:14I love you more likely to make up a height of my personal favorites video
0:16with what the deep plum red lip and say hey I wanted to go with this goes a
0:21little like live like you know that's what I can always do a tutorial using
0:25that lip as well he's going to see but this is that I look ahead in it and i
0:28wanted to show you guys how I did it because so many people requested me to
0:31do it so this is the look and so without further ado let's go into YouTube
0:35tutorial become i feel and i think my interests are so fucking long and I just
0:40want to get guys to that
0:50so let's start the shenanigans
0:54let us please so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna start off with some
0:57tape
0:57to be honest I'm not the biggest fan of using tape and makeup in general there's
1:01only two things that you before i use it for smoked outliner like this and i use
1:05it for glitter and we're getting the piece nothing too crazy and they're
1:09going to cut it in half so one piece goes on each eye and the reason I'm
1:12putting in habits so that I don't get so much like my foundation like ripped off
1:16because I foundation already
1:18usually you want to do this makeup before you make a point but I'm stupid
1:22that's what i'm doing is i'm sticking the two pieces that take on the back of
1:26my hand
1:27so we can take off the first layer of like stickiness
1:30it doesn't rip off our I when you're placing the tape
1:33what you want to do we're gonna grab the tape with both hands are going to line
1:36it right underneath
1:37be very careful with this please go right underneath the lashes at the
1:42corner of my eye you see that right there
1:44the reason we're going underneath our lashes because because we don't rip off
1:47our actual election
1:48please so now you have this nice straight line from the bottom lash line
1:54going all the way to your brow game which will stick that there and the part
1:58honestly this part does not not to be stuck
2:00this part is not to be stuck the part that really matters is this part right
2:03here this really needs to be against the skin so you can have that sharp crisp
2:06wine
2:07ok so first things first we're going to go in with our transition shape just how
2:10we go in with transitions were doing normal i look we're going with the
2:13transition for this as well for me i'm going to be going into it make a geek
2:17peaches and Kareem of gonna go with my green room and the luck see Beauty 207
2:22brush which came in the genes makeup brush collection which is really is
2:27beautiful Gina did a great job with her brush collection i think they're
2:29absolutely amazing
2:30we're going to do is literally you're going to go with the beaches color and
2:33is already primed by the way shit is print gonna go in and we're going to
2:37really just feather that forward into the eye from our crease all the way in
2:42to about halfway through our eye on the lid to have the whole I want you want to
2:46have covered with the transition all the way out to the tape this brush is
2:48perfect because it's so fluffy it's not to attend it actually it's an angled
2:53brush on you can tell but its angle - it's really great diffusing from the top
2:56and much more dense towards the base
2:58boom to have a transition color down first and then we're going to transition
3:02again we're going to be using a massage early Hills color and fun
3:053 i'm using this color fun is because I wanted to be a very neutral look I don't
3:09want to be too what I don't want to be too cool
3:11and now we're gonna grab 10 more feet and 4 33 which is I've talked about this
3:14many times
3:15one of my favorite brushes and then we're going to take just a little bit
3:17lower
3:19closing are again taking on the lower - all shadows are so amazing so soft soap
3:26into it and this one we're going to just take about half way down the eye and
3:30into the crease as well and outwards and we're just putting on that a little bit
3:35lower than that beaches color and then i'll just go back in with that original
3:39Russian you want it that looks brush just kind of blend everything together
3:43i'm a freak about transitions I need them to be completely completely
3:47effortless I do not like seeing any hard lines at all it's one of the biggest
3:51piece so I really like having some very diffused easy transition to apply a
3:55little bit more fun
3:56towards the base like that
3:59so she looks something like this so when you're looking down the most pigment on
4:04the outer corner and it transitions outwards from here about two huge can
4:08see that feeding into lightness
4:10now we're going to go in with making be corrupt shadow which is probably the
4:12black as I have ever ever ever use its five dollars like are you kidding
4:17it's so amazing and we're also going to go in with a pencil brush from you
4:20because well it's actually one of the best brushes for tight lining and for
4:24detailed work that I've ever used and make a history ever so we're going with
4:28that which is a little bit of brush you don't need a lot correct because the
4:31corruption was extremely extremely extremely pigmented so just pick up a
4:35little on the brush and now we're going to go even lower than fun
4:38now we're going to run by our lashes about half way and pick up a little bit
4:44more product if you need somewhere and that we're going to run along the tape
4:48about where natural crease is about it go
4:51so we're going to go up to right there
4:53going to kind of bring it down here as well we want to be extremely extremely
4:57black by the lash line
4:58so really just packing it on my last night and the lighter pressure going
5:02upward nothing that blacked out i'm going to go in with another clean
5:05blending brush I don't want to have any other product on it and with the makeup
5:08geek Bible underbrush which looks like this it's a little angled brush and now
5:12we're really going to just bust in that black with the into the fun
5:15you don't need me - this just blend your little heart away because you have to
5:20take their kind of foolproof this way
5:22now we're just kind of taking it out words it's just one of those looks at
5:25its kind of laborious because you have a kind of a lot of steps to do this but
5:28honestly like the finished product is so worth it
5:30look see how fast that was blended out like this is why it's so extremely
5:34crucial to have those transition colors down first because it makes everything
5:37so much faster and everything much more smooth and so now we have let it out i'm
5:41going to go back in with a little bit more correct
5:42we really really really really want to be dark as possible
5:46look something like this so you can see some eyeliner is very diffused and very
5:51blended i just noticed that i took it farther than i wanted to take it the
5:54black I wanted to go about halfway not really necessarily like three fourths of
5:58the way so i'm actually gonna fix that a little bit so what I decided to do is I
6:01decided to grab a big shading kind of brush and I grabbed my mistake
6:06color so for example if I want to kind of a race a shadow or kind of diffuse it
6:09out even more
6:10I would color that night like to call it like my race color and for me it's
6:13vanilla bean
6:14I make a gate when I mean by race I basically means i'm gonna load up this
6:18vanilla bean color I'm going to pack it onto the lid very lightly and blend it
6:24outwards in to the shadows and as you can see right there
6:28it's trying to diffuse out even more and that's kind of what I wanted to happen
6:31I didn't want my black to be so far in so i'll grab this vanilla bean and i'll
6:35take it and run it over the black to give it a nice lighter diffused look see
6:40that now gently not gone it's not a race like home saying but it's definitely a
6:45lot less pigmented a lot less intense and then I'm just gonna go back in
6:49without black not just vanilla bean on my brow bone as well isn't this nice
6:53bone white shadow it's not too intense
6:55it's a little slight slight slight sheen to it it's nothing too heavy at all
6:59and those are my kind of happened
7:00cuz i'm not really the biggest fan of those intense brown highlights a lot of
7:04people are they love them at the bottom is not one of those people
7:07so now that we have everything diffuse and blend it I'm gonna take off the team
7:09carefully to get me this wing out shadow liner and the cool thing about liner
7:17like this is that if you are like me and you have like a hood here that wants to
7:21fall on your lid wasn't going to transfer at all because it's a shadow
7:24it's not an actual liner so you get a nice definition on the outer corner of
7:27the eye but it's not gonna transfer you
7:30and this is why I don't like doing that tape methods because it removes my
7:33foundation and concealer
7:35so what we can do to fix that grab any concealer brush like the consumer brush
7:39that you used earlier like today and I'll grab it and I'm just gonna run it
7:42over that spot with the tape to kind of just diffuse out fact that there was a
7:47hard line there
7:48this will just help me really buff it out this is the morphe m35 one of my
7:53favorite concealer brushes of all time I talked about this in my December
7:57favorites video it's absolutely amazing and it's a while do is just kind of buff
8:01out the line and look see
8:02not nearly as intense and that's crazy as it was before ok so I'm going to go
8:05outside real quick and i will be right back my little darling
8:09ok so now we have the tops of both sides done
8:13they look like this honestly they're not completely 100000% symmetrical but it
8:19honestly does not matter that much to really to be honest like as long as you
8:22get it symmetrical as you possibly can
8:24no one can fault you for trying this is even as I'm gonna get for right now
8:28yeah so just don't don't fret if you guys don't get it completely even for
8:31the first time it's one of those things that just takes a learning curve
8:33especially be doing it for the first time so don't give up on it because I
8:36need you guys to do it you fucking give up on me
8:39take care so now we're doing the bottom lash line
8:44we're not going to do really much the bottom much like that off when I do a
8:46liner like this I like to keep my bottom lash line is clean and clear as possible
8:51ok Richard's gonna come here to me they are going to grab that same making Gibby
8:55brush and whatever we have left on this brush we're just gonna run it on the
8:59lower lash line barely like barely fucking just the outer corner only do a
9:07little somethin somethin right there
9:08not too much though I'll take that about a thirty percent in how meaning that
9:12they're just gonna blend that I really just don't want anything too hard shell
9:17here and i'll just buff it out with whatever we have left on that more of
9:21you brush the m4 33
9:23look something like this it's not too intense on the outer corner but you have
9:26a little bit of definition and I want to keep the definition solely on the outer
9:29corners that's we really just want to keep it on the outer side right now
9:33ok so it's gonna put a quick coat of mascara on this is the Too Faced better
9:36than sex better the thing sign the thing
9:42my lashes are so ugly inside of money
9:46put a little on the bottom to carefully
9:50who's texting me you know what that's enough
9:54I'm consider myself lucky right now with them out i have on so much
10:00so now we're going to go in with lashes we're going to go in with the blinking
10:02you
10:03number four which are these because we're really focusing all the attention
10:07on the outer corner

1:17I'm going with the new foundation today I'm gonna be taking it the cogiendo high
1:20definition and makeup foundation
1:22I've never tried the foundation it's kind of awkward foundation in the shade
1:25one two three
1:26shit I have thank you so much how to coach you know for sending this to me
1:29they sent me this foundation and they sent me this color
1:32soho let's hope and pray that it's the right color
1:36I'm going to take it out on a morphine for 39 of course whenever having more
1:39voluminous aqua foundation i like to go into more of a dense brush because it
1:43won't soak up as much product as a Beauty Blender will
1:46nice color matching skills guys nice color managing the color is actually
1:50very accurate my face it just lighter than what i like to do you guys know mom
1:54wants to beat earnest but this is a beautiful finish like beautiful and it's
1:59very building was you can see it does build up very very nicely it's not as
2:02full coverage they want but i'm going to wait for full coverage of today like
2:05more of a natural look so I like it I want to go pretty lightweight with the
2:09consumer will be taking the urban decay naked skin concealer gorgeous concealer
2:13i love this one
2:14it's full coverage it's lightweight honestly I don't really have any qualms
2:19with this concealer and I never have so I really went for a really nice fresh
2:22look today
2:23not super crazy not to pretend super drag like I like to do you usually just
2:27a little more brightness I'm gonna have this the dandelion shy beam by then if
2:31it just a little bit just to add some more brightness
2:34I'm just going to put that in just the right in and awake in the look
2:38oh go ahead and set the concealer and taking the laura mercier translucent and
2:41just lightly going over be concealed and brightened areas just going to want to
2:45increase its happening
2:47my interface we're gonna take the naked skin Urban Decay ultra definitions
2:52powder every time they say that that is do much for me and soon as likely set
2:56the entire face with this
2:58this is a nice HD powder it's not as heavy as laura mercier one but it is a
3:01beautiful setting powder to set the face and it is an HD finish so it's going to
3:05be you too full and it's not going to be too heavy
3:08it's gonna be just enough taking some mac studio fix powder and take that neck
3:12just to match up the face a little bit
3:14you guys don't want to be two tone I mean I like to leave the dual chrome to
3:17the shadows . to the face
3:19come on let's match up here ok now taking some trustee hoola bronzer you
3:23guys already know I went through this phase right now where it's like only
3:27hoola bronzer and markets bronzer I like I'm not use any other brothers besides
3:31those because I just fell in love with
3:33I'm just gonna brought up the temples a little bit who is such a pretty color
3:37it's like such a natural bronzer
3:39it really does look like your likes uncased rather than being so like orange
3:42or gray
3:43it's just like such a good neutral color I love this problem where I always have
3:47not fucking spot on my face that doesn't take pic map
3:50I tried like blow a bubble to make it get in there and it just doesn't work
3:55doesn't fucking work
3:57let's do a bit of no snatching it's real quick i'm going to take the morphe 28
4:01and the makeup geek
4:03cool porcelain contour powder and we start contouring the nose slightly just
4:08to give me a nice skin to know to put on too much more rounds around the nose and
4:13now it looks like i just snorted shit to concentrate for the nose contouring you
4:18can go south so quick
4:19we're going to cook the roast to make it look decent because i feel i'm looking a
4:23little cracky okay to kill our mercier translucent setting powder on a more
4:27feet and 45 heat cook the side of the nose to make it look sharper going to
4:31let that rest for a moment and just cook into the nose and i'm still on the
4:35bottom of the browser as well just a very tiny amount because i don't want to
4:39be to confer today I'm going to more of a natural i mean naturally you're going
4:42to get for me i'm going to go into my e49 brush my morphe just a little taper
4:46little cute with brush and I'm going to the local - hacia the back locate
4:51because i was studying my tip into bubbly and sunburst these two sides with
4:56like two top ones right here and dip into both of
4:58those start highlighting the bug
5:04do the bloke it's like ridiculous that locates are so fucking yeah this is why
5:12they are my favorites we have my back a while Tony 453 blend between the bronzer
5:18and highlighter
5:20Becca wild honey and mac warm soul top two blushes of literally all time and I
5:26like this one because it's more about burnt apricot color and which is great
5:29for more of a bronzy look it's not super like blushy it's a very just pretty
5:33bronzy natural blush color going to brush away the little nose contouring
5:38the funny thing about nose contouring sometimes you can beat the bitch fucking
5:41into the ground chisel her down to nothing to a toothpick and sometimes you
5:45have bad days and today is not my day
5:48okay so it's not right there with the nose we're gonna move on or you move on
5:51to the eyes the faces done I call it looks I think looks very pretty bronzy
5:55glowing and now it's a lot to the case
5:57so basically just fuck my life I finished filming the entire I look
6:02thinking it was on camera of course
6:04see if I care of course and turns out I didn't feel any of it those the off the
6:09entire time
6:10mhm mhm so how to wipe off
6:14one is I could show you guys what to do huh
6:18so let's go to start this one work back in time
6:22I'm gonna take the mac pro longwear concealer going to prime my lids with
6:26this concealer actually learn this trick from Jaclyn hill and the olden days when
6:30I watched your old videos should actually use a pro longwear concealer
6:32all the time as a primer on her eyes and I started you can get a maximum like I'm
6:37trying to wait like what John is talking about when i was working out and it
6:40worked really really well so I'm like you know what to do that again around
6:43mayo and so again right now so sure - Jacqueline again
6:46I came back at it again with the fucking tips and tricks this look is so freaking
6:50easy guys so like I'm not even that mad I didn't do it on camera back and we
6:54created very very easily
6:56I'm gonna be taking my man anyway and makeup geek palette today
7:00look at this little bastard is only fucking good I feel toward the fuck up
7:04because my mom was abused do
7:06i'm using this part today because I told you guys also try to incorporate this
7:09part as much as I can and tutorials for those of you guys who did get it and
7:12those you guys will want to get it
7:14you guys can definitely
7:15create so many different looks with this palette which is why I want to do as
7:18many as I possibly can
7:19that makes sense we're gonna go in with beaches and cream nice just be easy
7:22transition color
7:24absolutely love this color so much
7:27we'll get that into the lid with the morphe 27 rush next we're gonna take a
7:30scrap paper which is a nice beautiful maple brown tone on a morphine for 33
7:34that's gonna go on the outer corner of our I very much
7:38only on the outer corner and the powder third of the eye as well
7:42it's just gonna kind of trick the eye to give us more uplifted look on the outer
7:45corner when we do shadows out here
7:47that's what we're doing I'm just running out here not going too far in and
7:51breathing out with the e 27 just to make sure there's no harsh lines and edges
7:54you guys this looks so simple but that's kind of what I wanted it to be I want to
7:59be a nice pretty simple everyday look that you can do in your fucking sleep
8:04basically so next thing is we're going to go in with the morphe 32 and Artemis
8:07shadow
8:08it's a really pretty yellow champagne shade that's going to go all over the
8:12lid as are really pretty bright intense lip color
8:15luckily because it does have that nice golden undertone it's gonna look so nice
8:18on so many different tones even if you're darker complexion
8:21it will look a beautiful shimmering highlight color then taking that same
8:25and 43 with no additional product blending out the edges of Artemis just
8:29make sure there's no harsh lines and that is it for the top of the is super
8:33easy super simple just a pretty natural glow EULA been taking a more 4036 brush
8:38and mixing it with peaches and cream and Sora
8:41that's gonna be ran underneath the lower lash line just give me a little bit of
8:45definition on the lower lash line I don't like it when it's completely bare
8:48I just think I look really weird when I don't put a little bit of something down
8:50there I don't know I'm just like really weird about that
8:52are any of you guys worried about that like you guys have to push out those on
8:55the lower lash line or not just mean because I really I do
8:59I don't know why I just do and then we're going to take a little bit more of
9:02artemis and that's going to go on the brow bone to make sure we have a nice
9:06glowy effect like i was saying earlier and on the inner corner of quarters
9:09already technically curl the left at the end of mascara on them so they look
9:12fucking wonky as hell
9:14sorry about it because i had a wipe off the makeup I did that benefit roller
9:17lash on the top and I did not extend my google backlash on the bottom and also
9:22one more thing I forgot to do on this either already done this I i took the
9:25new aqua xli pencil by Makeup Forever
9:28they did a club with charli XCX dancer named and i'm going to take the yellow
9:32shade i'm gonna put that on the lower lash line on the lower waterline
9:36yellow is a brightening color it's a very very illuminating and awakening
9:39color so I'm very intrigued by doing a yellow pencil on the waterline I kind of
9:43like it
9:43so that's it for that I look I really think it's absolutely stunning you guys
9:47to keep it at this and be good to go
9:49but it's not a man you a tutorial without some lashes so I'm gonna put on
9:53a pair of lashes really quickly and i'll be right and once you put on a pair of
9:57serengeti lashes by a new bounce some this is what the look should look like
10:01I absolutely love these lashes let me go into any guys in to see what I look like
10:04up close
10:14great so now that we have the face completely done and eyes are already
10:16done as well i'm going to go ahead and do with the lips
10:19now i'm gonna do is just nice very pretty and natural it i'm gonna take the
10:22next peak of the neutral lip liner I think it's definitely time for me to get

0:07everything that's fall inspired so I want to do another fall look but today I
0:12want to be a little different and do some color I haven't done anything like
0:15colorful colorful wise in a while so I thought why not incorporate green
0:19all I like smokey eye it's still incorporating color but it's still so
0:22fall appropriate and so beautiful and I think that this look turned out really
0:25really nicely for games like if you see any kind of like cracking in my face my
0:29eyes and my nose got really really really really running throughout this
0:32video because i want my allergies are starting to act up really badly and so I
0:36just couldn't stop anything like all my offices were just leaking
0:41I just sounds so fucking gross I look like kind of like a disaster right now I
0:44apologize i try to get through the tutorial as quick as I possibly could so

1:03this full face tutorial
1:08okay great so we're going to start this tutorial actually had no makeup on
1:11whatsoever i don't have moisturizer and I want to do a full face kind of thing I
1:14don't want to just kind of be like basic and just do that is even though I so the
1:17main point of this video I want to do kind of like a get ready with me style
1:21so yeah we're just going to go ahead and start doing the whole entire face let's
1:23start this bitch
1:24let's get started we're going to take the mineral primer veil by our class
1:29I haven't actually used on camera before but I used it a couple times actually
1:32like this primary uses when a couple times that's really nice oily skin feels
1:36really really nice expensive as hell though
1:38oh my god it's so expensive it doesn't give me like that silicone feeling and
1:40it doesn't fill in my pores like I wish that they were fills in
1:44but mama has big course so I like to cover that shit but that does not happen
1:47with these primer for foundation for taking the l oreal prom at infallible
1:51which is my father gave baby i'm gonna shade one of three natural buff
1:55I'm running out of this being severely and that was gonna put that on the
1:58t-zone with the Beauty Blender and damp Beauty Blender percent of the t-zone
2:01this foundation is just so good at it from the drugstore for cheap it was so
2:05good i put it mainly in the t-zone that that's right the most oily and this is
2:09more of a mattifying oil controlling foundation t-zone covered in the
2:12formation and everything else is left bare for the rest of this I'm gonna be
2:15going in with the makeup ever
2:17Ultra HD stick i use in my makeup forever tutorial will show you how to
2:20cover up the rest of my face mostly on the cheeks with the stick this is like a
2:23full coverage foundation that gives you more of a natural finish
2:26I'm gonna put that on the parameters of my face the reason I'm avoiding the
2:29t-zone is because this does not help prevent my oil whatsoever i gets the
2:33oily as hell want to use this mix and match people mix and match for whatever
2:37you need and years to perfect
2:40now my base is based on an extra concealer we're going to conceal these
2:43fucking bags back too bad they're not Chanel because I'm gonna take the
2:47Maybelline master class in the shade light
2:51I'm gonna take that underneath my highest is gonna go right from the tube
2:54I love this concealer
2:56i'm also going to have it with it as well it's just so good it's like full
3:01coverage
3:01super brightening but you need to say extremely fast like you can't like
3:04weight to set it because it will kind of get crazy and I'm gonna mix that with
3:07the map
3:08Prime in light boost just give me some more brightness underneath the eye
3:12you know - like to be highlighted to death and the beauty butter it out again
3:17and then taking my trusty bareminerals all arrested powder on am or PM 438

3:28rested add that is a huge difference in connection to look at this brightness
3:32and happiness and awakeness and look at that luggage it sleepy now for the
3:36highlight I'm gonna go in with just like a creepy way before I go in with powder
3:39ones later

3:42champagne highlighter i just got this recently and I haven't tried it yet so
3:45I'm just gonna try it and I'm gonna use my ring finger and just kind of press
3:48that over usual highlights go
3:51it's a very pretty glowy Rosie champagne tone that's right natural this like by
3:56itself is very natural thing just gives you more like a glow from within
3:58actually really quite stunning wow very beautiful breast milk powder my face

5:32phone work and login good i think i want to do like a snapchat Q&A
5:36I think a lot of people have been doing like snapchat q and A's and like they've
5:39been going around for like a while now and people are doing them but i don't
5:42know if people want to look at people want to see that do you want to see
5:44snapchat Q&A to the Q&A like couple weeks ago that's the problem
5:47maybe I can do one like in a couple months are like a couple weeks when I my
5:51other Q&A is not so fresh
5:53I don't know what you guys think ok so this is the thing a lot of people always
5:55ask me like many why cant i send you any steps
5:58the reason you became semi snap is going to have its such a private to like
6:01people are only friends with can send me snaps and the reason is because i get a
6:04lot of snap views ok so when you get a lot of snap views and you have your snap
6:09set to public your snapchat will usually freeze because you're getting a lot of
6:13snapchats you know
6:14so that's kind of what the reason why I hey I haven't been able to really put it
6:18on the public because of my snapchat will freeze and I can't snap chat look
6:22it's not trying to like figure their shit out if you only does not sound
6:25promising in bronze and Rome how this video's not too long I just like I'm
6:28talking I'm very talkative today I just want to like talk to you guys more so
6:31forgetting to home
6:33forgive me i'm going with some blush i'm gonna take my morphe three brush and
6:36video blush by urban decay and never tried any of their blushes
6:40I just got someone recently and I really wanted to try it out that's pretty good
6:42so nice like it's like a flush color to the rose pink rose pink there we go on
6:45like what the fuck are you
6:46ok so now i'm going to shade and light palette by Kat Von D I'm gonna take my
6:50favorite like contouring brush now of all time then make a geek chisel cheek
6:54brush basically this brush and take the shape this brush has really rebound by
6:59contouring who is calling me
7:01the reason why i love this brush the bristles are extremely soft and the
7:04length of them is perfect it's a it is the perfect brush basically okay so you
7:08guys know like about the heater brush than ours eat it's a really extremely
7:11popular brush that is used for like bronzing and contouring right
7:15I have the heater brush and I really don't like it talked about my channel
7:17before like that i don't like the nausea , see when i first tried i was expecting
7:20something like life-changing
7:22I thought was gonna be amazing and i only got it cannot wait to try this out
7:25hated it
7:25like I litigated and also what the fuck why do I hate this brush you know
7:28finally realized that the bristles were just not the kind of bristle I like I
7:31don't like tough bristles like that it was a really tough
7:34for me to use so whenever you see this brush this is exactly everything I
7:37wanted from the EDA like that's why i like this so much i feel like this brush
7:40has like really rebound to my contouring game because it's just so ridiculously
7:45soft
7:46it's so good honestly I don't even know what to say about it like without
7:48looking like a cheese ball but it's seriously amazing because almost done
7:52now i'm going to highlight for reals like on top of my house later I'm so
7:54excited to finally be able to use this on camera because they're actually out
7:56now I felt so bad using before this is the Anasazi is so Hollywood highlighter
8:00i've been using these highlights of the past couple months and i am obsessed
8:03I'm gonna take my morphine and 510 brush and just get right into it and start
8:08highlighting with it i'm obsessed
8:11maybe I was a little too much
8:14oh my god I was like why is looking so crazy right now but i just realized i
8:17have cream highlighter underneath its type on a little bit of that out
8:21perfect so we have the base of the face completely blew me just a little bit
8:24nose contouring I've been really into nose contouring lately I don't know why
8:27it's just been like something I've been wanting to do but i've been using this
8:29little makeup geek brush I'm using this low shade over here
8:33dusting off a very little better when he's a very small amount of it and just
8:35been kind of contouring my nose with this brush is very very very lightly
8:41like nothing too crazy because I don't like to do a heavy nose contour I feel
8:43like it could mean you look real like fucked up real quick
8:46but this brush is pretty freaking perfect for a nose contour kit it's so
8:50thin but like the bristles are so nice like they're just so good
8:53boom with that snatch knows do you think that was like 30 seconds or so now that
8:58we're done with the face we're going to do the eyes now and let's go ahead and
9:01get ready for that
9:03I so I done in July balls
9:06so we can focus on the boys so we can finish the ice I don't know how I don't
9:09know why I suddenly going to accent sometimes I just do i'm really weird i
9:13love accents for some reason I just really - already filled in my brows off
9:17of camera and i already put on my primer by using Smashbox 24-hour as always it's
9:22the best one I've ever used for oily lids if you have greasy late it's the
9:25best primer I'm not getting started going to some shades now this is my
9:29color I'm going to work with
9:30I want to do like something like different something more colorful than
9:32usual so wish me luck because i feel like i do neutrals very well but I don't
9:36do color super super well all the time for she was I don't ever work with like
9:39green and
9:40take a mixture of beaches and cream hand this beautiful warm orange shade that
9:49shall not be named
9:51I'm gonna put that in the crease with a morphy 27 brush just go into the crease
9:55it is such a gorgeous like warm transition I want it to be really warm
9:59in the crease I think that's really great when you're doing like colorful
10:01things on the lid like I love to do a nice warm transition shade just kind of
10:05tie everything together that makes sense that see this nice beautiful warm a warm
10:09crease so now i'm going to go in with dirty martini by makeup geek and i'm
10:13going with that on a morphine and 43 and it's just a really nice olive green
10:18shade it's very very pretty i'm gonna be putting that on the outer corner and
10:21into the crease lower than we have that nice warm transition shade
10:26I'm taking out all the way into the front of the I just nice light motions
10:30flipping the brush upwards to put it into the warm crease perfect so now I'm
10:34just going with a black base i'm gonna be using the morphe gel liner in slate
10:37it is a really nice just black eyeliner but i'm gonna use it as my base today I
10:41want to go to more of a smoky look I've decided so we take a little bit on a
10:44morphine ether t2 packing brush and I'm going to run that on the lid close to
10:48the lash line
10:49it's so black and so creamy it's the oh it's so good all the way up to that
10:54dirty martini color as soon as i'm getting higher and higher i'm using
10:57lighter pressure and blending downwards so i can have a nice little blend
11:03we have a nice black bass down looks look alive uh-huh
11:06I'm gonna grab a mixture of high tea and dirty martini on this just sigma e30 two
11:11brushes like a nice just packing brush I'm going to pack that on the entire lid
11:15to give me a nice green olive green base I'm using the black bass down first cuz
11:19i like the way that a black base gives you dimension for this kind of color it
11:23just it makes it look so beautiful
11:25I'm taking that right up to the dirty martini color just concentrate on
11:28packing on the color which is something like this it's nice green all of shade
11:32and
11:33we're going to take that for three again and then mix dirty martini and high tea
11:37on the brush and just go into that crease and just blend away in to the
11:40warm orange shade that we have going on
11:44I was like so nervous to do this - I'm like fucking all of green smokey eye
11:49with a little i think i am I think I'll go back in without a nice warm shade
11:52with peaches and cream mix just kind of go over the edge is still slightly I
11:56still wanted to be really warm and I want to try to lose any of that warmth
11:59in the crease because i don't like it to be too cool tone or two green
12:03I guess you could say i want to have some nice depth and dimension and he
12:07doesn't like this so far
12:08Yeah Yeahs perfect together both of the tops of the thighs done it's nice and
12:11blended I think it looks really really nice and I feel like it looks very
12:15festive it's very different for me i don't really ever do like green or blue
12:18or things like that but i really want to start venturing out into the world and i
12:21think it looks really beautiful especially with that like nice
12:23orangi warm transition and like a nice dark lid i love it I love it I love it I
12:27love it we're going to be taking the tart inner rim liner is just like a
12:30black eyeliner and I'm going to line the waterline
12:33this is where this is like one of the creepiest liners I've ever freaking
12:36trying it is so creamy and then tight line as well so it's going to take a
12:40little bit of the black along the lash line
12:42make sure you call your lashes to with the eyeliner if you want any like a
12:45little like missing like skin spots you know I know it looks really Jenky as
12:48hell but that's okay because we're gonna pick set
12:51so now i'm taking morphine and 508 i use as much all the time i was going to
12:54smudge out the top liner is very very creamy so buns up really easily and now
12:59course we need to be going over it with green again I'm gonna take a mixture
13:04again a dirty martini and high tea
13:07i'm using my 36 and blend that over the black I want to be exactly the same as
13:11it is on the top and this will take a little bit of time just to cover all the
13:14black
13:16and then take that nice orange shade again and then go ahead and blend out
13:19that dirty martini adjust some nice warm to give it more dimension not make it
13:24look so harsh and start you know to me
13:28ok so basically i had to like turn off the camera because my eyes were going
13:31crazy like i might already started acting really bad no sorry running
13:34really bad in my eyes are watering so right now i have a spot in my high that
13:38it will not take liner so I'm just gonna skip past I mean I've been waiting for
13:41like 10 minutes to like let it like subside so i can put eyeliner there but
13:44it just will not take whatsoever it's too watery
13:47so I'm just gonna have to deal with it for now I'm just shit happens I went
13:50ahead and applied mascara off Karen just cuz I didn't know like what the fuck
13:53expect this I so i did that on camera
13:56I'm going to play some lashes because its eyes is much more smoking intense
13:59i'm going to be using my bella lashes from new band from these lashes kill me
14:04they just make everything so much better than what it was originally basically i
14:08tried to do this last step but I'm gonna take shimma shimma as my highlight on am
14:12or PM 3267 put on inner corner of my eyes
14:15it's really brighten it up I whatever being really Ted smoky eye
14:18I want to go really heavy with the highly on the inner corner and the eyes
14:22just like you like it really it really brings it look together a little bit on
14:26the brow bone as well just a smidgen
14:28and now the eyes are officially complete i'm going to begin to see what they look
14:33like

2:40want to start getting into it
2:41just jump right in and film with every thinks I'm not a lot of you guys do tell
2:45me that guys like to see more full face videos rather than just let me do my
2:48eyes are like one particular things so I'm just listening to you guys more than
2:52doing what you guys asked me i am your fucking slave
2:55first things first I'm going private with you make it four ever step one step
3:00one skin equalizer base in smoothing literally you can see that I've had some
3:05lovin
3:05Pat it on my nose and on the center of my face and it really does conceal the
3:10appearance of my pores and when i'm going to make up all day
3:12it just like looks nice it looks really really nice and it helps with my oil a
3:17little bit as well because it is a smoothing silicon e primary great for
3:21the center of the face i'm not going with the lorry ella no Matt and fallible
3:24you guys know that one of my favorite foundations
3:26honestly it's just such a good foundation and yes to the drugstore and
3:2828 bucks
3:29I'm gonna put that on the t-zone with the burner awesome romance novel is in
3:33the center and then for the rest of the face i'm going to go in with the do your
3:36air flash foundation my favorite foundation of all time this is literally
3:39number one foundation for me
3:41you really can't go wrong I swear to such a beautiful foundation i'm going to
3:44use the shape 300 for my face
3:46it is not my shade I do know that it does a little bit darker but no fucks
3:50given
3:51I'm just gonna bounce that in with the view under usually I'll take this
3:54foundation on a like flat top kabuki brush or something like that but I just
3:57been using it with the Beauty Blender recently and I noticed that my skin has
4:01been looking so fucking be like so nice with a Beauty Blender when im using it
4:05just I don't know I feel like I'm really working the foundation into my skin like
4:09really just pressing it in working it in and I've noticed that it really does
4:12make a difference when im using it with a blender rather than aim laptop the
4:16bookie
4:17but I'm either way both work great awesome stuff we can see that I'm gonna
4:20be going in with two colors from the naked wait list can see their line from
4:23urban decay
4:24I'm gonna be taking the shades light neutral and shades fair neutral and i
4:28just--literally i just love these considers soul much
4:31it's just beautiful like full coverage consistency it's like light weight to it
4:35is that the weirdest thing I don't know how to explain the consistency of this
4:37can see that but it's just so nice
4:39so first I'm going with the darker one closest to my eyes because it has more
4:42pink undertone so take the lighter one and put that
4:45lower than the other concealer and it's going to start blending out with the
4:49Beauty Blender know that we already used before so I think it's been I feel like
4:52I've been gone for so fucking long which I really have been i've been gone for
4:55three weeks
4:563 21 days I've been gone that's so long i'm filming in 21 days what I really
5:02have filled with Jeffrey present rolls-royce video which was so fun to do
5:07he's gonna be doing a new series on his channel called like a rolls-royce get
5:10ready and I think it's a freaking genius idea
5:13so that was really fun by having feelings like at home or for my own
5:17channel and literally like three weeks the funny thing too is I still have like
5:20two videos i have three films that have you put up yet so I'm going to bring
5:23those up very very soon
5:24I just like to really film when i get right back home because I feel like I
5:27forgot how to film so i need to get into it you know
5:29so I'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent setting powder and this be
5:3248 brush and just set the under eye and for the rest of this i'm going to take
5:36the ultra definition of loose powder by urban decay on b.e.t morphe brush and
5:40just set that all over the damn face just to set everything make sure nothing
5:45is going to be moving around
5:46I think it's absolutely beautiful it gives you like HD finish and when you're
5:51going for you too honey
5:52HD is what mama lon ok and I'd like to concentrate on the edges of my face and
5:56then I kind of bring it in because this is a shade of a little darker than me
5:59already went with the darker and make sure that i need to go to the dark about
6:02or do I don't think it
6:04do not neglect the neck because you already know
6:07just don't do it I really don't like to take liquids and very often
6:10liquid foundation like to take powders on my neck to match everything because
6:13if you like it so much faster and easier and I don't know the locals are just so
6:16weird eleniak don't like it I'll do it sometimes but not too often
6:21let's go ahead and highlight the under is really quickly with the market since

8:39how do you guys use this tell me you guys have the sleek solstice palette it
8:44is one of the most intensely highlighting bright highlighting how
8:47they never use every jacket was the first 1i think to talk about this on her
8:51snapchat and she said was like the one of the most being highly she's ever ever
8:54tried and I'm sure tons of people without a body right after her and I was
8:58one of them
8:59I literally saw that and I was like oh um I need it
9:04I'm taking this little kid right here this is a highlight that's like really
9:09really brighten really intense so if you're the average person that doesn't
9:11like a bright and intense highlight work
9:14you can literally stuck in cause accidents
9:17I am the LA so I think Jackson really started a trend here with this
9:22bright-ass highlight and let's all think of right now I think Jacqueline hope for
9:27this highly because i don't think i've ever had highlighted this bright in my
9:30entire life

9:41brow routine let me know in the comments box below and I'll definitely get that
9:43done for you guys but I've been liking this more full heavy route

9:56killer palette and I have it today to try out for you guys
9:59that's the packaging come on now
10:04oh ok cool just slay my fucking all existence why don't you
10:10I'm going to take my morphe 27 and I'm very very very light layer of Courtney
10:14which is a nice just like pretty neutral brown crease shade and that's gonna go
10:18into the crease very lightly this in your transition machine
10:22I'm not to put a lot of it at all though - I system
10:24shade because i don't want it to be too intense but i do want to have something
10:27that people blend into because I'm an idea of what I want to do today and it
10:30involves the pink
10:31so we can take a little bit of this color there we go very very just soft
10:35nice easy transition and then I'm going with more p.m. for 33 and I'm gonna take
10:41this shade star power which is like a bright ass ping shan that's gonna go
10:45into the crease I feel like I want to do like a nice pink crease white lid blue
10:50under I just very very Barbie kind of look and I know a lot of people looking
10:53at this kind of thing in my , couple shades are really really bold but why
10:56not use those shades that people are gonna be like steering away from into
11:00this video so I'm gonna go ahead and put star power into the crease it's a nice
11:05hot pink
11:06look at that pigment though wow ok the first time using it you guys like this
11:09is like we're using this together
11:11taking it all the way into the inner corner and now we have this is really
11:14hot pink crease
11:16I don't know everything looks so cool I just blend it out a little bit with a 27
11:20again this pink is like more than neon bright pink did everyone make sure the
11:23edges are clean so that might take the shade vanity on a morphine 18 inches are
11:27packing up on the outer corner
11:28just give me a little bit of definition it's like a purple color very small
11:32amount of it because I don't want it to be a main focus of this look just a
11:35little bit of the outer corner it's a nice like deep blemish great almost with
11:39a pink I'm gonna blend that out something like this now it's nice dark
11:43outer corner amazing finale of the darkness on the outer corners looking
11:46like this very nice and just edgy and having some more dimension I'm gonna be
11:50taking favorite brush at the moment more p.m. - 10 i talked about this already in
11:53my last favorite video such a good packing brush and not the shade china
11:57white which could actually be like my favorite shade in this entire pallet
12:01it's so so so nice it's like a nice just creamy white color
12:05so pigmented and i love this Shane's online and 43 just blend out those edges
12:13a little bit
12:13I just looks very like barbie glam so I want to do eyeliner I'm gonna do
12:17black eyeliner and take the kat von d tattoo trooper liner and i'm going to do
12:21a wing just feel that bad boy in
12:25great we have the eyeliner on it now and as you can see just adds a really cool
12:29extra cat-like definition that makes it much more wearable to like the pink in
12:32the crease I know it's kind of scary to some people but it makes it much more
12:35when you do a nice eyeliner look like this so i wanted to add a nice bold
12:39freaking eyeliner just a fucking cut about that they try you
12:42it's not like that so not going to be taking a more 1536 and the shade
12:47expensive and that's gonna go on the bottom lash line if it's a blue shade
12:51with nice like satin finish like a little small like sparkles of like
12:54silver sword on the bottom lash line and really Barbie this bitch
12:58oh you know I mean I feel like a little awkward princess
13:01I really don't want to get Kourtney just to blend out the blue and I just helped
13:04with the appearance of a blend so it looks dark hearts you know I mean I
13:10found this island my color pop that looks so cute a periwinkle color in the
13:13shape
13:14france and i think this is what I do in the water line and I know it's not the
13:17same exact color anything but it's just the same color family
13:21it's along those lines blue paint
13:24periwinkle we're going to do it okay
13:29you guys want to do something so bold going to use a freaking cream liner a
13:33black liner doesn't really matter

13:38more fee and three to six and the same championship don't put that in the inner
13:42corner just give me my life back to the high because everything is pretty mad

1:14going ok great so we're going to start this video i already have my base on
1:18like I'm a foundation my contour highlight
1:20I just feel like this look is all about that I Sarge wanted to quickly rushed
1:24through the face
1:25I did not melt lipstick swatches if you want a lot of you guys would like to do
1:28a look with the Dark Matter stack or any of the stacks melt because they're
1:31really good stacks and they have a great shadows I told you guys about them
1:34so for this look I'm going to be using the Dark Matters back from melt
1:38sooo i think so
1:41then we're going to live in the first we're gonna start off with the shadow
1:44blur which is basically like a nice little PG just neutral beige color it's
1:49very similar to like peach smoothie and beaches and cream by makeup geek which
1:53is like that nice transition if you don't have the shadows totally fine just
1:56kind of find the equivalent you guys do have I'm gonna go and take a t27 morphe
2:00brush and other newly brushes you guys know the brushes off my finger morphe
2:04brushes that they came out with their so good i'm going to add that into my
2:07crease my lids already primed and my brows already filled in just a heads or
2:12because you got to thinking what the fuck are you doing no I'm ready and
2:15ready primed so I'm gonna run that into the crease it's such a pretty transition
2:19color i absolutely love it
2:21so nice just chill baby i'm going to you guys in a little bit closer exactly like
2:25you can't really see but now i'm going to mix unseen and enigmatic these two
2:28colors are here
2:29nice like neutral brown with a nice really warm cranberry red that come on
2:33red tone mixed with like a brown neutral Brown is like my favorite and they're
2:36just kind of thinking on your feet and 4 33 you guys know it's my favorite movie
2:40brush basically ever and I'm going to put on the outer corner
2:42I'm going to run it on the outer corner don't need me to meet with it but you do
2:46want to place in like a certain spot because this is going to be like a halo
2:48I don't bring it too far in
2:50just keep on the outer third of your eye right up into the crease and then do the
2:53same thing on the front of the I like the front third part as well start on
2:57the lid and bring it up into the crease it should look something like this just
3:00by placing the color down and now i'm going to go and make that halo effect
3:03I'm not picking up any more product i'm just literally lightly blending from the
3:06first third of the third with no additional product i'm just literally
3:11using whatever i have left on the brush and blending across to make this nice
3:14halo effect in keeping the center of the eye completely bearing then I'm going to
3:18grab that same a 27 by Morsi and blend out the edges of the shadows blend so
3:24freakishly nicely i was like shocked when first using I was like no no and
3:30then go ahead and bring it out slightly over here on the harder third
3:33it's nice to have something like this is like a nice warm cranberry brown tone -
3:37it's so pretty it's nice and blended want to like this look is so simple that
3:42you guys are gonna be like oh my god the fucking thing I'm really having alright
3:46so now we have the base of our halo I kind of done we're going to shade dark
3:51matter which is the black in this little quad
3:53I'm gonna take a very small amount of it because it is extremely pigmented is
3:57such a good black name or Fiji 36 which is my favorite pencil browsable damn tom
4:02you know that we have a code monkey man you will get you ten percent off
4:05I'm just like I'm gonna fill it with more you guys know a lot of you guys
4:07know this little you guys don't if you're new to my channel
4:10not only is my favorite brush brand of all time but honestly my favorite
4:13affiliates to be part of because they're just good people you know more fees such
4:16a good brand and they have such good quality and I'm just really proud to be
4:19familiar with them you know
4:20so we're not gonna take that black I'm gonna take it on the front right before
4:23the inner corner
4:24I'm just going to feather that forward maybe 36 and the same on the outer
4:27corner i'm gonna put it on the corner
4:29feather it forward and then take that and for three again and blend out that
4:33black into the previous colors just to make the transition a lot more seamless
4:37just one more easy just doing circular motions inside
4:40that's why i will give you a nice really pretty gradient this is all i need to do
4:43for the help are like the halo I part is done
4:46the middle of my is completely open and that's what I'm gonna be putting the
4:48glitter or whatever we're going to be using much of a planner you want to
4:52remember to keep blending through each step you know what I mean you wanted to
4:55be a very seamless easy transition so it's kind of a point of this whole thing
4:59but I use a two-faced glitter glue to go ahead and put that all over the middle
5:03part of the lid
5:04the only thing that should be about this glitter glue is that it will take off
5:06the product underneath your eye
5:08it's kind of sticky so you have to be cautious of that like shadow underneath
5:12this it will take off the shadow and then the star of the show which a lot of
5:16people have been asking me about this glitter
5:18it's the body sparkles silver by England's like one of the most gorgeous
5:23glitters I've ever tried to take a 3d glitter from Maxine's similar to that
5:27and then I'm going to take a more feet
5:29320 and this is just a really great precision packing brush and that's what
5:33you really want to do you want to go to be flying everywhere you know what i
5:35mean so that's going to use i'm just going to go into the glitter dust off
5:38the excess and start pressing in the center of my not going too far up just
5:44where you put the glitter glue out and you want to just put it on the mobile
5:48lid you don't want it to be too far up because it's going to transfer your eyes
5:51are open so she looks something like this
5:53if you notice that the glitter is like not blend it a little bit stark then you
5:57can go and go back in with the same blending brush and just kind of go over
6:00the glitter slightly without like messing with it
6:03- too much i'm gonna say it's hard to blend glitter obviously he's gonna want
6:07to be cautious and like blend around it make it look a little more seamless if
6:10that's what you want
6:11I'm going to finish this thing off camera real quick and I'll be right back
6:14perfect now both of the eyes are done this is what it looks like I'm obsessed
6:18with this google it
6:20this critter is everything so now i'm going to go ahead to the bottom of the
6:24eye on this side I'm going to take that nigga
6:27unseen one more time on my same you 36 I wiped away the Dark Matter color from it
6:32because it was like obviously black want to run that underneath the eye on the
6:35outer corner and then on the inner corner as well now I keep a little small
6:39baby space in the middle just empty
6:41I'm going to take the same glitter glue it was underneath there a little baby
6:45well that face though only a mother could love
6:49just for shits and giggles you don't want to do this at all i'm taking boom
6:52boom room by Mac you guys know this is like one of my favorite - I was that
6:56they were released and told us to buy it
6:57this is another way to incorporate it i'm gonna put that right underneath to
7:00give me that really cool intense sheen on the bottom two
7:03that's so fucking bad ass dude might take a little bit baby amount of dark
7:10matter the black to add a little bit more dimension
7:19yeah
7:20it should look something like this for the waterline i'm going to the England
7:24kohl pencil number five which is basically a nude liner
7:27don't put that in the water line like this look is so grungy so like yeah this
7:32is not like a normal everyday look but fuck it
7:37I already curled my lashes and apply mascara on so i'm going to take the new
7:40bounce on the faction lash this is a collaboration with one of my friends and
7:44his name's Alex faction on youtube he is a fellow youtuber and he's like a
7:48special effects body painting kind of youtuber and he did a collaboration with
7:51new bounce some which has no Bella means from the balance of my favorite lashes

8:23of latch it's actually really great that you don't need to
8:25I like lashes that are a little more full of more 3d that's just my personal
8:28preference but these are really nice lashes for those of you who like that
8:31natural lash look you know and this is what it looks like with the lashes on
8:36I'm going to you guys in to see what the final looks like up close and personal
8:47perfect the eyes are done and we are running so long
8:52ok so now i'm going to do some blush because i have my contour and highlight
8:54on not like highlight but like I did on door I'm going to take mac blush and
8:59warm salt an oldie but goodie on my morphe 3 i'm really hoping the the leads

9:08so I'm just going to run that on the apples of my cheeks blend into my
9:12contour
9:13I love this blush warm soul is one of my top blushes of like life

9:40dramatic
9:41I want to keep the lips really neutral gonna take next people neutral lip liner
9:44and why my life
9:45oh I'm lined and I'm going to go and take serenity and put that on my lips
9:50it's honestly just the perfect like warm brownish pink and put that on my list
10:01and I'm going to let that dry and I'm gonna go to a nude lipstick on top just
10:04to really like tie it all together
10:06honestly you could leave it like this is perfect it's such a neutral color it's
10:10not going to interfere with the violence whatsoever but I'm gonna go and make it
10:12a little bit lighter because I wanted to be like almost like a blocked out late
10:15but not too blocked out i'm going to take YSL number one it's like my
10:19favorite one is a lipstick and I'm gonna get that all over the lips it's a very
10:22light baby pink and the reason i have started he as my base is going to give

2:26make tutorials with this palette has forget possible without getting annoying
2:30so this is the first one and i am so excited to show you guys
2:33so let's get into it great so first things first we're going to be taking
2:37beaches and cream and a mixture of Sora on e 27 brush and that's just going to
2:42make our own custom transition shade i love doing this especially with these
2:45two colors sore is a very beautiful burnt orange shade and beaches and cream
2:48is a very pretty neutral like transition chain putting those into my crease with
2:5527 brush not just going to go all the way and as you can see it's depositing
2:58such a nice amount of color
3:00I love doing this with any 27 because i feel like the 27 brush my morphe is so
3:04fluffy and it deposits a really really nice range of color rather than just
3:08putting too much on or too little on you're going to see just how easy this
3:11look at you guys are gonna be like yes bitch
3:15as you can see it is a nice orangi transition with the crease
3:19nothing to him the clothes are extremely pigmented so you don't you put a lot of
3:22product on it and it's really a Bob
3:24ok taking a more free and for 33
3:27this is really nice do for the mac 217 or Sigma e25 I'm gonna go in with frappe
3:34which is a permanent shade by making me twitch a beautiful like maple brown
3:37color and I think this shade in the crease is so stunning
3:41I'm just going to pack it onto the outer corner just to give such a nice
3:44definition and really pretty warm to the look at to go all the way in which is
3:49very light hand with that you don't want to go too heavy
3:52it's very lightly go all the way in
3:54and then take that you 27 one more time just going to blend out of those edges
3:58you guys make a geek shadows because I've ever tried to keep shadows you know
4:01that the blendabilities Nicki shadows are literally so good
4:07it's insane up on the are you have something like this nice we just warm
4:11crease and the fuck is next pitch what the heck of it
4:15we're gonna go in with Aphrodite which is a beautiful plumage brown shade it's
4:20stunning is a very deep color on a morphy e36 pencil brush
4:24I just want to keep the color very concentrated where I wanted to be
4:26something using a pencil brush you can use any brush you want to use it for me
4:29a pencil brush works really great with this kind of look I'm just on the outer
4:32corner and drag it up into my crease with the product i have left on the
4:38brush
4:43and i'm looking at about one third of the way into my high and taking it for
4:47three one more time I'm going to blend out that Aphrodite shade into the
4:50previous two shades just make the blend a lot more seamless I really wanted to
4:54be a very seamless easy blend this look is really definitely my everyday look
4:57because I just think it's absolutely perfection
5:00not to be a bitch and not to be biased but I think it's perfection
5:04you should have something like this now that we're rocking that crease hardcore
5:08taking a little bit of fix plus i'm going to spray my morphine for 21 which
5:12is not very flat packing brush just a little bit of X plus on it because I
5:15feel like for a foil shadow and makes it look like a lot more intense and like
5:19oil you know to me it's just gonna do on this brush and then I take the shade at
5:22luna which is a beautiful to be pink color
5:25it's a very intense shine color i'm gonna go ahead and put that on the lid
5:29know i'm doing a mixture of both
5:31packing and wiping emotions that's kind of how i like to do the foil shadows by
5:36makeup geek and make sure when you're using a foil shadow using the correct
5:39primary for your i am really really oily lids you want to use a primer that's
5:42good for oily lids like me
5:44I use the Smashbox 24 hour one or the map won the 24 hour Mac one whatever
5:49it's called is really really good too because they are very hardcore and
5:52silicon and they're going to help keep the oil of your legs at bay which is
5:55what i need for foil shadow if you have tried using foil child before an
6:00increased on you try using a primer that is very good for oily lids I'm just
6:04going all the way up to front pay like this and then to get a 40 one more time
6:09we're going to blend out those edges very very lightly though I really don't
6:13mind it being kind of harsh because I think it kind of looks cool but I'm
6:17going to keep the edges a little bit on the softer side
6:20my first stop of the iso then I'm going to take the shade arguments with a very
6:23pretty golden like a pale gold champagne shade on am3 26 by morphine is a very
6:30small detail brush it's great for the problem grief in her corner so I want to
6:33do on the highlight of the problem with this shade very very very lightly though
6:39because this is a very very intensely reflecting shade as you can see it's
6:43like button on the inner corner as well
6:46same brush such a pretty according to see a shit
6:50do you see that shit o Lord O my lord jesus
6:53okay so I'm gonna go and finish the other eye on top of it
6:56off of camera and then I'll be right back hey guys i went ahead and i did my
7:00mascara eye lashes and liner off camera
7:03I went ahead and just do that i really want to just kind of focus on the
7:05shadows because that is what this tutorial is because I see me do I wonder
7:08so many so many times
7:09really want to keep it focused on the shadows
7:13ok and i want you guys to like inspiration with the shadows you've been
7:16doing with this looks or not you can do lashes with this look or not it doesn't
7:19matter
7:20imagine the bottom lash line now so I want you guys to that part just in case
7:22you guys are carriages so much like i'm going to go ahead and take sora on a 18
7:28pencil brush my morphe this is a really really great pencil brush with a very
7:31fluffy pencil brush rather than being so compact like the e36 is so I'm gonna
7:35take that on the lower lash line and just really run that underneath and
7:38start building up that nice orange you transition color
7:41so now we have soared down first so it just looks like a nice just orangie
7:44underneath the eye transition shade
7:46no I'm going back in with that - 36 just kind of just off whatever color you have
7:50left another 30-60 might have a little bit of Aphrodite left for taking fat pay
7:53and that's not going to her corner and talk about half way in to the I the
7:58beautiful like brownish maple shade is just stunning
8:01I free to go about halfway in on the e36 pencil brush just kind of buff out and
8:06give me some more color and dimension on the outer corner taking in be 43 I swear
8:11expressions like my life saver taking me 43 buy morphine and Aphrodite one more
8:15time and that's gonna go tight line on the bottom lash line
8:18about one-third in
8:24just to keep the darkness on the outer corner just like i did with the top and
8:30doing the same thing on the bottom like this and then taking the e36 and
8:33blending that out a little bit more just what it looks so harsh and start there
8:38and then grabbing any nude liner i'm going to take the tart in a room liner
8:42the new chairman put on the inner rim of my I just going to be more of an open a
8:45wake look that's the look i like to go for with this shadow combination and
8:49then adding a little bit of mascara to the bottom lashes as well
8:53ok guys so it's going to me to see what I look like up close and personal
9:03and that is if my entire tutorial is about him coming I like chills just
9:06thinking about it because it's been so crazy but I'm just I'm so excited that

0:26weird someone hot mess
0:28so let's just jump right into it so many people requested for me to do that like
0:32green and wright smokey eye so I thought I would feel right now I'm kind of 6 i'd
0:36love to hear in my voice but i had the sniffles and so much i hate it as much
0:40as i can look around like you know I mean some let's just get right into the
0:44beyond hope you guys like it and let's just jump right in
0:49yeah
0:52first let's go ahead and we're going to do with the whole face today healthy so
1:01we're going to go in with the YSL fusion foundation in the color warm ivory this
1:07is a gift from one of my friends and must use it in a store window I had like
1:11a something facial hair beard this thing going on right now if you're gonna might
1:15as well do it more sheer to medium coverage foundation so it doesn't really
1:19interfere with the beard area i love this smell this foundation so until the
1:23roses and I was put on the back of my head and just smear it on and then we're
1:26going to go in with the morphe and 439 haven't used this pressure i keep
1:30hearing about great things about it's a huge cube-like buffing brush and so I'm
1:34really excited transplant out i'm just gonna present into my face the
1:37foundation in oh I get it
1:42project start using this one all the time he always tells me that such a
1:44great brush for like that your brush finish and foundations I feel like a
1:48little bit late for me i know i'm already like ghostly pale but I know
1:51these foundations a little bit like but for me I to go in with some people there
1:54a little bit lighter than me that we can always bronze up after you know and I
1:58try to avoid the under eye area as much as much as I can be somewhere I can go
2:01to concealer under that not only one with mac pro longwear concealer and NW
2:0620 minutes and golden heart I like to go pretty hammered concealer and on the
2:10islands to prime for our eye shadow and then we're going with the morphe m35
2:16which is basically the mini baby concealer version of them i am
2:20obsessed with the stretch i've been using it quite a lot actually and i love
2:23this because it really picks up anything I don't mean like all the excess product
2:26I don't need on the brush that shit huh week the fuck
2:32hey I was running the brush and you are i might need a little more coverage i
2:37usually have a little more breakouts my forward a little bit over with a little
2:40bit more foundation on that area i do love this foundation I really do
2:44don't think I mean I've said before the only thing i don't like about it is that
2:47if i have any dry patches it tends to pick up my dry patches a little bit and
2:50I don't like that all baby i need you to cover the show that's wrong with you
2:56I look like fucking Casper i'm using LA girl Pro powder

3:38taper paddle fluffy brush and the morphe control palette and we got the machine
3:42was going to run in my areas that i like to call the roll

5:23in with our escort or powder made with mack daddy remain fantasy which is
5:27basically that this reflect teal blue highlighter and I figured you to lip i'm
5:31doing a green right smoky why not go ahead with the highway it's different
5:36I don't give a shit Colonel the limited come to our spring that on the more
5:40people used to have in our area with I'm gonna dust it on the highlighted plans
5:47you just gave me this really cool very different kind of highlight you know
5:52like it literally looks like it's highlighted but it gives you that nice
5:56greenish tone to it can blame I think it looks super freaking cool
6:02I mean of course you guys don't have to go in with the Greenwich highlight but
6:04that's not normal but you know what I was thinking when I woke up this morning
6:10the first thought in my head was in life don't know what I'm gonna bloom
6:14yes page you had so now that we have that nice intense as they going on
6:20within that fluffy pressures really kind of just blend the two together the blush
6:25and highlight just kind of really married much better
6:27it's very different and I like it I don't give a shit so i would say that my
6:31face is pretty much time have we got into a thing um let's go ahead and do
6:37one I doubt the actually no we're going to browse I'm gonna go to the browser
6:40real quick off camera because I think forever and a time so I'll just go to my
6:45grams of camera and i'll be back so we have our brows done I I was really
6:51trying to go for more of a natural brow but it and start to turn more and more
6:54fleek as we continued so we'll just go with it i'm not going to come off and do
7:00it again
7:00oh just go right to it so that is i'm gonna try to do you guys say for the
7:04eyes more because you guys have been requesting me to do that suburbs really
7:08try to sell the shit and I just get nervous because my faith is my perfect
7:14ok that will resume into the eye area hope you guys are happy we're going with
7:18makeup geek beaches and cream on a sigma e40 that's not right into our crease
7:24area senior transition shade as you guys already saw we had already primed with
7:27um with a consistent format or you can go in with that teaches in current let's
7:31go right into our crease area donated you need to put that bitch in there are
7:36trying to quantify
7:37I'm i grabbed vanilla bean and make it as well it's this little light and and
7:44money sigma e30 to this is the white one from their material their Theory you
7:49lunch as someone our brow bone it's a mad light bone white highlight now we're
7:55going to go in with a sophie 345 you guys know about coming over to make a
8:01geek bitten estetica that's going to increase area just really just go right
8:06in start carbon crease and we're gonna go right above our creatures a little
8:13bit above it
8:14see that they're going with a 40 again and really tough out that bitten color
8:18we don't want to be too harsh and this is why it's so crucial to have a
8:22transition color down first so much easier it's blending out now that we
8:26have that transition ok
8:32bring it outwards as well i got my crown cramping
8:36well not only that color nice and blended we're gonna go in with the next
8:41general pencil in black bean that's a go right on top of our lid so i put a good
8:49around the center and i use my finger to rebut out the rest of it right up to the
8:55crease with this and the farther you go out the lighter you want to go on the
8:59pressure
9:00ok so we have that nice black sticky base down we're going to go in with
9:04being sugarpill love plus is this really dark deep red color and that one going
9:10to grab onto more fiji 15 it's just flat brush and really just press onto the
9:15black ok and having a black beast out first is going to really make that below
9:21that red color pop so much more keep packing arm right up to didn't
9:28ok now that we have that nice red base down go in a more fee and 443 now we're
9:33going to really start to bug out the edges of the black liner base with it
9:39okay to go right into their really focus on buffing out those corners and edges
9:46going to be a little bit tough to bust out but we really need to focus on
9:50having no hard lines
9:53keep just keep going and keep working with the color keep really focusing that
10:00left plus and buffing it outwards now let's go ahead with the e-40 is really
10:05buff out the edges even more they'll pack on more color if I notice it's it's
10:14missing some going a little bit past that black these so starting with
10:18something like that
10:21again the key with this look is really taking that time to bust out those edges
10:32make it look like it's not too harsh
10:35so now we're actually just give it more dimension to the I we're going to go in
10:38with the Anasazi a shadow called beauty mark which is like this deep plum purple
10:42brown that's sitting on the outer corner just kind of really married that black
10:45with that red ring really just press it in with little pencil brush
10:56and after you continue to blend blend blend blend blend you should get
11:01something like this I was grabbing a clean brush really blending out those
11:05edges and wanted to any harsh lines awesome so it's going to bottom now
11:10we're gonna grab that same Nicks black jumbo aunt flo letting me run around
11:16that underneath the eye
11:17you don't need me without going to grab that same 32 and really just buff out
11:27that black blend it outwards now we're going with sugar another triple shadow
11:35in the color adoring to this nice green pastel green color patty 32 gonna run
11:40the right on black right on top of them
11:47grab any clean brush and dust underneath that to give you a nice diffuse
11:56transition we don't any hard lines just start to look something like that for a
12:03little cute extra adding we're going to make a geek utopia pigment on the sigma
12:08e 21 as our inner corner highlight have a little bit more if you think it's
12:14necessary

1:39let's get into this one brand tutorial with Urban Decay i'm so excited to be
1:43doing this
1:44I haven't done one brand in a while that's what i did was totally believe
1:47first things first I'm gonna take the Urban Decay v6 setting spray but it's
1:50also like a priming spray and spray that all of the face
1:53I've heard great things about this is great
1:57I thought I had the d slick primer I don't know where the fuck I put it
2:02no idea i know i have it somewhere but I just lost track of all my shit I have no
2:06idea where I put it
2:07so as for now we're going to use this key success rate cool for foundation I'm
2:11gonna be going in with the naked skin a wait list in the shade 3.5 i'm actually
2:14not the biggest biggest fan of this foundation on my skin type tons of
2:18people are obsessed with this foundation and I know why it's absolutely beautiful
2:21on the skin
2:23however because I have more on the early side it doesn't seem to really like
2:26working in my favor
2:28I don't want no I'm taking on more feet and 4 39 and start buffing that into the
2:31skin
2:32give me a nice even coverage this is a really beautiful foundation i think it
2:35looks so so pretty
2:37however my school it is such a lightweight like watery consistency is a
2:43nice just like medium coverage and this is definitely a foundation for more
2:45people that are a combination normal or dry i think perfect the base is on and i
2:50think it looks pretty looks pretty good
2:52I think the base is very beautiful so now that is i'm going to be mixing a V
2:55weightless concealer with the cleric correcting fluid in the pink one
3:00someone take first the actual concealer party that's gonna go right underneath
3:04my eye like right about yeah do that
3:08oh my god so this is what it's like to have more of a new one okay although i
3:11have this fucking dingy living here here here knows a little bit highlighted to
3:18fail and seeing the color corrector the pink why I'm still here right underneath
3:21here a little bit not too much really just what kind of bringing the whole
3:24thing in terms of looks fucking white which how things are going to get there
3:30and
3:30I'm gonna take a damp Beauty Blender and start to blend all that out then blend
3:35into the foundation
3:37I am so beyond obsessed with this concealer you guys this is one of the
3:40best can see there's I've ever tried ever and that's like saying a lot
3:44because I've tried a lot of concealers this could actually be the best I've
3:46ever tried this one and like the mac pro longwear and the it
3:50bye-bye under i believe it's called bandra awesome so now we have all the
3:53highlight blended together i'm going to set it really quickly
3:57I'm i said it with this medium light powder biomedical obviously this is like
4:01a face powder but he's underneath my eyes to set what's going on because it's
4:05all that on the morphe 48
4:07I'm the type of person that if I don't set my concealer increases increases
4:11like gnarly like not normal creasing like I'm talking craters
4:16I'm talking creators so just going to set it basically everyone i put the
4:20concealer i'm going to set with this powder as well and then for the rest of
4:23the face I'm gonna be taking it is HD powder Byron ok this is there naked
4:27medium light on a big power brushes of the 41 by Murphy and I'm going to run
4:32all over the rest of the face I didn't put that lighter complexion powder just
4:37so i can set everything in place
4:38I definitely need to set this face because it will move so much
4:44this foundation powder HD powder by urban it's so nice it's the most
4:48silkiest like lightweight beautiful powder like every project I told me
4:52about a while back and then after he talked about is when i started using it
4:55and I honestly haven't stopped by bring it to like all my events with me like I
4:58where all the time it's all good
5:00it's such a lightweight beautiful HD powder like it says what it is and you
5:04like such a smooth like application and appearance look at my face
5:07come on smooth ok now we're going to bronze up the skin I'm gonna take the
5:12Urban Decay beach the bronzer in the shape bronze this is like they're darker
5:16bronzer this color
5:19basically I was trying to get a life and dimension back to the face on the morphe
5:22- great just kind of powder brush to bronze up the skin
5:26I like to interchange between this one and the five to seven and i believe it's
5:29called
5:29I don't have a contour color by urban so we're going to do is going to make it
5:34work with this i know i'm doing a one regulatory with urban decay
5:37I definitely want to get towards like summer ending bronzy and like just
5:42and pretty you know what it means that's kind of what I'm going forward with the
5:44skin and this bronzer is so beautiful
5:47I'm looking like I'm having some color come on miami son
5:51give it to me to give myself more of a cleaner appearance but just like its
5:54kind of muddy on the bottom here
5:56I to have like more of a clean contour line I'm gonna take that same be 48 and
5:59that same powder that we used earlier and you have to kind of clean underneath
6:03the bronzer to get more of a sharp appearance just like this to the already
6:08just makes us different like it looks sharper and more defined it's not like
6:12it's dramatic when i click on there anything i just made some nice just
6:14subtle little difference like nothing too crazy
6:17another bronze to fail I'm gonna be taking the fetish blush on the morphe
6:21three
6:22this is like a really pretty mabi blush start brushing it onto the skin it's
6:27like a pretty much of color can see that it's free and it's highly the skin i'm
6:34gonna go ahead and take a two-hour powder blush in the shade sin you guys
6:38this highlighter is one of those pumpkin one's ever really good things about it
6:42actually haven't tried to get my first time trying on more feet
6:45I'm not more p310 let us see how this works
6:48oh she hey is me in my light
6:53it's only popping highlight for sure oh my god bless afraid of this highlight
6:58right now I think the blushes like home
7:00not me you know and let's go to move on to the eye area
7:05okay great so for the brows what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be taking it
7:07be a brow beater micro-fine brow pencil
7:11ok in the shade dark I'm just gonna run up to browse all right to do my brows
7:14honestly like to start from the bottom of the brow feather backwards
7:18I like to keep most of the product on the bottom part of my brow rather than
7:23the top like to have more of a clean line down here like this we have a nice
7:26just really defined brow line now and then we're going to fill it in
7:30naturally just very very very lightly nothing too heavy and now want to have
7:35the desired thickness of the brow
7:37i'm going to be taking route camera which is a little basically tinted brow
7:41gel and run that through the brow
7:43it's a tamer it's about Taylor came the brows digging this broad timber those
7:49no the brows I privatized already i just took the urban a concealer the negative
7:53way this one on my eyes I should use the freaking the actual eye primer Medicaid
7:57it's so good primer potion
7:58can I may be thinking a lot of the single shadows by urban decay which are
8:02absolutely amazing
8:04they have a beautiful shadows the single shadows and i really do think they're
8:07very very pigmented very nice
8:09I'm i combined riff and ABC gum which is like this vanilla shade and a sec orangi
8:13muted shade and that's gonna be like are basically our transition crease color
8:16and sit on the morphe 27 code many of you wait for ten percent off Lou
8:20shameless plug and morphe brushes . com
8:23and in store I love that brand I love that brand so much
8:27I'm taking actually a little more of the riff shade which is that like burnt
8:31orange a muted color
8:32oh my i did kind of bronzy because my face I feel like is more on the bronzy
8:36glow sign all the same thing for the highest i want like the whole look to be
8:39very very cohesive now have this is really just muted orange shade down now
8:44but this single shadow in the back which is like more of a dark cool toned brown
8:49and actually go on the most outer corner just to give me some more definition and
8:51dimension on a morphine and 433 a very pretty cool tone brown eyed people use
8:56for the brows
8:56I can see someone using this on the browse for sure
9:00let it out with the same he 27 with no additional part just to make sure it's a
9:03nice blend so now i'm going to do is I'm going to take the shade x which is I
9:07really cool golden peach duochrome shade
9:11absolutely stunning are you joking me
9:14this is like everything and then I mix it with the shadow called cosmic which
9:18is like a very glittery white shade
9:21I just like mixing these two combined will give me a really cool intense like
9:24glowy look and I'm just gonna go for it
9:26take it on my finger first time taking X on making your first and just going to
9:30fucking town man

10:13with that wrist shadow
10:15I'm gonna take it on a 36 and run underneath my lower lash line to start
10:18to really mesh together the top and the bottom of the lash line
10:22I just want to make sure everything is very cohesive taking it about like two
10:25thirds of the way in because the eye is very very more on the neutral site i
10:29want to take a little bit of a pop of color and I grabbed the 24-7 glide on
10:32pencil in the shade abyss which is a good a glittery blue shade i believe I'm
10:37gonna run that in the water lining my eyes are watering to take a bitch give
10:45me a little pop of something a little pop color so I have a couple of glitter

10:53I use on my cousin so late when i did that inner corner thing i'm going to do
10:55the exact same thing just adding a little bit inner corner pop but I feel
10:58like the people go better with the blue in a minor so I do pink
11:03haha ok I'm gonna bring the K heavy metal glitter in junk shell that sounds
11:09disgusting but I live for it
11:10now we're going to apply that on the inner third of the way I something very

11:20them both i don't i don't know what i would do that
11:22add a small amount of the gold a little bit further in
11:25okay great so you have something like this just a nice little pop of glitter

1:09right so let's go ahead and get this bitch star kid
1:12ok first things first have obviously had my foundation and I might like based on
1:16my highlight and contour done i'm just going to focus on the island today
1:19because i like is more on the internet site so i figured i was saying time you
1:22guys are interested in seeing my full face like routine i link my last
1:26property tutorial down below if you guys are interested in that shit so you can
1:29see like what i did my face go so now first things first we're going to prime
1:34my eyelids are going to use the mac prolongwear concealer as our primary
1:37uses printer quite often I just like it because it cancels out any darkness and
1:41render some I had when I said it was some powder it just it doesn't crease on
1:44me
1:44alas all day i really like it and I'm gonna go ahead and set it with a very
1:48light just translucent powder I just wanted to be able to be blended into a
1:51little bit easier so i'm just using the translucent powder music Laura Mercier
1:54translucent I'm actually pretty excited to do today's video because I have a
1:57plan to do a cool tone is like my plan I have a plan to do a cool tone so I'm
2:01like yes I can do this and I do warm tones all the time try to be brave into
2:04cool tones so this is my color palette scheme for today that it's very cool too
2:08i think it's really pretty
2:09I think that work out pretty well so which means some luck mama needs it so
2:14first things first we're going to start with the sigma e40 and going with
2:18peaches and cream and
2:19that's going to increase this is my makeup geek it's my favorite transition
2:22shade of all time
2:23it's just a great shape because it's very neutral it's not too warm soft cool
2:26because we advise transitions got my shadows can blend into them way easier
2:30than if I could without it
2:32that makes sense making shadows are my favorites house like all time basically
2:36like I said we're together so what's so good and they're only six but like I
2:40just basically me like they slay me hard i'm gonna go ahead and take a more feet
2:44and 43 and I'm gonna take a little bit of barcelona beach that's going to go
2:47into increases well i'm going to kind of mix it in with that beaches and cream I
2:50want to be a little more cool tone and this partial on beach is a very cool
2:53tone neutral brown i'm gonna go ahead and put that to the crease and blend
2:58that into the cranial Angela Sun so now i'm actually gonna go in with dusty rose
3:04by Anasazi beverly hills and that is also going to increase with morphine for
3:0833 and this is going to really help bring that cool tone in a single right
3:11into the crease with it
3:17take it all the way into the front of the crease go back in with missing money
3:2140 and blend that how we don't want our transitions you know letting out wasnt
3:25it 40 is just it's so crucial to me and I do this all the time because know
3:29you're watching channel you guys feel what I'm feeling you feel in it let me
3:33being cool toned feel proud though before I forget I'm gonna go ahead and
3:36grab on to use on associate black eyeshadow on a sophie 315 that i'm just
3:41going to toss onto my highlighted area so i'm actually not this is be brave
3:45we're gonna go in with the Duchess shadow by makeup geek very tiny baby
3:50amount of it fell off and i wanted to add a little more purple to it i think
3:53it's going to be pretty with a little buffer bonus to it that the corner and
3:56then taking it up very slightly into the crease and blending that out with an e
4:0140 it's gonna help bring this nice cool tone purpleness to the look and I think
4:04it looks so sick
4:06dr. of a little further in because they look sickening very light almost
4:12non-existent pressure it feels like you're not touching yourself you're
4:15doing a right to blend with that you 40 again she looks something like this nice
4:19little cool tone purpley grayish crease
4:23yeah i'm gonna go ahead and grab moondust shadow by naked geek and it's
4:27like a nice pretty chill bead took color what area are waiting on a more features
4:34team now we're going to press on to the lid is going to be our base shadow it's
4:38a very cool tone topi color now go in without and 43 and with no additional
4:42product actually kind of blend out the edges and then for like the sitting part
4:47i'm gonna take on another bogey hills shadow metal on my finger so that I'm
4:52not gonna run on my lid and it's looking out for intensity is that she is
4:55sickening I'm gonna take that on the lid and press that on over moondust just
5:02like shimmery intensiveness fuck man i was more one more one more
5:07I'm gonna take fix+ on that same g15 spray the bitch with things get it wet
5:12this nice intense metallic look I mean fucking cool tone for the first time
5:18like ever let me go crane was gonna take a little bit of metal in my inner corner
5:23as well give me that intense
5:26highlight we're gonna grab the am or PM 507 which like a little tiny baby tapir
5:31brushes don't kill and I go in with correct shadow by making a geek and I'm
5:35gonna run on the outer corner very lightly and nothing too intensely a
5:39little V I don't want to be too intense because i want to keep that purple like
5:44very prominent but i do want a little bit darker
5:46thank goodness for this little pointed brush but this shit is precise as hell
5:49and i'll go back in with it and for 33 and just kind of blend out that even
5:52more to have something like this
5:54the top of the lid I know me because I'm not a little pencil brush and I'm gonna
5:57grab makeup geek my beaches and cream and mix it in with dusty rose by Anasazi
6:02beverly hills and around underneath my lashline I'm really trying to get that
6:05nice greatest dusty rose color go in and then on a more precise morphine and 508
6:11which is a very tiny little bit of talked about this before it's great
6:13getting underneath the lash line i'm gonna take that same depth shadow i'm a
6:16geek and that was gonna run underneath my lashline very close to my last thing

1:39video and subscribe to my channel if you aren't already but yeah let's go and get
1:43into this look okay great so let's go and start this tutorial i already have
1:49the face completely done like I just wanted to have the face out of the way
1:53you know the facings forever and I've been doing a lot of full face stuff
1:55recently so much you know what
1:56it's okay let's get back to the face today and the right
2:00so only using a couple shades because this is gonna be more of a natural look
2:02I only have four so it's going to start with this bad boy
2:06great huh I live with this weird thing
2:09ok so first thing we're going to go in with peach smoothie by making week I
2:13know it's different for me about using beaches and cream
2:15this is gonna be a little more on the natural side i really don't need to do
2:18like a transition or anything like that
2:19finding morphy 27 brush right now this is like basically my favorite like
2:22fluffy blending brush this reminds me look at me 40 x sigma but a little bit
2:26softer so that's why I like it so much
2:27that's just gonna go to the crease because this look is so gonna be on the
2:30natural side
2:31I'm not being me with this whatsoever i'm putting into the crease and then
2:34just kind of do what I want with it and I'm gonna take another one my favorites
2:38favorites from makeup geek it's called frappe it's this gorgeous neutral brown
2:43like I who I left my pay I can I love trapping and I don't really use on my
2:47channel lot but using more in real life but something is out on the outer corner
2:50and then running out to the little bit and concentrating on the outer corner
2:54and just keeping it out there as well as by the lash line and this is just to
2:57give it some more added dimension to look I'm not really doing anything I'm
3:00not doing too much anything crazy just getting a little more dimension so when
3:03you look at the I it gives you more of a WOW factor rather than just being a flat
3:07surface you know what i mean and for me special especially because I have kind
3:11of like hooded lids going on so I'm like let me just go ahead and not accentuate
3:14that thanks thanks love you so much
3:16basically the whole thing is like neutral and brown or something like that
3:19I'm gonna go in with I'm speechless by making because well it is just one of
3:23their new duochrome shades
3:25basically what it is like a gold that reflects peach I thought it would be
3:28such an easy fun way to incorporate a little bit of color on the lid but not
3:31too much because i want to keep more of the natural science going to place a
3:33little bit almost like on the inner corner at the inner third of my eye
3:35using my finger to just kind of blend that peach lip shade out
3:39oh it's so cute machine put on the whole lid because i think it's actually really
3:43really pretty
3:44I haven't used to get something like shocked I who tell me that's not cute as
3:48fuck and 43 again just kind of putting out those edges a little bit of blend in
3:52again we're not being too neat so now we're going with am or PM 508 which is a
3:56small little smudge brush is very flat like that and then I'm gonna take
3:59corrupt make it because well it's just going to be a little bit of black shadow
4:03I'm taking a very small baby amount of it i'm just going closest to the lash
4:07line with that because I'm not gonna do I know what this whatever they want to
4:09keep it more than natural side but I want to keep a nice amount of definition
4:12of my lashes so i'm gonna do is i'm going to run that corrupt shadow along
4:16my lash line and even like bring it up a little bit over here
4:20make it look like a shadow
4:22just not very very very subtle smoked out like lash line at the top
4:27so now i'm going to take a little bit of the trade show lead liner by next time I
4:30put that on my waterline it's the brown one
4:32I actually really like this brown liner because it's like a gel liner go . a
4:36little coat of mascara I'm gonna take my roller lash by benefit my favorite
4:38mascara and I put a little code of that on my lashes
4:42while the curl just do a quick little coverage the cute little coat a little
4:46mascara focus on me
4:48lean on me playing in a strong but i'll be afraid so
4:57so now that we have the eyes done already have mascara on top and the
5:00bottom i use the glass for the bottom as always you guys already know I don't
5:03want to show you guys because they're just feel like you know I'm gonna take
5:05the new balance and flashes in the style
5:08serengeti which is a different style for me i'm not using Bellamy know you guys
5:11proud this is like more of a flare like a wispy pair they have a couple of
5:14shooting out past like the original length
5:17I don't know how to explain them feels like they have a lot of layers just why
5:23don't you just don't stick okay let's find some sticks at school no like this
5:27there's this really cool intense like spidery effect that spidery but they
5:30actually look really really cool
5:32I think they look super super super badass what you think also about some
5:36I'm an affiliate you can save twenty percent off with a good man anyway
5:39that's a really cool affiliate program i think they're the they're one of my
5:42favorite failure to be part of because they actually take care of the customers
5:44on like a lot of the other last brands I've like worked with him like yo hook
5:48it up for my piece and they really do and I really appreciate that about them
5:51obviously the eyes r feeney that means they are done in a different language
5:56I'm like so everyone out towards chicken - yeah i am living for these lashes
6:01though like actually living breathing dying for them and see if they're even
6:04there
6:06I see what i'm going to do
6:10explain it
6:13perfect so we have our face completely done I'm going to the lips now i really
6:17want to go with a more fall intense lip because you guys had requested that so
6:20now I'm going to do I'm going to go in with first colour-pop lippie pencil in
6:25the shade poison thing is one of the newest collection is actually i'm not
6:28quite quite sure i think i'm a ruin our burning shade it's a very warm
6:33honestly like I don't mean I can't even get over the fact that the clip art
6:36pencils are so smooth and so good and they're only like five bucks
6:39you're not your mouth of the baboon's ass hole looking good
6:42so now that we have our lips lip line i'm gonna go ahead and with Heather's by
6:46Anasazi Beverly Hills is one of my favorite liquid lipsticks that they've
6:49ever done I think it's absolutely stunning and I think it's just good on
6:52literally every skin tone as long as you're confident wearing the shade you
6:55can pull it off I promise you like anyone can pull this color off its
6:58stunning

7:20us both when I overdraw like a mother
7:21bugger but why do i do that i don't know i don't know taking the laura mercier
7:26translucent again on a little powder brush
7:29I'm just gonna go ahead and do a little bit of cooking underneath that quantum
7:34ah wait a couple of thinking and then just gonna brush it away
7:37ok cool so now that is time for the eyes I wanted to a very pretty like subtle
7:42when designing shit shit what I want to do i don't know i'm gonna go with it i'm
7:46just gonna grab the palette I want to use I'm gonna go with it I'm gonna be
7:49taking the naked 3 by remote cabin use cotton so freaking long actually this
7:54one's a brand new one that I'm in case I mean if they like custom made it will
7:58expand on it I think it's super super cool that they do that thank you guys
8:00are gonna k feel like it's so easy to create a very romantic and soft look
8:04using this palette so that's why we're going to go into a more feet we have
8:09been that i know and i'm going to be taking the shade limit which is a very
8:13pretty just neutral like dusty pink essentially and that is gonna go into
8:17the crease and decide then this shade is a very beautiful just pinky base color
8:24and I feel like that look so nice with the range of soft romantic look oh look
8:27at it already it's so pretty
8:29not just go all the way into the crease all the way in using window wiper
8:32motions just very softly just blending that out and then i'm going to be taking
8:37a more fiemme for 33 which looks like this is like the 217 from Mac do poor
8:43like a sigma e25 whatever you want to call it im gonna be taking the shade
8:46nooner with this color is a very dusty pink little bit deeper than living color
8:50was gonna be taking that into the currents of the well this was going to
8:54be going a little bit lower
8:56right now we're just deepening the crease a little bit more nothing to him
9:00I just want to give it more dimension
9:01I'm really just keeping it on the outer corner i'm not going in far as in that
9:05we keep on the outer corner and then just take the e 27 again and just blend
9:08out that a little bit
9:10isn't this looks so soft and so pretty like I just looks so beautiful like I
9:14just wanna like be romanticize right now I want to take a bitch on a date I want
9:18hey sometimes they often it is not something i say often
9:22I just want to be like the Daniel
9:24shipping up i'm gonna go ahead and take a m3 26 and the shade of strange
9:29essentially it's a white color it's a very just creamy beige color and I'm
9:33gonna put that on the brow bone to highlight the brow bone a little bit
9:36with not just a match shade and then taking a packing brush I'm gonna be
9:40taking the shape burn out which is the third shade from the pallets and go
9:44right here
9:44so very just like sadnie peach shade the peachy pink sheet I don't know what that
9:49on the lid they look on the eyes I feel like I want to really look pretty and
9:52natural and it's going to take that and just lightly run that over the lid
9:56I don't look so pretty and so like romantic it's very soft and like DNT you
9:59know I want to do a wing but I want to do like a shadow
10:02I'm going to take off your hat - yeah
10:06okay , taking more feat e-40 3 which is a very just flat defining brush it is a
10:12great brush for anything of the kind of detail work and I take the shape black
10:15heart which is the last shade in the palette is the darkest one is a good
10:19black with like reddish reflect in it essentially i'm gonna be putting that on
10:22the lash line to make it nice and like defined without being too harsh
10:28which is whatever you want to do
10:33it's like we're tight lining with a shadow instead of eyeliner so we kind of
10:37intimidated by doing eyeliner is a really easy way to incorporate darker
10:41eyeshadow without being too hardcore you know and I'm gonna take that whatever i
10:46have left on the brush and just going to run that out here
10:49yeah
10:54take a more 5036 just kind of let out the outer corner a little bit with no
10:59additional product just because I want to keep it really soft
11:02let's still defined at the same time ok so in this is that what you have so far
11:06tonight it's just easy shadow extension
11:09I'm gonna take a little bit of concealer and just kind of clean that up a little
11:13bit you don't have to do this that if you want to keep it just kind of smoky
11:16and like soft do it dude like do your thing but i personally make it a little
11:20bit more clean on the edges just because I like that kind of luck and then just
11:23go ahead and do the other eye
11:25anyway so that's how the guys are basically done like I am good i don't
11:29need to do anything else with them I think they look just fine and I call my
11:33eyelashes and mascara off camera as well so what I'm thinking is I wanted to do
11:37lashes I'm you can keep this look at just how it is you don't need your
11:40lashes whatsoever
11:41you want to keep it soft and romantic like you don't need to that but I do
11:45need to do that because i'm a lash girl
11:47I'm gonna be taking the house of lashes iconic lashes i think this would be a
11:50really pretty lashes with this look because i do have that really nice like
11:53shadowy winged effect going on so I think it lasts like this which is really
11:56nice and extended on the outer corner will be really pretty
11:59pilots bad both I wish I was the one online as perfect as it looks but it
12:04doesn't
12:05honestly like I don't know if I like the way iconic look on me I feel like on
12:08everyone else look freaking bomb but on me i don't i don't know what you think
12:15give me your honest opinion I just really think my eyes look a little wonky
12:18but i don't i don't know i don't know
12:20so let's go into the bottom lashline really quickly I'm going to do something
12:22very subtle miss Amy 43 brush and I'm gonna take em
12:26nooner and limit mixed that's gonna go on the lower lash line just give me some
12:30how-to definition on the outer corner
12:32I don't want to keep it just so completely bare down here I still want a
12:35little some some more te 18
12:38it's going to blend out that a little bit i'm going to take the mac NW + 20
12:44what's this when are you a mac studio , graphic pencil in the nude shade and see
12:4815 nw20 and jumped on the lower lash line just kind of awake in my eyes a
12:53little bit more mac mascara on the bottom lash line
12:56my favorite mascara forgot to mention I put a little bit of that strange color
13:00on the inner corner of my mind with that same
13:03morphy detail brush nickel to the eyes are done now I'm going to you guys into
13:08that I look like up close
13:09and yeah
13:14yeah
13:15cool so we know what the is going to move onto the lips and then we'll be

1:45yeah that's going to get into this full face great girl bunny look
1:56ok so it's gonna get started on today's video bare-faced nothing on my face
2:00right now I wanted to do a cool thing to do today because tons of you guys like
2:03what I do full face videos so you know what I'm listening I'm listening to you
2:06guys i love you guys and I'm listening
2:08ok so first things first we're going to prime we're going to use the makeup
2:11every step 1 equaliser in the smoothing at the moment this is literally like my
2:14favorite port filling smoothing primer out there i would say that this one and
2:19benefit Porefessional are like my favorites
2:21so for foundation for today's choice we're going to be going in with the
2:24coach and OH
2:25aqua foundation i just love this foundation it's so freaking a pretty
2:29gonna take two pumps
2:30maybe two and a half maybe three let's be greatly I'm in the shade 123 and
2:35gives you a very nice lightweight coverage but it's very buildable so I
2:38really do love this and so I like to put this around the face and then of course
2:41I'll conceal on the areas that need a little more help icon to make my eyes
2:44and whatnot so we're going to take this on a Beauty Blender and just put this
2:48into the skin
2:49okay so I need a little more help on the forehead because i am breaking out a
2:52little bit on the forehead right now i just have been on to take the Loreal
2:54infallible in the 103 and just put a little bit of that on the forehead and
2:58maybe a little on the nose as well because this foundation is definitely
3:01one of the luminous dewy side and i want to add a little bit more coverage with
3:05the lorry oh and a little more magnifying effect in the t-zone
3:08so let's go ahead and can feel I'm gonna take the Makeup Forever HD concealer and
3:12y 2 3 i'm not using concealer and a fucking minute so I'm excited is however
3:17not really no I use this again
3:19squeeze ok yes squeeze honey squeeze away actually squeezing is kind of
3:24nothing
3:25use my finger inside a little bit on the back of the head and he's not here
3:29oh yeah are you going
3:30you're way more than I feel like it more guests look at that squeeze finger on
3:35the sides of my nose a little this country goes such a long way I love it
3:39go ahead and start blending it away how have you guys been I feel like I'm not
3:43filmed in a little bit of a minute
3:45no I'm just kidding films like fucking yesterday and the day before that what
3:48the fuck my things i like this consumer because it is very hydrating it's not
3:51like a trying to do whatsoever and so therefore increases less than a drying
3:56consider what so I really do like that effect of this concealer not going to
3:59set your under eyes with the laura mercier translucent setting powder or
4:02whatever how do you guys like that works for you
4:04I personally just like this Laura Mercier translucent powder because it
4:07works so nicely from my skin type it really sets everything in place it's
4:11lightweight but it's still heavy it sounds weird but it really is like a
4:15lightweight heavy powder
4:16it really works at keeping the coils are baked keeping you from creasing
4:18everything you could possibly want from a powder
4:21this really does ensure that and i'm using this on an 848 buy morphine
4:24you guys I need to tell you guys a secret not even see gracious
4:27I just want what's happening so morphy is discontinuing their elite collection
4:33brushes
4:34I know I know I'm devastated tons of people were telling me on twitter
4:38they were like okay so the brushes you've been using on your YouTube like
4:42you're linking looks like i do link on my brushes that you is on my description
4:45bar like I'm always pretty good with linking everything
4:48they're like hey the brushes that you're using are not available more for any
4:51more like what you mean so I go on Murphy site and they're not there so I'm
4:55like play
4:56so then I text the owner Murphy and I'm like you know so I'm just curious like
5:00the Lee brushes and what's going on with them what's happening
5:02so when he first came out with the lead brushes they were supposed to be limited
5:05edition and because they are so freaking popular they end up becoming kind of
5:11permanent or like staying on a lot longer than they originally going to so
5:14that's kind of like the backstory of the brushes
5:15what's going on is that they're actually coming out with a different set of
5:19brushes very similar to the elites and they're taking away the elite so if you
5:23guys are wondering like why the brushes i have been using have not been on site
5:27has not been on the website is because all the brushes that are Jerry now are
5:29the last ones of the lead brushes if you like any of the brushes that are there
5:32get em while you can because they are on sale and they'll be gone soon
5:35so for now just bear with me with the brushes
5:37i'm using because the these the ones i have so until they send me the next
5:40batch of the new brushes are using i will be using those two I have them just
5:43how one man just like the kind of even the title of today's video is using the
5:47swamp Queen palette by baby girl and tart
5:50she's doing everything club with her she didn't have a tarp like that's so

6:01beautiful
6:02I'm so so happy for you so I'm just gonna brought up the skin with sweet tea
6:05which is the bronzer in this palette on a more fee and five to seven which is
6:10still permanent on their site is like the mack do brush for the bronzer which
6:14turned into that a little bit
6:15oh its payment as fuck got it oh just a little bit off and then start wavin
6:21bronzing house color so this color is like a really warm
6:25terracotta brown with some gold shimmer to it
6:29it's very very very subtle it's not too intense but it just gives you a nice
6:32pretty bronzy color
6:34oh it is a beautiful beautiful color it's a little bit more on the like warm
6:38orange side of a bronzer but we are in summer so that's totally fine with me
6:41and I'm really into like warm orange browsers anyway it's actually funny
6:45because I get clock all the time on social media
6:47my bronzer being too warm for my skin brown like if I like it I like it bro
6:51feel like a fucking watch it
6:53it is this so-called like all these youtubers coming out with collaborations

7:01proud of all these youtubers clapping with different brands and not only just
7:04small Instagram brands but I huge brands like tar and like Nikki tutorial is

7:12so amazing to see these brands interesting to youtubers enough to want
7:17to collaborate with them and yes
7:18nikki jackson and Bonnie are all fucking huge youtubers and they're all the
7:22killing of the Queens of the game but still like the brand interested them
7:26enough they're not celebrities are not in movies you know I mean to endorse a
7:29product
7:30it's just so cool to see youtubers get this kind of like reaction and get these
7:33kind of opportunities even though they're just on youtube
7:36you know what i mean so it's just so cool to see that and I'm just very proud
7:39of everyone that's done club so far and too
7:41how they keep coming and I hope they're just as amazing as the ones that have
7:45been coming out
7:45i'm going to highlight the under-eye really quickly with my Marc Jacobs
7:47instant mark of course be 48 same brush I'm just going to highlight the under
7:52part of my eye and I'm also gonna take a little bit of that powder and run it
7:55underneath my bronzer to make it more of a clean sharper appearance
7:59it doesn't look so money in harsh you feel me and I was like a little bit of
8:03mac shade stir just contour a little bit underneath the bronzer on a new brush my
8:08morphe this is the g40 it looks really like a awesome contouring brush and I
8:12tried it once and I loved it so I'm gonna keep trying it
8:15see what I think about it and so is gonna dip into it barely not too much
8:19it's small and define but it like I feel like it was really like contour bitch
8:23out you know
8:24so let's go into our country a little bit yeah see I knew like I fucking knew
8:28this was going to be a bomb ass contour brush like I just knew it was gonna take
8:31a big fluffy brush and run over it the whole thing just make sure there's no
8:34harsh lines and edges to make everything a little soft and date here again
8:39of course I'm taking the blood shots in this palette this is the blush called
8:42does this thing really work and I think that's from her series on youtube like
8:46does this really work so i can take that money more 53 brush or any kind of blush
8:50brush that you want to use use that brush and I'm just going to lightly dust
8:54oh my god is painted was going to very lightly press and dust off
8:59it's like a pinky blush with some golden flecks in it goes into a light layer of
9:02this please tell me a little bit of a very pretty soft pink layer
9:07ok course we have the blush on now and let's go ahead and highlight because
9:11there's a highlighter this bag - it's called Gator wings
9:15that is the most perfect name for bunny I've ever heard it's so adorable get
9:19your wings
9:20so we're going to highlight with that color and i love the blush i think it's
9:22very very very pretty and it will be universally beautiful and so many
9:26different skin tones so I think they did an amazing job with that
9:29so it's one highlight a little bit i'm gonna take a more feet and 5 10 and I
9:33think honestly the whole type out this is one of the most excited for is the
9:35high later because it is absolutely stunning
9:38so freaking pigmented you need to be careful with this whore because it is
9:42intense
9:43put in the best way and i can just see like it just come on
9:50come on dude look at this highlighter like what the freak basically the
9:55champagne gold chain
9:56it's a very very very lightweight and it almost looks good but it can be white on
10:00some tones but it's a very just beautiful champagne gold has gold
10:04undertones in its own University studying on so many different skin tones
10:07so I think again
10:09such a beautiful highlighter it's a very intense like I love it was funny to like
10:14with highlighter
10:15I get a lot of hate on the amount of highlight I put on and like a lot of
10:18like people a lot of people say that like it doesn't look good on me and it
10:21emphasizes my texture and what not and it's like yo if I have texture which I
10:25do
10:26I'm a fucking do have big pores like whatever I have texture why why I avoid
10:31something if you have texture like who cares who cares like I used to be so
10:35insecure about my texture on my skin and I would want to avoid highlighter
10:38because I was so scared of what people would say because I do have like texture
10:41of my skin but now I'm like I live you do not give us a single solitary titty
10:46about what people say about my texture because i have texture and living with
10:50it
10:50who gives a shit if you want to wear a fucking pound of highlight on your face
10:53just do it doesn't matter what anyone is saying about your face your texture of
10:56your skin do it is what makes you happy if it makes you happy to it I went to
10:59worry about the highlighter and yes i have texture of my skin yes i have bumps
11:02on my face but I'm just like so please do you guys like it please we're headed
11:07uh-huh so ya don't the face I'm gonna go and finish off with the eyes now okay
11:11cool so we are back now my brows are done and my eyes are primed that's going
11:16it started with the eyes now i'm so excited to be doing this tutorial
11:20actually asked you guys on Twitter and snapchat we just wanted to see if you
11:23guys want to see more of a bold I dramatic look or a natural i love with
11:27the more bold lip I think it's literally like fifty two percent was bold
11:31I look and the rest was natural look I'm gonna just follow you guys are asking of
11:35me and I'm going to a bold dramatic i look with this power today
11:38so first things first we're gonna go in with natural peaches on a more feet 27
11:41rush just any kind of fluffy blending brush will work and i'm going to take
11:45this shade into the crease
11:47this is a very pretty and natural transition like peachy shade is Larry
11:51called natural peaches so that's what it is
11:54it's a natural peach transition
11:56so we're taking morphine and 43 which is very similar to the back to 17 to do for
11:59it
12:00absolutely love this but I literally have like seven of them they're so good
12:03you can always use a code me anyway and all caps to save on more fee
12:07I'm an orphan affiliate you guys probably know this by now you guys know
12:10me you guys know that they're just my favorite I i absolutely love more feat
12:13so I'm gonna take this brush and I'm gonna take a man cat on it which is a
12:17purple deep plum shade and that's going to go into my crease extremely extremely
12:23pigmented holy and that's just going to go into a crease all the way to the
12:28inner corner because this look is going to be more dramatic
12:30I'm not to get Marky 23 and blend out the top portion just make sure there's
12:33no harsh lines or edges I really just don't like harsh lines when blending
12:37I've been doing any I looks even if I'm supposed to have a harsh line
12:41I don't like it I'm actually taking it from the bottom of my lower lash line
12:44out because I'm gonna make this whole entire look pretty smoky
12:48so you should have something like this so far so now i'm going to go in with a
12:51I base
12:52I'm already primed about going with a different base i'm going to take the
12:55pure I polish base top coat in the shade caviar
12:58it's a very very like dark greenish gold shade and it's perfectly i want to go on
13:02my lid i want to take the shape
13:04sippy sippy which is a very deep mob brown but has tons of gold glitter in it
13:10so I think they'd be just perfect
13:12combined with these i'm going to take this pure I polish with this little pure
13:15applicator and put that on the lid close to the lash line and blend it out as
13:22well
13:23I was grabbing a fluffy brush and blending out the edges of the high
13:26polish taking more of that man cat shade i'm going to blend out the edges a
13:29little bit just to make sure everything is nice and blended and then we'll be
13:34going over that I base with sippy and I'm gonna take a little packing rush i'm
13:39just going to take the one that are already provided in this palette is just
13:42it's already here and we'll take the shape of a sippy sippy which is a very
13:44dark brown plum with basically like gold greenish or reflect clear in it and you
13:49have to be careful because this this shadow is pretty powdery only because it
13:54is a lot of glitter in it so it will pick up a lot so just be sure to really
13:57wipe off the brush when you're doing it dusted off with your finger and then pat
14:02on into patting motions right over the eyeshadow base that we used
14:10ok guys you have this is so far it's a very very very very intense smoky outer
14:16corner I what I did off camera acts like was trying to figure out how to like
14:19blend out the crease without getting too like blurred and blended together what I
14:24grabbed was dog man a little bit on and 43 and i blended right in between the
14:29darkest part of the purple and my skin tone just to give me some more life back
14:34into the list because everything was so cool to do starting to look a little
14:36more like black I punched me in the eye kind of thing and then it starts to
14:39happen had a little more work to look at it will literally save the look I swear
14:43to you it will
14:44I'm just got more feet and 42 to get a little packing brush and the shade big
14:48baby i'm gonna put on the brow bone just a little bit just give me a little bit
14:51of a brow lift right here
14:53definitely just be careful with that sippy sippy shade because it does have a
14:56lot of glitter in it and there will be a lot of follow if you aren't really
14:59paying attention
15:00I did get a lot of fallout when I was packing it on and it was kind of ruining
15:02my makeup so I like three like put on powder on my face
15:07just be careful with it's nothing i mean it's a glittery shade most glittering
15:09shades out fallout just a forewarning for you guys so we're going to just
15:13gonna keep blending out this crease to make sure that there's no harsh edges
15:16i wish i had more lid space man this is not another one more let's go into a
15:20wing
15:21I feel like a wing will also help as well to make something a little more
15:25cohesive and blended together
15:26so go ahead and doing whatever kind of thing you want to do if not i mean you
15:29don't have to of course of course you don't have to because it's just like if
15:31you guys want to but i do want to i'm going to take my Kat Von D trooper liner
15:36i'm going to create a wing from the bottom of the lash line out words like
15:39so what's going to dramatically in that ok
15:45just going to start filling that in one family as fuck
15:49ok cool so I'm gonna go ahead and finish off with the eyes now I'm going to the
15:52bottom of the i originally I was going to do man cat and keep it all clean and
15:57purple down here but because i feel like it all started going to mesh together
16:01with everything I had a lotta orange and warm , to bring it back to life
16:05I'm just going to continue on with the orange and warm tones underneath my lash
16:08line just to make sure we don't like clothes off anything and make it look -
16:11Mike black I kind of thing so i'm going to mix natural peaches and dog man again
16:17on my lower lashline I'm gonna bring that all the way in to make sure
16:22everything looks little bit more warm and alive
16:25I'll try my best to do like a cool tone look but honestly it's so easy to go
16:30from like a cool tone two dead in the second and a fucking second it's so fast
16:35ok cool so then I want to have a little bit as well just because we gotta do it
16:40we have to do it i'm going to take a more feet m three to six and i'm
16:44actually gonna take Gator wings with that in the inner corner just really
16:48give me some life back to the eye and waking everything up a little bit on the
16:53brow bone as well a very small amount so it's going to take a cream color liner
16:56in my waterline which of course you guys can do that would be so absolutely
17:00beautiful but because this is great girl as her palate and she's so bold and
17:04intense and really really cool imma take a bold water line color
17:07I'm gonna take the colour-pop crybaby the lavender pencil
17:11I don't put that in my waterline just give me to open the way luckily because
17:14it is a light baby lavender color it's still going to open my eyes but not be
17:18like the classic wider beige color
17:20I don't have been wanting to do some more fun incorporating some more fun
17:24colors so this is what I wanted to know so you can barely even tell that it's
17:27purple it just looks like a cool lighter color amazing to go and curl your lashes
17:31and apply some mascara and policies if you would like
17:34okay guys so this is what it looks like with the lashes and lighter and
17:37everything is on with mascara and everything they can turn out so freaking
17:41cool in its of sexual and like Smokey and very light come hither bitch or you
17:46die kind of thing so it looks like i'm going to you guys in to see what they
17:49look like up close
17:50yeah

17:56and just for reference that the lashes i'm wearing our Russian at black Bayou
18:00about some and they have been my favorite lashes recently i just am so
18:04loving them so much and they felt they just go with every single look so that's
18:08why I don't like them

18:12graveyard girls colors that she did with tar this is in the shade

2:58it's not going to get into this full face get ready with me a drugstore
3:02addition I'm so excited I'm done drugs for video and so freaking long and i
3:06have so many with always request me to do more drug store things so please get
3:10ready
3:11drugstore addition a blurry all these drugs are probably from me
3:14that's why we're going to using two day I'm gonna go in with first the Loreal
3:19magic Lumi primer and it's a really good illuminating primer it does give you a
3:24nice luminous finish to your foundation and i just noticed that I'm doing more
3:28of a mattifying foundation like the t-zone even with this primer
3:31i'm good to go to work today so i'll be pretty good perfection so i'm going to
3:35go in with the Maybelline matin pour this foundation in the shade 120 and
3:39that's gonna be my t-zone foundation and on about it and I'm gonna do something
3:44else on the rest of the face is because i have extra just for foundations I want
3:47to use them all and honestly like for me I don't know what it is about me but I
3:50don't want to do just one foundation on the face like that i always feel like
3:55such a mix freak with our nation's collective you you know if you like one
3:58foundation for one thing
4:00why not use another foundation for something else that you like in a
4:03different area so that's why i like to do something to the T zone is completely
4:06covered with a foundation and so now for the rest of the face i'm going with the
4:09lorio to match a looming cushion foundation which is such a good ass
4:14foundation it's absolutely stunning it just gives you such a beautiful like
4:17luminous like life like glow to the skin and it's a good nice coverage like
4:21medium coverage very buildable it's just awesome so does it suggest this one
4:24so you're more on the dry side to this is a great one I'm gonna go with more
4:28feet and 4 39 and literally just got soaked her up and we're gonna go in and
4:33start buffing this foundation all over the skin and I'm also taking you down
4:37the neck as well I don't like doing this or what so ever i'm taking a liquid on
4:41the neck hate it but just for the purpose of matching and not having to
4:44use another powder
4:45I'm just gonna take it down the neck for today ya he fucking so for concealer
4:51might take the Maybelline master conceal this is such a good concealer it's like
4:57freakishly behind i'm obsessed with it to be honest I'm she needs a little bit
5:01of that on my knees a little real techniques sponge to blend it out and
5:04amusing about taking sponge just like this take up being like throwing star
5:09no that's so cool such a pretty conceal its such a creamy full-coverage
5:13concealer like to recommend any to consider for the drugs with
5:16nice and full coverage creamy and it really does cover like what you need to
5:20get covered
5:21maybelline master conceal freakishly bomb and not for the sake of being a
5:25brighter I'm gonna take the Loreal magic Lumi pen which is like another listing
5:30of highlighting a little . i really do love this pendous works really nicely
5:33just so i kinda illuminate a little bit more
5:35I really want to do the five minute makeup challenge haven't seen tons of
5:38people do it recently about you Jeffrey and Nikki kind of like started the trend
5:42up again just because I've been saying it all over the place a little bit more
5:45and actually gonna be so fun to do you know what i mean so you guys have any
5:49suggestions of any other youtubers that you would like to see me do with the
5:52five minute makeup challenge with let a bitch know in the comment box below
5:55because that I rockin around but i think that we really really really fine you
6:00know it needs a little you guys would want to see me to that way and I think
6:03that'd be just such a fun
6:04that's a video i've never tried to do a makeup in five minutes I don't know man
6:07i feel like i would actually really did terribly but you never know
6:10and I want to come on practice or anything I'll be good until i actually
6:12have to do it at once that's all blended out nicely i'm gonna take the maybelline
6:16fit me powder in the shape 110 which is that the porcelain asked shade
6:19just to set the underlying powder this is such a nice finely milled powder and
6:23I remember you think I've been doing this one and i think i'm going to try
6:26that and so I tried it on my first drug store video and it turned out so nicely
6:29and I was like what
6:32on my morphe 48 amazing little pointed setting brush so good and for the rest
6:39of the face I'm gonna take this big daddy brush the 41 and labeling fit me
6:43matan poreless powder because i have two met I just have two of them
6:48the freaking bomb i wanted to buy in something you know what these are
6:50freaking bomb these powders are super super get their money studio fix powder
6:53by Mac but like a cheaper drugstore version of them out i just really like
6:57them
6:57this is the shade 130 and I'm gonna run that all over the face just to set the
7:00rest of the face lightly nothing too heavy just to give me a little bit more
7:04coverage as well as set the face for the rest of the day so I never tried this
7:08product i really want to try to on camera this is the Maybelline master
7:11contour palette
7:12ok this is like a nice like contour color blush highlighter todo todo in
7:16here is everything and take this on the morphe to the contour color and
7:20bronzing up the skin color is just going to be a nerve
7:26do you want
7:29you know what it fucking works it works it does what we need to do we need to
7:32bring up the skin and it brought up the skin that looks a little pinky that i
7:37can literally feel like the brown so it's a little pink
7:39yeah actually goes a little pinky but you know what we're gonna go with it you
7:42know what's cool about these powers over that they're actually very very
7:44pigmented like it really has good as pigmentation for sure
7:50also i'm using it in the shade medium has any suggestions for any good
7:53drugstore bronzers I would be really really cool
7:55he doesn't suggest me some that are high quality like good good drugstore
7:58bronzers that are not patchy the pigment in there nice and good luck sir roger's
8:03I would really love for you guys to suggest me some because i don't have a
8:06single job on sir
8:07not one not a single charge your browser and I'm like okay I'll just depending on
8:11this little master palette to to get me through it but it's not working out for
8:15you like it's not really like my clothes I usually like to go in with bronze or
8:19whatever but we're going to make it work because I am what unspookable bitch you
8:23can't clock me
8:24I think you really can but yeah so we're going to go in with the little blushes
8:28what - well like the bus is here
8:29well they don't you three just kinda just a little bit this looks really
8:32pigmented so be careful
8:34you want to a nice light flush of it nothing to him
8:37it's a nice like matte pink black just a nice pretty color
8:40mm thank you and because it's also there
8:43we're going to go in with a little highlighter as well this is the
8:46highlight number three color and everything down and more for you and 310
8:50fan brush just to highlight the skin
8:52she's here let's do it I haven't tried this highlighter you haven't read any of
8:57the power yet this is actually a really pretty
8:59glowy color it's nice
9:03oh yeah that is that that works for me oh hi
9:07cool we basically have the face completely done now this is what I'm
9:09gonna keep it and I don't really have any more like contouring color to
9:12contour my nose because i don't want to turn the fucking weird so this is what
9:15we're going to keep it to be a base at I like dr. now I feel like at this face
9:18looks nice as clean it looks pretty
9:21so we're going to go on to the eyes now the first things first we're going with
9:25the brows because the brows are pretty bad right now to grab products that have
9:29actually been using for a while
9:31now that things are going to mesh well together this but i just want to show
9:34you guys what they are
9:34I've been using the Maybelline brow drama crayon because i do have browser
9:38so i don't really need to do a lot of things I just kind of feel the min ago
9:40and the loreal brow stylist plumper which is such a good brow gel its to see
9:45amazing
9:46so I use the Maybelline thing I literally just right through my brow
9:48like this on the areas i have more sparseness this is in the shade and
9:53don't know
9:54and down on the darkest one and we're just going to push that through the brow
9:58anyone have any sparseness as you can see like all right just looks a lot more
10:02filled nice bar so that's kind of what i'm doing i was running through with
10:05this nice big ol crayon
10:07I was going to run a quick believe through my brother though because it is
10:10pretty harsh and then the loreal brow stylist plumper going to run that little
10:15bridge also this is a really good freakin browser for the from the
10:17drugstore it's honestly like impressive like I was genuinely impressed i first
10:21tried this I was a day
10:23ok and you give a little bit of color excuse me no real excuse the fucking
10:28edge and then I'm going to clean them up with a little bit of concealer
10:31underneath them to give them more of a sharper appearance and that's it for the
10:35out
10:35huh so I just found my Milania Luminoso blush really quickly let me just apply
10:40that because that's like my favorite drugstore blush of all time is just such
10:44a
10:44mmm mmm it's so beautiful and so bad now we're going to win the eyes and by the
10:51way are primed the eyes off of camera using Maybelline master concealers
10:55primer also clean up the brows as well just so I can have a base down
10:59first things first with the eyes i'm going with the mix single shadow in the
11:02shade so wait i use in my first short story i believe just a nice neutral
11:06transition shade on a more 5027 i'm just going to go into the crease just have a
11:12base color down first idea what I want to do with the eyes
11:14I don't want to be like that everyday average I don't want to be slightly more
11:18dramatic
11:18so this is a nice really neutral buildable maple brown and i love it
11:22the battery got all that drama computer
11:24that transfer shit so that is why the computers on and now i'm going with my
11:29favorite favorite drugstore shadow formula of all time it is the Loreal
11:35infallible shadows
11:36after i tried the amber rush color and I did my last tutorial i went out about
11:40three but because I was like you gotta be joking me because they're so good
11:45so now I'm going today with the shade and bronze taupe such a beautiful creamy
11:48buttery consistency
11:50it's literally like a foil shadow from the drugstore its ID
11:54I don't know how well did it's just such a beautiful consistency and I was going
11:58to go on top of my lid just put this nice bronzy taupe color on the lid with
12:02your finger suck
12:04come on come on I'm shaking this little cleanup morphe brush which is the e28
12:09letting out the edges so there's no hard lines
12:13how do we know what I want to do like I just like feel like I'm in like this
12:15weird like I just want to know everything
12:18great now we have this is just told me top of the high part i want to go on
12:22with this next white liquid liner
12:24I just kind of wanted to try doing more of a cool different liner
12:28I want this look to be different I feel like I've been kind of inner not enough
12:31fun but i feel like i've been really into like pinks and neutrals recently so
12:35I just want to kind of jump out of my comfort zone and do something that's
12:37more fun and so we're going with this when the good liner and create a wing
12:41with it
12:45and fill it in so now we have the white eyeliner on
12:49I felt like it looks a little bit weird I think it was kind of a naked mole rap
12:53but it's because my eyeliner on and you're not emphasizing the last year so
12:58what you put lashes on it'll be so much better
13:00so the liquid liner by NYX you definitely like pile that one on the too
13:04late to three layers because it's not when it dries it's not as pigmented as a
13:07first goes onstage need to be aware of that and kind of cracks a little bit as
13:10well so just be aware that but I don't think it turned out really nicely
13:15honestly like I wanted something more bold look on the lower lash line so I'm
13:18going to take the next bot pop palette the switch chartreuse color and this man
13:22color is coming speaking to me so I want to use those who break them into this
13:26looks somehow somebody taking first Lee this shade right here on a just big
13:31fluffy brush this is an 18 more feet that's it on the lower lash line on the
13:34outside
13:35is that a pop of color like this though it's pretty so I'm going with this like
13:39really bright chartreuse color on the inner third of that I just to give it
13:43more of a bright like ombre effect it look pretty cool
13:45so don't take the next train surely liner in the shade black and I'm up with
13:49that on the water line gives you an idea or bright colors because i like to
13:51emphasize my lower lash line with a black eyeliner but I want my ice to get
13:55lost in like the white eyeliner or the color so that's kinda what i'm doing ok
13:59like this so far
14:00I'm doing in there and when you're doing a white eyeliner I feel like it's very
14:04very very important to put on lashes because you want to really define the
14:08lash line that it's going to kind of like kind of crazy have you been driving
14:11my real lashes for some falsies later on
14:13so from a scale already taking the Maybelline lash sensational mascara
14:16I've heard really really really great things about this one so I went out and
14:19body and it kind of reminds me of the roller lash benefit like applicator it
14:23looks looks similar to that play that on the lashes
14:26we have a mascara on now I'm not really sure if I like this one for the bottom
14:29lashes
14:30I feel like I was really do too much for me down there is any suggestions for a
14:34really good bottom lashline mascara from the drugstore
14:37let us know down there so now we're going with the lashes i'm going to take
14:40the lashes at serengeti my new found something that just give me a nice
14:43flared outlook and this is what you should have so far
14:45now tell me doesn't it with lashes look so much more natural and like it goes so
14:50much better together
14:51that's all I'm saying I'm telling you guys the lashes really make a huge
14:54difference at least emphasizing your own
14:56natural lashes when you're doing white liner and your lash lengthening and lost
14:59really really easily and your allies in general just get lost so with wearing
15:02lashes it's a really important part about this look this is what the little
15:05turn out to be and I think it turned out awesome huh
15:07millions of you guys in to see what that looks like up close
15:14so we have that face and we have the is done let's go ahead and finish off with
15:20the lippy or fat lips I'm gonna be taking the next week of the neutral lip
15:24liner
15:24this is a little heat huh it's embarrassing how much I've used this
15:28embarrassing if you guys have followed me since like the OG days back in the
15:32day you guys know makes people neutral lip liner I still use it like everyday
15:38it's just such a pretty neutral baby pink lip liner that works so well with
15:44any new lipstick and he knew anything i just love it perfect so we are not
15:48flying to perfection so now let's go in with a lipstick i honestly don't even
15:51know what I want to go into I want more
15:53no more peach I want to go I don't it's obviously got a bunch of the kate
15:58lipsticks by Rimmel London and I literally love this formula so much
16:02such a creamy beautiful consistency it's not like super opaque where it's like
16:05family crazy pigment right away
16:07it's just a really pretty creamy formula that I mean it sounds a lot of color to
16:11it but it's not like a mattifying lips it whatsoever it's a cream
16:14this is the shade 42 and i've been wearing this like crazy this month
16:18look at that look at that and it's not so good like I don't even know what this
16:24morning just want to go to me and this is the final look

5:28they actually kill it with concealers
5:29and they just looking slim my whole life
5:32the fit me is a little more than a
5:34medium coverage concealer and the master
5:36and feels like a full pass coverage like
5:38heavy-duty bitch so I'm just going to
5:40mix them both hit me first pitch that
5:43motherfucker and then taking a very
5:44small amount as you can see right there
5:45a very small amount of the master
5:47concealed that glam large 1 i'm going
5:50with that right closest to where I have
5:52the dark circles in the dark color that
5:55right there just to help really bright
5:57and conceal ok let's go ahead and take
5:59real titties brunch brush and sponge
6:04combined is brunch at
6:05apparently in my mind
6:10chuckles and now we're going to take
6:11that same real techniques sponge and
6:12blend that in really pounce those bad
6:15boys together to make like a nice custom
6:17coverage nice full coverage is still
6:19very brightening and really pretty as

6:24bitch we are not looking like fucking
6:26affordable today we're going to look
6:27expensive
6:28after that you're gonna have to pay a
6:29lot for rent on the hook so now i'm
6:32going to take the RCA and no color
6:34powder this one is not really found out
6:36the drugstore but it's not very
6:37expensive it's like 13 bucks
6:38it's a very very very good inexpensive
6:40option for a great powder to set the
6:43face i'm used to bake underneath my
6:44highest taking on the world techniques
6:46sponge and just pressing that in a
6:48really ensuring a nice full coverage set
6:52well honey you know we are beautiful

7:05hey I feel like a little kid some for
7:09the rest of things i'm gonna take me
7:10cody Eric spun powder this is found at
7:12most drugstores is literally like five
7:14dollars is absolutely amazing i remember
7:17the first time I ever saw cody is when I
7:18was watching a drag queen tutorial on
7:20youtube because i wanted to i had tried
7:23to drag before i got into makeup guy
7:24just letting you know it's such a random
7:26backstory
7:27I tried doing drag want with some
7:28friends and i will subtract tutorials
7:31and it was just it was not cute
7:34my look was not cute I'll try to find
7:36photos and insert them but I don't
7:38you're welcome because it's not going to
7:40be good so I put down our teeth brush
7:41and just press that in all over the face
7:43this powder smells like your grandma's
7:45room if you guys are wondering what this
7:47probably smells like it's insane
7:49I like the laura mercier translucent
7:50much more but if you're on a budget and
7:53you want something that's kind of
7:53similar and comparable the Cody our
7:57spine will be fantastic
7:58so now that i'm done pretty much cooking
8:00underneath these eyes looking pretty
8:02soon I'm gonna take the maybelline fit
8:05me powder in the shade 110 is like one
8:07of their lighter shades and I just that
8:09underneath the iso wipe off any of the
8:11excess powder and it's just gonna help
8:13to wipe off everything as well as kind
8:14of also brighten and then
8:15my eyes this is a face powder that gives
8:18you like a little bit of a face shine
8:20bitches struggling ok cool so now that
8:25our faces pretty much set the one thing

8:32the Loreal infallible Pro matte powder
8:35in the shade 300 which is the same shade
8:36that I use for the liquid and I justice
8:39all over the face just to kind of give
8:40me more of a skin-like appearance again
8:42to help dust off the excess Cody are
8:44spun powder that's not gonna make a big
8:46difference but it is more of a personal
8:47preference thing you can just leave it
8:49as is with the corresponding but i

12:37eyebrows on camera I usually do browse
12:39off of camera but i decided that because
12:40i am doing more drugstore look /
12:43affordable stuff i'm going to the browns
12:44on camera at least one maybe house off
12:46the camera though I did contour my nose
12:47a little bit with that same of butter
12:49bronzer gets my nose looks slightly
12:51smaller or whatever the fuck it looked
12:52you look bigger look smaller
12:54I don't know so now for the brow i'm
12:57going to be taking a pee
12:59loreal brow stylist definer which looks
13:02basically like it'd be a little honest
13:03arrow is adorable and we're going to be
13:06trying this out what she's this shade of
13:09dark brunette we're gonna be creating
13:11our little brow shape just like I
13:12normally would but any other provinces
13:14bottom of the brown first
13:16hey pretty good that's what is
13:18definitely pigment and you can see that
13:20i created a little button shape the rest
13:22of my brown that's too long
13:24honesty is not bad at all does not that
13:26at all to me how long does it last on
13:28the Browse off the day I have no idea
13:30i'm only doing this right now back into
13:32safe right now the experience that this
13:33goes on my sleeve pigment in its really
13:35really easy which I love and yeah it's
13:38not too bad
13:39let's go into our on the eyes now I'm
13:41primed on the eyes the only thing i will
13:42guys not affordable in this video entire
13:44video is the primary that i'm wearing on
13:46my eyes it's the Smashbox 24-hour when
13:48it comes to prime around the eyes that's
13:49like the one thing I'll not forfeit for
13:51like a lower-end one I just think that
13:53that one is the best and i can't really
13:56stop using it because i'm scared i want
13:57another one that was good you know so
13:59I'm decided that today I want to do a
14:01really cool purple focused look a
14:04dramatic one so I grabbed the morphe 35o
14:06palette which is the 35 per pod this is
14:09going to be great because it has
14:10literally every purple fucking shady i
14:12need ever and i want to focus everything
14:15on the lid color which is the infallible
14:17shadowed by L'Oreal and smoldering plum
14:19so we're going to be doing something on
14:21that lets go and start on with this I
14:23gonna be taking this transition shade or
14:25right here like a nice basically like
14:27peach smoothie looking transition in
14:29this is not anymore 5027 working with
14:31that into the crease very lightly and
14:34just press that in and just using little
14:36nice round circular motions to blend
14:38everything together the same our
14:39transition shade you guys on my status
14:41before about more people say it again
14:43some of these shades are a serious like
14:46bangers like they're so absolutely
14:47easy especially for the price . but some
14:49of them don't work as immediately as
14:51some other ones do so just understand
14:53you guys know that some of them off n
14:54nominal and some of them are good
14:56that's number one ok so just let you
14:59guys know I mean for modesty for a pilot
15:00for like what 25 bucks
15:02hey hold full palette that works very
15:04well trademarks that's pretty amazing to
15:06me i think so if you're looking for a
15:08nice pop and you look purple check out
15:10the 35 p because it works very well and
15:12it does have every clearly could
15:13possibly need as well as the nice
15:14transitions that you want in a pallet or
15:17just if you want a transition in general
15:18so I'm going with more precise brush the
15:20morphe e17 and that's going to go more
15:23concentrated into the crease really
15:25watching building that color up as
15:27another transition right on top of the
15:29new tape Casey right there two beautiful
15:31two beautiful color
15:33we're gonna take that out because we are
15:34going to be pretty dramatic with this
15:35look right there is no denying the fact
15:39that Moore has a good shadows like
15:40there's no denying it I don't you try
15:42talking about morphine say like it's
15:43chunky were at the end of the day you
15:45can literally swatch it put on your eyes
15:47and you'll see that they work if you
15:49know what you're doing the work
15:51no tea no shade to other shit talkers
15:52that can use my favorite shows your hand
15:55yeah i guess i'm just going in without
15:57you 27 and blending out those shades ok
16:01course we have a nice dusty pinkish
16:03purple thing going on right now let's go
16:05and focus on much more brighter purple
16:07and start to really build up that
16:08intensity ok now let's go in for even
16:11cooking without notice and reboot I'm
16:13thinking we're going to go in with this
16:15shade and this shade combine these two
16:17here and we're going to go ahead and
16:18start to the same thing built up that
16:20people into the crease nice just like
16:22dusty rose kind of thing going on but I
16:23really want to make sure that we have
16:24this purple moment going on because this
16:26look is going to be mostly purple this
16:28is a really cool to look for me it's a
16:29different okay fine whatever that
16:31actually lower than the other shades
16:33because this is going to be a great
16:34effect and blend out the 27 once more
16:36people so now i'm going to take a 36
16:39brush my morphine I'm gonna take this
16:40really pretty
16:41maroon burgundy shade right here it's a
16:43little darker it's much more warmer
16:45maroon brownish shade up with that
16:47lowest of all the colors and really
16:49start to build that up as well because
16:51i'm going to do a really dark lid i feel
16:53so I'm going to really make sure that it
16:54looks intense all the way over
16:56$OPERAND minutes and it's able to blend
16:57in easily into the next shades going up
16:59you can see I'm building right here and
17:01I'm really just looking up while doing
17:03this so i can see exactly where I want
17:05to place the product as you can see it's
17:08already starting to dig deep and darken
17:09up nicely same 317 blend out those edges
17:13again between each step I take that you
17:1517 and blend out one more time and now
17:17for the fun part we're going to go ahead
17:19and put on the lid color i'm taking a
17:22Maybelline 24-hour tattoo crayon and
17:25this is a lilac dust shade everybody
17:28going over with the Laurel shot on top
17:29just press it in i think this is would
17:31be a nice base color it is going to be a
17:33little bit lighter than the shadow or go
17:35in with but i don't know i just want I
17:37just saw it and I thought it would be
17:38nice for a base somewhere that crayon
17:41all over the lid wherever it is exposed
17:44and really have a nice pretty color down
17:47that's beautiful and i'm taking a more
17:495032 and blending out cream so it's not
17:52as intense looking it's not so like a
17:54line basically ok cool so now it's going
17:57to apply this L'Oreal infallible
17:58eyeshadow and shape smoldering plum this
18:00is the morbid dark shade it's almost
18:02black with like purple reflect on it
18:04waiting on a 32 my morphe same brush we
18:07just used to blend out those edges are
18:08just going to pack that on right on top
18:10of the base was a beautiful and it's
18:13really just start to build slowly and
18:15pat on so there's no major fallout
18:17smoking is not playing any games cause i
18:21love the color packed on exactly where
18:23we want it to we're gonna go ahead and
18:24blend out the edges of that color with
18:26that statement 36 you don't have any
18:28additional product we're just going to
18:29blend out that little harsh lion there's
18:32no harsh lines or any edges for this
18:35look we want to look really seamless and

19:13because it's really easy for I to look
19:15so closed off you know I'm saying
19:17quickest what it looks like nice and
19:18highlight did start to build up the
19:21color on the lower lash line like I did
19:22on the top something that nice arose
19:24that pedal shade right here i want to
19:26put that on the lower lash line to see
19:29if there's any of the darker shades left
19:30on this precious all good because you're
19:32really going to building up darker
19:33shades anyway so she does really matter
19:34so now going back in with a vibrant
19:36purple shade right there i'm going to be
19:38taking that money more 5043 really start
19:40to build up the intensity on the lower
19:42lash line and make that really cool
19:44purple pot this look is fantastic of you
19:47have green eyes blue eyes any kind of
19:49colored eyes even brown eyes this is
19:50such a pretty look it's gonna really
19:52complement so many different kind of eye
19:54colors i just love it so much
19:56so when that really bright purple all
19:58the way in right story but the highlight
20:00because it is gonna be smoking all the
20:01way around now to really make sure
20:02everything is intense and smoky still
20:05we're going to take that darkest shade
20:06right here i'm going to put that closest
20:10to the lash line and really start to
20:12define the lower lashline really well to
20:14make sure it's really close to the lash
20:15line really pushing that in because of
20:19course closest election at the top is
20:21really dark as well and we're going to
20:22blend out with that you 36 make sure it
20:25doesn't look too hard place and now we
20:26have that down the go ahead and line up
20:28the waterline with this pencil by
20:30Maybelline is the Maybelline New York
20:31lasting and drama waterproof gel pencil
20:33in the shade polished em amethyst what
20:36the fuck in the shade and polish
20:38amethyst yeah so i'm going to put that
20:39on my waterline and just go ahead and
20:42brighten everything up because this is
20:44very bright intense looking for i think
20:46i'm attorney let's trade
20:47oh I just feel like because we are doing
20:49a purple look I wanted to keep it in
20:50that purple family that's pretty that's
20:52really pretty
20:53because I now we're gonna play some
20:54mascara advertisement for this is the
20:56new maybelline the falsies push-up angel
20:59then general oh this is very confusing
21:03doesn't want to see this
21:06okay well we're gonna try to help ok
21:08those lashes okay honestly I'm not mad
21:16this mascara at all
21:17it works pretty freaking well I have
21:19really bad lashes guide
21:20I i have laughed at that point straight
21:21down the short it's just not a cute look
21:24at this one I feel like because this the
21:26one is so tiny it really did help
21:28separate my lashes and push them upwards
21:30and notice a difference for real because
21:34you there was another mascara
21:35automatically apply some falsies I
21:37grabbed from I lower the vegas name
21:39lashes i got these at ulta and I figured
21:43I was gonna do a lash it's not as
21:44expensive as last night usually where i
21:46always wear like me glasses that are
21:47just a nice intense wispy pair but this
21:49is a great lash for not too much things
21:52like seven bucks and so we're gonna play
21:53the / on his eyes and that is it for the
21:57final i love this is what they look like
21:59what the lashes on things now that we
22:01have the face and the eyes completed i'm
22:04gonna go ahead and do the lips real
22:05quick and of course we're going to be
22:06taking a more affordable option lipstick
22:08as well so because my eye is really
22:11purple it's literally just you know it's
22:13purple right away i was going to go with
22:14the neutral and just keep it nude and
22:16move on but i really want to switch up
22:17the look and touch come out of my
22:19comfort zone a little bit and put a more
22:21dark nude on the lips
22:23so what I decided to go with his
22:24kathleenlights is at point zero lipstick
22:26also satin lip with color pop I've done
22:29this before and i love it so much it's a
22:31beautiful shape i think with this look
22:33going on it's neutral enough to work but
22:35it's still like not a nude as much if
22:38that makes any sense
22:39so we go ahead and apply this on the EDX
22:41I'm so cool tones like the coolest ever
22:43been and this is the final look and that

0:22as well i'm doing a series on my channel where I'm doing one brand tutorial i'm
0:25doing an entire look on just that one brand and I think it's been going really
0:29well so far and i love it and i think this will come out really really nice
0:32and it's all Kat Von D and kevin is one of my favorite brands like that is so
0:36that's before I think it's so awesome I think it's really cost efficient it's
0:39not super super super expensive but it's also really high quality but yeah this
0:42is what they came up with this is like a router smokey eye with a nice bold coral
0:47pink lip and I think about really nice is a great look for spring or summer
0:51you want to feel it a little more on the bold side but still wanted to be like
0:54still like glue and spring and summer mean you know Sam
0:57yeah that's what kind of video do not fucking watch it but yeah other than
1:03that I'll get you guys to the tutorial and I will catch you in my next video
1:07that's not true no see you guys soon
1:12okay okay so we're gonna start on to see all that yeah I don't know what that is
1:15or some other clean face
1:17i re-watched and I moisturize so we're good to go so it's going to head
1:21yeah i'm gonna start with the kat von d lock-it featherweight primer
1:25this is a water-based primer it is extremely like liquidy
1:29I've used it once before and it wasn't like anything amazing i wasn't like
1:33super shocked and amazed by it but it does feel super nice on the skin and now
1:41we're going to take the kat von d block information and the shape 48 light
1:45I think this is my color shape is literally shellac is fucking will go
1:53virtual my god it's really intense
1:55so I'm gonna take a little bit my finger is going to Pat it i'm going to be using
1:58a beauty blender with us because this is a very full coverage mattifying
2:02foundation and I want to share it out maybe slightly I don't want to look like
2:05Sherlock on my face
2:06I don't want to look too cakey and I think using a beauty blender with this
2:10foundation specifically really really really makes a huge huge difference
2:15huge difference to use the beauty wonder if it doesn't load it slightly
2:19not too much but like very slightly diluted it is full coverage
2:23this is not coffee face like if you were to put this bitch on it is not coming
2:27off your finger this is an amazing foundation for like an event or if
2:30you're going out like to the club and you get oily
2:33oh my god this bitch is not coming up even if you like dancing you're fucking
2:36booty popping and like grinding on some homes like this shit is not leaving
2:40literally take a little bit of ears on your neck a little bit i don't have it
2:44he how to hurt someone you can take this shit down my neck and I'm going to take
2:48the locket a concealer and light 16 which i think is the lightest color
2:52going to be a very tiny amount and i'm going to Pat it where I have the most
2:55amount of darkness and bring it out and then right away i'm going with the
2:59Beauty Blender
3:00this is a full-coverage concealer so you really really really want to go in quick
3:04to blend it out and to set it because it will increase if you do not set it will
3:08take a little bit on the lids two of two prime for the shadows are going with
3:11option to set it right away quickly and i'm going to be
3:13Kat Von D shade light with my favorite powder contour and highlight
3:19it of all time I'm take the light and shade on a more fee and 438 you guys
3:25know this better than an obsession
3:27I'm just set the under eye with it right away I like to just set it right away
3:30i'm not going to do the other eye was can see the first
3:32i'm setting the fish first and my life as well and then we'll go in with you
3:37can see that on the other side
3:38conceal conceal don't feel i just realized i lost and eat my earring
3:47holy shit
3:50ok problem partially solved that were concealed when you go back in with a
3:55more the g7 and the shade light palette we're gonna take that middle in the
3:59middle seen worse things that to bronze up to face i love this metal shape color
4:03because it's beautiful warm terracotta color like this foundation dries to a
4:06matte finish so you don't need to worry about like sitting at you really don't
4:10it's pretty sick that want to our car color and just blend into the skin it's
4:15so you have all the same thing on the cheeks have went a little heavy handed
4:23as you can see the palate is very pigmented i am absolutely obsessed
4:26yeah problems are gonna take a whiter shade when I put it in the center of the
4:30forehead to bring a little bit of lightness to the face in the center
4:33now i'm gonna take my makeup geek rounded blush brush and the
4:38he this shit right here is my favorite contouring brush you can take that at
4:41the base of my ear talking about your down to start bluffing bluffing that in
4:45and just really start buffing that into the skin
4:49it's a little more cool tone than the terracotta color that we were here first
4:51so yeah so yeah a little bit of the temples as well just give you a little
4:57bit more of a dainty full head which looks to me like this
5:01pretty easy huh so now i have a base down I'm gonna go into the eyes right
5:04now I'm actually gonna do my brows off camera because i don't think anybody has
5:07brow products yet so i'm going to quickly do eyebrows off camera and then
5:10i'll go into the eyes
5:11it is time for the I so i'm going to go ahead and take the monarch eyeshadow
5:15palette the orange one
5:16I cannot be obviously cases in the cavity to the ground you know this is
5:19just like my obsession of her pallets like this is one of my all-time favorite
5:23once I think it's so beautiful and so Universal interesting a little
5:26comfortable routine going to go ahead and we're going to look at that we're
5:29going to just take the bone china know what is that all over the brow bone area
5:33as well as the lid and she's going to kind of help highlight the brow bone as
5:37well as give us a kind of like a nice little base to start with you know and
5:40that i'm just doing that on a little more p.m.
5:42- oh nice going to get more fit for three and i'm gonna take that nice
5:45bright ask operate orange color is just a very small amount because the shadows
5:49are still think there's a little that I was gonna run in the crease very fucking
5:54lightly put this shit is orange and I really want to keep it focused on the
5:58outer corner that are left on the brush running it lightly in the crease and get
6:02out of the way and I'm gonna go into a sigma e40 and blend that out even more
6:07oh they blend so nicely to handle one today
6:11yeah it's looking pretty fucking easy I'm going to get a nice chocolate brown
6:15shade on the same for 33 and I'm gonna run that on the outer corner lower than
6:19I have that Warren chain
6:20I'm not just going to go into our lash line almost as well in our crease I'm
6:24sure to make a copy and outer V with this
6:26you want to be too neat i kinda wanted to be a little bit smoky and messy and
6:30i'm just going to take that and 43 and just go over the brown and the orange
6:34again with no additional product i'm just literally blending the two together
6:38p for t sigma and not
6:40again that's not going to take a sigma e30 pencil brush and that black shade
6:45the slightest amount of it because it is so pigmented like bitch I say this to
6:50maintain and i'm just going to roughly run it into the ground as well making a
6:55cute little V and then take a clean brush any commercial work i'm taking
6:59morphine 441 and blend all that together about the item me nice and neutral but
7:04still with a little pop of orange and warmth to it and she looks like this
7:07very neutral kind of outer smokey eye going on
7:11grab any kind of packing brush them to take this one by sophie and then I'm
7:14going to grab that same bone banana shade and you can take that on the lid
7:18the mobile is just going to help contour the I slightly and just bring some
7:21weight back into it like me
7:24so now i'm going to a wing we're going to take the trooper Kat Von D tattoo
7:28liner one of my favorite lines like ever
7:30it's so good it's so sharp you can do the most amazing with these and I is
7:34loveth
7:42boom swing down
7:46e so now we're going to get back into that palette for the bottom of the lash
7:49line
7:49take a little bit of the orange shade very little and mix it in with the
7:54chocolate brown we're gonna run that underneath the lash line close to the
7:57lash line and we don't want to be too into intense but i do want a little bit
8:00of definition down here and slightly further forward vary slightly but I want
8:03to most the most definition beyond the outer corner and then blend that out the
8:07little more food pencil brush very slightly
8:10so now i'm going to the other eye off camera as well as chrome eyelashes and I
8:13shall be right but ok good i brought my room down to several degrees and while i
8:19was in my other eye so thank goodness my eyes look like it's like an outer smokey
8:23eye or ng warmth
8:25you know my shit okay I'm going to go and apply some mascara now we're going
8:29to take the immortal lashed by Kat Von D I've actually never tried this message
8:32here before so it's trina everything else I've tried but not dangerous
8:36the one is fucking crazy shit is huge and notice right away is that it makes
8:41my lashes really skinny but it makes them really dark too so it's good to me
8:45that important to me because I apply false lashes anyway I just wish that it
8:47made my lashes a lot thicker like they're like benefit roller lash i
8:50really love that mascara but this one coat the bottom lashes tune carefully
8:55this bitch is so big like if you're into those huge ass once you're gonna be
9:00obsessed like you're gonna love this bitch but I like smaller ones for me
9:04because I'm just not careful with under I like I'm just gonna hire
9:08there we go mascara is on I'm sweating a damn
9:13so I'm going to take thinking of you lashes and style number one who has no
9:15style number one licking your lashes they just make me so weak they just make
9:21me so weak like they're just so beyond amazing
9:24not even kidding i'm like i'm worn these lashes like literally
9:28ten times don't give up on me a bitch to not give up on me yet I'm not ready
9:33perfect the lashes are on and the eyes are done something going to be guys in
9:36to see what the thighs look like up close
9:39gah me like to finish off the face ok so i do not have any blush when come on di
9:49know they have blushes
9:50I just forgot to go out and get one so we're gonna go ahead and take this
9:53second
9:54peachy pink gold color on aid morphy g5 organs ass blush loaded carefully
10:00because their shadows next to it
10:02ok no we're not gonna use that brush or going to use a more 509 which is like a
10:07tapered brush brush essentially and i'm going to load the brush up
10:11it's so pretty good pretty golden pink and why not use Shadow has a fucking
10:17flesh why not
10:17who said again i think im using his blush and highlight because it does like
10:21a machine
10:21I may or may not have gotten some of the great on my face that's what you get
10:24when you are trying to be resourceful and use a shadow as bullish but whatever
10:29it's not even that was also a lot
10:31we're almost done you guys will have lips left so I decided because I is kind
10:35of spooky but it's so more on the natural smoky side like it's not like
10:37freaking black everywhere you know i'm going to go ahead and take the jet free
10:41liquid lipstick
10:42it's just beautiful hot pink coral blue
10:48I hate / drawing with just enough of applicator and not having like a lip
10:52liner but I don't think happened he has a waiter at this bitch and ride on my
10:55lips like this color is still perfect for summer and spring it's like the most

2:29that's going to increase area a little bit lower than our transitions that we
2:40have a nice little transition color we have a little purple that's crazy but
2:43it's a little-known I am so now we got more feet and 43 just like my favorite
2:47morphe brush of all time and then we're going to go ahead and just go we're
2:53gonna just go in with this color right here and that's when go into our lower
2:56crease and its really blend it into the crease nice and softly keeping your eyes
3:03open for this you can see where you want the color to be deposited are going to
3:07get all the way in now going with e-40 again and just blend away any edges that
3:11I might not like with no additional product at all
3:15so now we're going with the fun part we're going to go in with bombshell
3:20which is this dark purple Clary hear that same morphe brush just get a good
3:26amount on like that that's off the excess and now we're going to place into
3:30our crease we're gonna put that in our outer corner first and then we're going
3:35to put into our crease and this is busy going to be our outline for smokey eye
3:40so we're going to go into the crease and outer corner right over that previous
3:45color
3:48then we go back in with a 40 and blend away the harsh like you can see a little
3:53harsh edge between my transition in the purple you want that to be almost
3:57completely diffused so now we're gonna go in with a morphine 320 any flat brush
4:06will work totally fine and then we're going with that bombshell color again
4:09right here loaded in and now we're going to hurry back on eyelid more densely
4:18towards the lash line and then we're getting up to the transition color I'm
4:21going a little bit softer that mytouch is a little bit softer because I want to
4:25be more diffused the higher we go
4:28so then we're gonna go ahead and grab that same morphine for 33 and with no
4:32additional product and blend the edges where my late color meets the transition
4:37color should look something like this so I'm gonna go in with a black eyeliner
4:42I'm going in with the LA girl very black eyeliner and that we're just focusing on
4:46the inner corner or in a room of our I smoking stock and then we're gonna go
4:52back in with that deep dark plum color on a sigma e 15 which is like those
4:57kinda the flat shader brushes and that we're gonna run by lash line very close
5:04to the lash line
5:07so now we're going to go back in to the palate we're going to dip into let me
5:12get a different 2 free spirit claret here and the one next to it and then
5:18we're gonna blend underneath that deep dark purple same brush we're going to go
5:23in with the lightest color and go underneath that
5:28yeah not so panicky like the last one huh like that we have this nice dark
5:34deep purple smokey and then just go and tell us a little bit more of the light
5:39color right here

7:54I love you guys comments us know that you guys on my next video
0:00hey guys welcome back to mastering the art of today we're going to talk about
0:04you guessed it
0:05cushion compact everything you need to know about which is the best cushion to
0:09look for the best color for your skin type and the best techniques have fun
0:12and of course good luck don't worry if you're new to cushion compacts
0:17here's a quick one on one they originated from Korea and normally they
0:20provide a lightweight sheer coverage the packaging as you can see here is bulkier
0:24than your average compact because it has to create an airtight seal to keep your
0:29cushion fresh
0:30if you look inside you'll find an applicator which is usually a dense
0:33antibacterial circular sponge like this in a porous sponge that soaks in
0:38foundation BB or CC cream
0:40here's my favorite pro tip just like how you're flipping the matches to turn the
0:44bed
0:44flip the sponge when the product starts to run low it's kind of like go on up
0:48for the sponge
0:49the application is pretty universal all you have to do is load the applicator
0:53sponge and start blogging onto the skin in small even paths
0:57choosing the right cushion compact all comes down to selecting the right finish
1:00and coverage for your skin tone and type if you have fair skin then you know the
1:05struggle of finding product that matches your complexion
1:08when I say fair I mean skin that is paler than a ghost
1:12so pale that your face is naturally blown out in flash photos but it's all
1:16good because those of you with fair skin have a decent range of brands to choose
1:19from many of my favorites are from South Korea
1:24if you have a light to medium 10 skin town you have a lot of options to play
1:28with a lot of the Korean brands will carry only a few shades that generally
1:33fall in the light to medium skin tones
1:35here are some of my favorite brands to check out
1:38because cushion compact is relatively new and face makeup
1:42unfortunately shade range is limited but there are brands who carry shades for
1:48deeper tones cushions are also available in color correction shade yellow helps
1:53with discoloration purple combats dullness peach brightens dark circles
1:57and green neutralizes redness
2:00now we can move on to recommendations for different skin types when selecting
2:04the cushion compact for dry skin instead of finding one that is foundation based
2:08look for one that is BB or CC cream based for application use a good
2:12moisturizer and hydrating primer
2:14you can even spray a moisturizing toner on your application sponge before
2:18applying in order to keep your skin hydrated and the foundation from
2:22settling into fine lines from here
2:24just continue building your desired coverage by adding thin layers i
2:28recommend pressing and lifting like this to avoid streaks and dry patches here
2:32are some of my pics for dry skin
2:35when it comes to selecting the cushion compact for combination skin you have a
2:40wider range to choose from since you can tolerate compacts for dry and oily skin
2:44for application
2:45start by applying your cushion compact around your jawline and cheeks building
2:49coverage as you go from there
2:51damn around the t-zone area with the Beauty Blender in order to avoid build
2:55up and once you're done immediately set this area with powder for a flawless
2:59finish
3:00here are some bread that you can try out for combination skin
3:04if you have oily skin be aware that cushion compact are not the best choice
3:08because of their duty finishes
3:10no worries though there are cushion compact for you just try and find one
3:14that has a mattifying or satin finish
3:16stay away from the ones with hydrating benefits and look for one that has a
3:19lightweight formula when it comes to application
3:22start by using your favorite mattifying prime something like milk of magnesia
3:26that will soak up the oil on your t-zone and keep him at throughout the day after
3:30building your desired coverage finish off with a mattifying spray and apply
3:34translucent or mattifying powder to keep your skin looking fresh
3:38here are my recommendations for oily skin both acne in mature skin are
3:44grouped together here because both types require extra attention
3:47the trick is to keep your skin balance you want to look for cushion compacts
3:51with added skincare benefits and stay away from heavy formulas with harsher
3:55ingredients for application start with the primer to help smooth out fine lines
4:00or blemishes
4:01from here you can apply with a damp sponge to avoid excess product in fine
4:05lines be sure that you're applying in thin layers because most of the formulas
4:09are sheer you may have to touch up with a spot concealer unblemished areas
4:15yeah
4:15once you're done with the application finish off the hydrating setting missed
4:19and here are some brand recommendations
4:24oh and special thanks to everyone who was in this video we decided to show up

1:18dark lip color

1:43minimal arch this will give me a more sophisticated look

1:20smooth it out
1:22now it's time to conceal any blemishes and dark circles
1:27usually I like to use a fluffy contour brush to apply my concealer on this way
1:31it actually creates a beautiful airbrush finish
1:35so start around the eyes and move out to the rest of the face to even it out
1:39ok
1:42and don't forget to powder up to keep your makeup lasting all into the night

1:15and now you're kpop is done and now that your eyes are dying
1:19it's time to show your face in love you want to start off by using BB cream

1:26combination of tinted moisturizer
1:28Sarah and primer k-pop stars are all about perfecting the skin so it's
1:33important to create a flawless face here i'm going to use Coastal Scents
1:37concealer palette
1:38I want to cover up my dark circles which I actually got from lack of sleep
1:43make sure you're getting sleep now i'm going to highlight the rest of my face
1:48then with a sponge blend everything away

2:03attention to my eyes
2:04now take your face powder and modify your face you'll notice that i'm
2:08skipping blush and bronzer because it's actually not really needed
2:11k-pop artists usually prefer bright looking skin
2:15now for the most important step creating the famous kpop eyebrows
2:20I really love this brow look because it really reminds me about your helper you
2:24want to create folder looking brows with minimal arch the straighter the better
2:29also you don't want your brow link to be too long
2:32keep it short the full your brows and more youthful you look almost done guys
2:36time for the lips here i have three different marinus lip balm glossy
2:40lacquer stains to choose from a red rose pink and white piece
2:44these are actually colors that k-pop stars would rock I decided to choose the
2:48rose pink color
2:50remember to avoid any dark lips takes like plums deep browns and dark berries
2:54also stick with the lip finish that doesn't have any glitter or pearl
2:59texture
3:00you're finished should either have a matte glossy or satin finish
3:04when it comes to kpop fashion it's all about the accessories
3:08I decided for a glitzy look for this one and of course you can wear black
3:12but I would look for tops with interesting cutouts remember try and
3:15keep it family friendly
3:16no low-cut tops you don't want to show an evil twins if you want rocker crazy
3:21jacket look for something metallic shiny the edge here the better when it comes
3:27to hair

4:17the theme of their songs
4:22and now it's time for the guys let's turn them into kpop stars
4:27this look is actually inspired by the boy band TVXQ i would recommend going
4:31two to three shades lighter and just skip the bronzer and contouring it's not
4:35need to tear for the brows same thing straight in a little angled if his brows
4:40are super dark and jet-black try and lighten them just a bit for the eyes

4:49liner on the lower lash line when it comes to his hair keep it straight Matt

5:03public is done to really complete this look
5:06try and learn the TVXQ catch me help you
5:38you wanna know
5:55yeah
6:02have fun and good luck
6:05and don't forget to check out if see com
0:00seductive look is inspired by the lax brought to life by the flamenco dancers
0:10of Spain fierce in passionate like a row center thorns
0:15this is the spanish
0:22we all know that every great masterpiece begins with a flawless canvas
0:26let's begin by applying a lightweight CC cream which will smooth and hydrate your
0:31skin if you're looking for a sheer natural coverage cc or BB cream is the
0:37way to go
0:38just blend everything away with your clean fingers and let's move on
0:43see this concealer i made this so that you can cover up anything
0:48hence the name because BB and CC creams are so sure it might not be able to
0:53cover up dark circles or smaller skin blemishes
0:56so that's why spot treating these little imperfections with your concealer is so
1:00crucial
1:01you can either use your clean fingers or a brush to blend the concealer
1:06notice how I'm making this dabbing motion instead of dragging the brush to
1:10blend dab instead you'll notice the concealer blames faster and it's more
1:15gentle on the skin
1:19unless your foundation and concealer has a powder finish set everything with a
1:24translucent loose powder the powder will keep the makeup lasting longer anything
1:30within a Molly and texture will move increase into your fine lines and that's
1:34why powder will prevent this from happening
1:37and before moving on to the eyes just apply a little bit of attempted red lip
1:43balm which will help moisturize your lips so they're primed and ready for
1:46lipstick
1:47cool time for the fun part the eyes start with the metallic purple color on
1:53the center of the lid if you look closely the shade has many dimensions to
1:58it which will complement the other purple and gold colors that we're going
2:02to be applying later
2:05we call this dual chrome next use a shadow brush and apply a light wash of
2:11this pale lavender shade across the lids blending as you go
2:15do you see the dabbing motion again you have more control if you doubt the
2:18eyeshadow on instead of brushing it on pick up this / lavender color and accent
2:25the inner corner of the eyes
2:26this will give your eyes at hint of pastel color it's time to shadow in the
2:31bottom lashline pick up this metallic berry shade and bring the color up along
2:36the lower lash line and into the eye socket to create definition and
2:40dimension
2:41if you want a romantic smokey look build up the color intensity don't just tackle
2:47it on
2:47it's all about layering and creating a very slow buildup
2:51you'll have more control this way and just blend the contour shade so that it
2:55doesn't have a hard edge
3:05to really make your eyes appear fiery and alive
3:09take a sparkling blue shadow and gold and line the bottom lash line from the
3:13inner corner to the middle of the eye
3:15doing this will give your eyes that multifaceted look so every time you move
3:19the shadow will change with the light
3:24lastly use the light purple shadow on the brow bone which will blend away any
3:28harsh lines and create that hazy school on to effect because this look is bold
3:36and adventurous your liner should mirror that so don't be shy
3:40before beginning make sure your liner is sharpened for more precision when lining
3:46you also want to make sure that your black liner has a more creamy texture
3:50not the hard pencil one because we are going to lunge this baby up
3:55start at the outer corner of your eyes and work your way in and don't forget to
4:02line the water line to help intensify the look with the smudger brush or if
4:06you have the water liner pencil flip it over and use the smudger tool smudge the
4:10eyeliner would do so gently
4:12don't drag it on your eyes try and use a gentle patting motion keep doing it
4:17until you get this smoky effect
4:20no black eyeshadow needed just a creamy black eyeliner
4:24cool all right onto the brows I like to use to brow pencils to create my natural
4:29brow look
4:30and the reason being is because your brow hairs are made up of so many
4:33different colors and I like to keep the lighter color along the head of my brows
4:38and a darker color along the tale of my brows so fill in your brows and cover up
4:43any sparse areas
4:47honestly the brows are the most important step to any of their makeup
4:52routine so don't skip this step
4:54unless you have perfectly shaped browse lucky you
5:02now grab your mascara and go to town the more coats the better
5:06and if you need to add fake lashes we want sky-high lashes so that every time
5:11you blink
5:11it's like a gust of wind blowing away
5:15yeah
5:26now your eyes are perfect
5:31yeah
5:36to create sensual looking skin
5:40try using a skin illuminator the one that i'm using here is called golden
5:44hour
5:44so look for where the natural light hits your cheekbones and apply the
5:47illuminator around this area when it comes to creating the illusion of good
5:52skin
5:52it's all about texture and light so the more light you bring onto your face the
5:57more your club but not too much
5:59you don't want to look like a light bulb
6:03you can see how do we and healthy my skin looks now all make it my dear
6:08he had a screw an Italian art term that means light and shade and that's what
6:14we're going to be doing here
6:16use the shadow to contour the areas on your face that you want to recede
6:20I like to contour the sides of my nose to elevate it
6:23if you want to contour properly you have to find the right color and texture
6:27it has to be a neutral medium brown shade and the texture has to be Matt
6:31this will give you the most natural look
6:34once you've mapped out your face just blend wait I wanted to make sure that
6:38this formula blends effortlessly
6:40no brush or sponge needed just your warm clean fingers see how you look with
6:46subtle and intense contouring
6:49you'll never know how you look until you try and unlike contouring highlighting
6:56is when you want to make features on your face stand out so I'm gonna do this
7:01on the bridge of my nose
7:11now it's time to create your kiss of fire a bold red lip is one of the most
7:16powerful iconic beauty look that anyone can rock
7:19you just have to find the right shape that fits your undertone best or you can
7:22customize and build your own color if you have a cooler undertone find a Red
7:27that has a blue tone in it
7:28if you have a yellow undertone find a way that has a warmer toning and if
7:33you're not really sure
7:34a neutral red color is usually the safest bet you want better precision use

8:26don't forget to check out my makeup line and at em cosmetics calm and my blog
8:33updated daily at Michelle Phan com
0:00what's that majestic human
0:07I always believed how a new year is kind of like a blank canvas
0:13and I like to celebrate this idea by enhancing my favorite features the clean
0:17and fresh beauty look anyone of all ages can wear this look
0:22let's begin with a clean canvas before I attack my face of makeup
0:28I always like to start with a clean face to remove makeup residue use a makeup
0:34wipe to reveal is squeaky clean surface if you prefer using a non oil based
0:39makeup remover chlorine makes one that's enriched with corn flower extract i know
0:44not everyone has five minutes to spare
0:47but if you do show your face in love by nurturing it
0:50the deep hydrating mask stress can tire the body and it reflects on the face
0:56so finding any bit of relaxation helps and substituting a traditional
1:02moisturizer for dewy skin missed instead my favorite one by tata acts like a
1:07primer and illuminator it helps reduce any dry patches on my skin
1:11try not to neglect your lips especially if you're wearing a lot of liquid
1:16lipsticks many can be drawing so be sure to exfoliate your lips from time to time
1:21mmm this sugar lips crab tastes pretty good
1:25ok finally we can begin with makeup I like to use concealer first and spot
1:29treat any blemishes quality concealers are hard to come by when you do a little
1:34goes a long way
1:36spot treat and gently Pat like this to blend from there
1:40I like to even out the area around my nose and mouth because of excess redness
1:44moving onto the ice
1:47load up your brush with a light camel color and begin making a subtle pseudo
1:52cut crease
1:53try not to create a harsh line like a traditional countries make it feathery
1:59take a mat charcoal color loaded up with a tiny angled brush get close to your
2:05eyes
2:06notice how this gives an illusion of a thicker lash line when doing this
2:11just be sure to use a light hand with the same brush begin to feather out the
2:16darker color along your lash line sweep it out into a wing
2:20this will help elongate the shape of your eyes so from here
2:23just grab more color and begin to intensify the wing taking your time in
2:27starting lightly allows you to build up the intensity in layers now using a
2:32small eyeshadow brush loaded up with a warm earth tone shadow and begin to line
2:37the lower lash line like this
2:39I know this beauty style looks pretty simple but you'd be surprised the most
2:45simple and natural looks actually require the most time because of the
2:48blending layering and feathering and once you're done just blend it out with
2:52a fluffy brush
2:55yes there is such a thing as a sailor moon liquid eyeliner and I have to say
3:01it's one of my favorite liners
3:03i'm going to use this one over the previous eyeliner to sharpen line begin
3:08tapering out the line
3:09little by little to create a tapered . this will provide the most line control
3:14giving you the perfect wing
3:16ok let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the wraps
3:20first I'm going to use a powder to create the base for my brow shape if you
3:26wanted to look natural
3:27the powder finish should be mat from here
3:30I like to layer a pencil over creating hairlike strokes make feathery marks
3:35like so and blur the lines by combing is glee through your brows using your
3:40favorite lash curler my holy grail issues
3:43press firmly against the roots of your lashes and trying to pinch yourself
3:48keep pressing from root to tip to get the best holding curl
3:52all right now you can tight line your eyes using a warm brown eyeliner the
4:00definition it gives goes well with the color you already placed on your lower
4:04lash line
4:05now you can fuck up your lashes with generous coats of mascara
4:09I know for some people the idea of sweeping mascara through the lashes
4:13seems terrifying but honestly for me every time I swipe
4:18it's such a satisfying feeling i know im so weird
4:22so I found the best full lashes for Asian eyes they're called diamond lash
4:26and i discovered them in Tokyo
4:27first off the reason why they're so amazing is because they're super easy to
4:31peel off and I don't have to cut down the link
4:33the band is super thin and it fits perfectly for Asian eyelids
4:38BAM look how natural this looks okay once your lashes are set
4:42give them one more curl to get them all perky and excited and now you got some
4:46body lashes
4:47I like to powder when i'm almost done with the makeup because it helps
4:51maintain the freshman's look at how pretty this gradient blushes
4:59it's not your basic blush color but it's wearable watch use a brush or contour
5:04brush and sweep it back and forth to load it up with the color pop this on to
5:07your cheeks I softly blending out towards your temple
5:10all right you should be a magical now but if you're craving more dimension
5:14lightly contour use a matte neutral bronzer in the hollows of your cheeks
5:18and dust the rest around your upper hairline to balance out the face
5:22I was done finish off the look with the sultry path
5:28profit with lip liner if needed and top it off with a gradation liquid lipstick
5:36all right now you're done enjoy your body self love you
5:42good luck
5:55yeah
0:00hi need help on doing makeup for pictures
0:03no worries because i'm here to help
0:06before anything
0:10apply lip balm on your lips to get them nice and moisturized
0:18let's move on to sense came to avoid that white cast look you know when your
0:23face is white and the rest of your body is normal tone you want to use a
0:27chemical sunscreen instead of a physical sunscreen basically avoid using a
0:31sunscreen with titanium dioxide and or zinc oxide select a photo friendly
0:36foundation basically a foundation with low SPF anything below spf20 should be
0:42fine because again it won't leave your face with that white cast as you guys
0:47can see I have a little bit of redness going on my skin
0:50so I'm going to use this mint green cover stick from Maybelline what it's
0:54going to do is that it's going to neutralize the redness on my skin
0:57I know it's a little weird kind of like I'm turning myself into the Wicked Witch
1:00of the West but as you guys know green and red are complementary colors they
1:05neutralize each other out so that when you apply foundation concealer on top of
1:09the mint green color
1:10you won't see any redness
1:13yeah
1:21and as you guys can see my skin looks even to combat zombie eyes just add a
1:27little bit of concealer around your eye area with your ring finger
1:31maybe we shall try and sleep a little more if we don't want RBIs for the face
1:34i'm going to use a matte powder to set my makeup i'm going to start around my
1:38under eye area and then move towards the rest of my face
1:44kylie i know it's safe
1:48no we don't
1:49with using a white or nude matte eyeshadow loaded on your finger and make
1:54a stroke on the bridge of your nose then blend away sometimes
1:58shimmer can make your face look like it's a little oily we want to try and
2:01keep your entire makeup as mad as possible
2:04all right now it's time for eyeshadows I'm going to stick with the good old
2:07foolproof neutral eyeshadow palette you first want to use the new color as your
2:11base color apply it on your legs with a brush to clean finger
2:21next step use a matte taupe color as a contour shade and then blend away
2:27taupe is a wonderful color to use if you want to come to your eyes without making
2:31it look too happy
2:33never
2:37be
2:41now take a white eyeshadow or pencil and highlight the inner corners of your eyes
2:46this will open up your eyes more you know photograph beautifully
2:51yeah
2:53yeah
2:54take a black eye shadow and line your eyes keep the line as soft as possible
3:00who
3:08and if you want add lower lashes to create an illusion of bigger eyes
3:17so now we can layer a liquid liner on top of the soft I later that you just
3:21made
3:22keep the line as thin as possible
3:26what
3:29yeah
3:30with the eyeliner done you can now curl your lashes and get them nice and perky
3:34for mascara
3:36add as many coats of mascara as you need
3:40personally I need extra help so I'm going to use fake lashes to add more
3:44drama to my eyes find fake lashes that go with your eye shape
3:48thumbs up if you guys would like me to do a video on finding the right fake
3:51lashes for your eyes
3:52the thing about love isn't love side
3:55come
3:56we're almost done with the eyes all you have to do is just fill in your brows
4:00I decided for this look I wanted my brows to look fuller
4:03I find that when I have fuller browse I tend to look more youthful and sweet is
4:09this true human
4:12you want
4:13and don't forget to use brow gel this will keep the stray hairs in place
4:19yeah
4:19just let alone
4:21yeah
4:23I kind of like to do a little picture test around this time just to see how
4:27I'm doing and I decided to Instagram is too
4:29I noticed from the photo that my nose lacked a little bit of definition so i
4:34decided to contour it by shading the sides of my nose with a matte bronzer or
4:38taupe eyeshadow
4:43perfect and now it's time for blush and bronzer
4:49contour cheeks and add extra color to them because in flash photography
4:53it can sometimes remove twenty percent of color and intensity from your makeup
4:58usually when i'm doing makeup for flash photography I like to use a heavier hand
5:02for the lips
5:03I decided to line my lips for fuller looking smile yes we're almost done just
5:08finish off with the lip color of your choice
5:10I decided to mix up my own color a nude pink shade
5:15well
5:18and now that my face is done i'm going to finish off this look with the hair
5:22braid one side of your hair like this
5:25any braids will do for me is a little lazy i'm just going to stick with the
5:29traditional raid
5:31yeah
5:38and when you're done reading just tuck it in the back and take a bobby pin and
5:42pin it in place
5:46that's it I know it's super easy right
5:52here are some extra tips if your eyes get red before the photoshoot use eye
5:57drops
5:57this will make your eyes appear brighter refreshing oil blotting sheets are a
6:03must before you take that photo blog any excess oil instead of powdering your
6:08face
6:08you don't want to over mattify your face or else your face will lack definition
6:12for me I like to stay away from dangling earrings because it can shorten the
6:17length of my neck
6:18small earrings like these are cute and will always be in fashion
6:22mmm what to wear since most likely you'll be photographed from the waist up
6:27Lucas more around this area maybe you can try and find a pretty neckline or
6:31play around fun colors
6:39and if you're wearing glasses make sure they're non-reflective
6:46and there's nothing wrong with keeping it casual
6:55intricate necklines are great if you want to bold luck and if you want more
6:59focus on your lower neck area where a scoop neckline with fun patterns
7:03this will open up your neckline or maybe you can start for that
7:06scarves are so fun to wear perhaps you're feeling a little edgy
7:11don't be afraid of spikes hopefully you won't get in trouble for wearing this
7:14because it could actually hurt someone
7:16and I'll also be doing a DIY video and how to spike up your jacket
7:20the next video will be about posing for the camera and finding your best angle
7:27stay tuned and i hope this video was really helpful good luck everyone and

0:06mmm
0:14gorges here's a beautiful edgy look for you to experiment with this fall
0:21highlighted cheeks straight brows framing tapered smokey eyes paired with
0:26the peach nude or fibrin glue it
0:28oh and shout out to my designer friend at human aliens for making the sick body
0:33suit
0:33he combines my two favorite things fashion and Anna me
0:37ok let's get started before you beat your face with makeup
0:42you want to make sure you have a clean smooth canvas to work on this is why
0:46exfoliating is essential
0:48you can either use a gentle scrub to polish off the skin or my favorite way a
0:53gentle exfoliating peel like this one by skin inc
0:56so i've been using this product for over a year and I loved it so much I had to
0:59get it seemed to sample it in the glam bag
1:02all you have to do is apply this product on your face and you'll notice right
1:05away your dead skin peeling off the kind of look like a racer crumbs weird and
1:10kind of gross but it pays off from here just rinse your face and now touch your
1:15skin
1:16it should feel baby butt smooth this is my favorite hydrating skin missed
1:20no joke I wasn't paid to see any of this this dewy skin mist has saved my skin
1:25because it's so dry in LA after a few good sprays my skin instantly looks and
1:31feel supple
1:33for this look I decided to go for straight brows with no arch so that
1:39means i'm going to cover up the corners of my brows
1:42i'm just going to use concealer but i recommend using either non-toxic glue
1:45stick or spirit gum with wax for a more realistic look
1:50however for the sake of this tutorial and me not wanting to remove the glue
1:54from my brows
1:55I'm just going to opt for concealer you guys get the picture for my brows
1:59i'm applying a soft mix of hazel and dark brown matte shade with an angled
2:04small brush draw a straight edge using the inner corners as a guide
2:08I'm tapering line upwards this will create an illusion of the lifted face
2:13for your eyes warm up some concealer between your fingers and use it as an
2:20eyeshadow base use loose final powder on a fluffy brush to set the concealer on
2:30your lids
2:32this will reduce any creasing using the same brush apply a dark brown color to
2:39the outer corner
2:40increase using a window wiper motion you can create a lot of depth and dimension
2:45with just one that color
2:47it's all about layering and how hard or light or application pressure is now
2:52with a metallic burgundy eyeshadow and using a small shadow brush pack this
2:56color onto your outer eyelid you want to concentrate the color as close to your
3:01lash line as possible to create more depth using a tightly packed blending
3:05brush blend out with the darkest color extending it to the crease and right
3:10underneath the eye from there
3:12find a warm tan color and blend this color under your eyes to balance them
3:16out with the same burgundy color accentuate the corner of the under eye
3:21and from there to sweep the shadow into a tight wing using the fine details
3:28angle brush
3:33get your wing just the way you want it
3:36and once you've sculpted out the shape you like clean the edges with a makeup
3:40brush for that precise edge
3:42ok let's take a break from the eyes onto the face
3:46take a rose gold cream shimmer and lightly Pat onto the apples of your
3:52cheeks for that base glow and from there
3:55using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream spot rate your face to reduce
4:00redness or blemishes
4:02so that your skin tone is even and natural-looking if you're more into that
4:06poreless flawless face find a foundation that has a high coverage if you're like
4:10me and you prefer a natural skin finish use a BB or CC cream that has a light to
4:15medium coverage
4:16apply a light hydrating lip gloss and let it soak into prep your lips with the
4:21same loose powder from before using a smaller face brush loaded up and feather
4:26over any shiny area
4:28okay now back to the eyes using your favorite eyeliner pencil or any liner
4:32that has a small brush sharpen the wing and line the eyes
4:36one trick that I like to use is to start at the inner edge of the line and apply
4:40in small strokes keeping the liner angles and pressing it up against the
4:45side this will easily give you the thinnest line imaginable for the outer
4:49corner wing it out by outlining first and then fill it in
4:56with a gold cream pigment apply a tiny amount using the small detailed brush on
5:02the inner corners and bottom lower lash line from there
5:06just blended together by using the same color to illuminate your upper lid
5:10i'm going to use this nifty product from Korea it's a dual ended stick to give
5:14yourself puffy eyes or a go sell in Korean literally means charming skin
5:19first step
5:20a few millimeters under your natural lower lash line draw a line with the top
5:24grin from there
5:26flip the pen over and use the shimmering white side carefully . between the line
5:30and just true
5:31it's kind of crazy what a little bit of taupe and shimmer can do as if you need
5:35to make your eyes any bigger
5:37but if you want to give her lashes a good curl and apply generous coats of
5:41mascara i chose one that has long bristles so that I could literally comb
5:46through my lashes to separate them
5:48if your brows are needing to be tamed use a brow gel to sculpt them in shape
5:52this tiny one here is by benefit and it's perfect for travel and it has
5:56fibers in it to give the appearance of actual brow hairs
6:00moving on using a light pearlescent cream shadow added to the inner part of
6:05your upper cheek bones for that highlight action
6:07this will make your cheeks appear fuller and we'll give you a more youthful
6:11appearance
6:12now it's time for the lips to prep them and prevent any lipstick from leading
6:17outline them with a lip liner similar to your lip color and with your favorite
6:24peachy nude lipstick apply this on your lips
6:27patting it on with your finger to get rid of any excess residue
6:31if a peach nude is too basic for you go crazy with the new bold lip color this
6:36liquid lipstick from jeffree star is super fun and hydrating formula stays
6:41put
6:41all day just make sure to carefully apply in little strokes and don't forget
6:45the sides of your mouth and in between your lips
6:48it doesn't matter what lip or makeup you decide to go with
6:52just make sure to wear it confidently because makeup is an expression of one
6:56of your many side
6:58express confidently and of course good luck
7:02yeah
7:12yeah
7:24yeah
0:00you
0:14I always believed that we as people are multifaceted beings
0:20there's a part of me that loves darkness I feel like I can hide in the shadows
0:25and disappear like a mystery
0:28I know it's cheesy but this is my alter ego you want to start off by pulling
0:33your hair back and using a cleansing wipe to get rid of any excess makeup
0:37dirt and oil on your face
0:39we want to start with a clean canvas as the temperature gets colder
0:46your skin's natural layer of moisture tends to dry out
0:49you can get rid of any flaky dry patches by using a microdermabrasion skin
0:54exfoliant warm it up in your hands and want the product onto your skin using a
0:59circular motion and once you're done just rinse it off your skin should look
1:03and feel polish after us Foley eight try to moisturize your skin or else it's
1:08gonna feel really dry and stiff you want to find a hydrating moisture mask to
1:13soothe your skin and now that your face is hydrated do the same on your lips
1:19coconut is a natural humectant which means it will help draw moisture in and
1:24keep your lips a little longer
1:26coconut is life all right moving on
1:30start taking those brows using a quality slanted tweezer try not to go overboard
1:35because you want your brows to stay full and natural-looking allow for some time
1:40before going out because there might be redness from the plucking
1:46using a cream highlighter apply this to the tops of your cheekbones you want to
1:50do this under your base to give your skin a natural do we look if you want to
1:54look younger
1:55a dewy complexion will help get you there one of my top three favorite
1:59cushion compact is by I obey this compact is called the six-second compact
2:04as they say one is sold every six seconds
2:08I wasn't paid to say that true fact the cushion applicator provides a light
2:12feathery coverage that will cling to any imperfections
2:16you don't really need to cover your entire face just patri your face until
2:19redness and blemishes or less noticeable
2:22all right now it's time to break out your favorite concealer so i've been
2:25using this cushion concealer and at first I didn't think i would like it but
2:29now I kind of use it for everything
2:32concealing and highlighting for this one you can use it under your eyes as well
2:36as other dark spots on your face such as blemishes and the areas around your nose
2:41and mouth
2:42so just blend out your concealer until it looks natural
2:47now it's time to set your face by stippling once and press powder
2:50I have right here this doll 10cc powder it's pretty unique because it has green
2:55and pink be even any imperfections and discolorations on the skin
3:00what's nice about it is that it doesn't have a Kiki finish before you buy any
3:04powder read reviews or test it out to make sure it's not chalky the powder
3:08should look and feel silky and refined
3:13find a dark cream eye color like a deep tongue or burgundy and warming up
3:18between your fingers when I only have five minutes to do a smokey eye
3:22this is my go-to method apply a dark cream eyeshadow or eyeliner directly on
3:27your eyelid lightly with your ring finger
3:30if you want more precision use your pinky finger keep dabbing to blend the
3:33shadow the murray blend the smokier and softer it look so now with your favorite
3:39pencil liner and using the back of a tweezer to hold the island in place
3:43create small strokes like this along your waterline
3:47personally I think this is the easiest way to apply eyeliner
3:50it's pretty much full proof and provides a nice smoky effect for more precision
3:55you can take a stiff angled brush to create that wing see you'll be a master
4:01at the smoky eye in no time
4:02tight lining is when you apply liner into the rim of your upper and lower
4:06lash line
4:07it feels kind of weird at first and your eyes might water but you kind of get
4:11used to it
4:12oh the things we do for beauty use a black felt-tip eyeliner to punctuate the
4:17shape and intensity of the wing
4:20perfect on my lazy days which I have a lot of i skip eyelash curling
4:27however it's useful for opening up your eyes unless you have naturally curly
4:31eyelashes and lucky
4:35when applying mascara to your upper lashes look down when applying it to the
4:40bottom
4:41look up or straight that way your body's natural reflex doesn't freak out when it
4:45sees this stick poking near your eye
4:48moving on to the brows using the taupe eyebrow pencil create feathery strokes
4:53to imitate little brow hairs using an angled eyeliner brush add fullness to
4:59the browse by flipping them out when your boo is complaining that you're
5:03taking way too long to do your makeup
5:05tell him next time browse over those when both eyes have the perfect lines
5:11use the wings as a guide to add more dimension to your crease with a small
5:15eyeshadow brush and using the same cream eyeliner intensify the depth of your
5:19eyes
5:20ok let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the cheeks find a dark brown
5:27hair that's three to four shades darker than your skin color to carve out your
5:31cheekbones with a fluffy angled brush to keep your contour as natural looking as
5:35possible use a light hand and try not to get too close to your mouth
5:40add bronzer along your temples to accentuate your face
5:43all right back to the eyes find a glittery eyeshadow in with your pinky
5:49because it's super tiny pop this shimmery eyeshadow along the inner third
5:53of your eyelid blending with your ring finger
5:56this will help bring more magic to your eyes
6:02by now my lips are nice and soft
6:05thanks to the coconut bomb and it's ready to be painted black
6:09before I apply any color make sure there's not a product left on the lips
6:13you want to remove any lingering concealer or foundation with a wipe
6:17giving yourself a clean canvas to work with ok now the moment of truth
6:23break out the darkest lip color you have start with the biggest areas on your
6:27lips around the center of the bottom and top lip
6:30it's kind of like painting within the lines so start with the largest areas
6:33first from there
6:35carefully apply the lipstick to the outline of your lips and it's totally
6:39fine if it's not perfect because we're going to clean it up later if you want
6:45more precision use a smaller brush to adjust the lines for a cleaner shape
6:52very nice
6:56all right moving on to hear if you're not using argan oil in your hair
7:00you're missing out all the nutrients lost during coloring treatments and heat
7:05styling can be restored if you use oils like argan oil the Royal Egyptians were
7:10young to have beautiful silky hair
7:12thanks to oil what you want to do is warm up the oil between your hands and
7:16finger comb through your hair for that silky finish
7:20and now it's time to transform into my alter ego
7:25there's a lot of beautiful temporary tattoos that you can find online or on
7:29etsy find your favorite design that speaks to you if you don't know exactly
7:34where an important part of the design is going to be placed
7:37what I like to do is cut a notch in the paper before I apply here I cut out a
7:43little notch in the middle of the neck application so I know exactly where to
7:47Center it and once you have it on and it's nice and centered had lightly with
7:51a water-soaked paper towel or sponge try to make sure that it thoroughly wet
7:56if you want to check to see if it transferred peel back one side slightly
8:00and if the tattoo is revealed
8:02you can safely peel the whole thing off from here
8:06just add more tattoos where you see fit
8:10tell your own story through these tattoos
8:14the art and design should inspire you don't worry they're only temporary
8:19so you can experiment as many times as you want with zero commitment
8:24now my alter ego look is complete if you're going to recreate your alter ego
8:28look
8:29make sure to tag me in all your pictures so that I can see now and like them
8:33mmm i love you dreamers good luck
8:40yeah
8:54yeah
8:59yeah
0:00yeah
0:00so i'm really loving taylor swift's me look and in this video i'm gonna show
0:05you how to recreate it
0:06majority of the products that i'm using in this video are from december's ipsy
0:10glam bag but if you don't have one no worries because i'm going to describe
0:14the colors as best as i can and you guys can use any products that you have that
0:17are similar at your disposal
0:19first thing first primary eyes primer is not only great to help saturate color
0:23but it also helps prevent smudging
0:26all right let's recreate Taylor's famous eyeliner look using Urban Decay's 24-7
0:31black liner
0:32I'm going to load it on my brush first the reason why I'm using a flat edge
0:36eyeliner brush is because sometimes the tip of the eyeliner pencil can be a
0:41little too blunt
0:42so what i'm doing here is i'm just flicking the brush ever so slightly to
0:46create an illusion of twinkling looking eyes like Taylor's notice how the cotton
0:51swab has a point your end
0:53cosmetic grey cotton swabs are seriously a must have for all you make up levers
0:58ok so finish line in your eyes and let's move on to making your eyes sparkle try
1:04and find a champagne loose eyeshadow color of your trace the 1 i'm using here
1:08is mixed ultra pearl mania eyeshadow pigments tend to have a stronger payout
1:13than regular eye shadows because the intensity is stronger uses as
1:18highlighter for your eyes to help brighten them up
1:20ok so depending on how much I laid space you have
1:24I prefer calling it eyelid real estate what i'm doing here is bringing my
1:28eyeliner up a few millimeters below my crease line
1:32so here's the thing this smaller and thinner your eyeliner is the bigger your
1:36eyes will look because you're showing your lips space
1:39be careful not to make your eyeliner shape too big or else you can look like
1:43an anime character
1:48now it's time to curl your lashes to get them nice and perky
1:55what you're going to do is apply mascara on your upper and lower lash line
2:02we move the eyes are done moving on to foundation before you do anything prime
2:08your face
2:08i'm using the same Mirabella one that I used on my eyes
2:13yeah
2:17take your foundation and if you want to match Taylor skin color
2:21she has a very fair complexion so I'm just going to go a few shades lighter
2:24than my own skin color blend away
2:30with a cosmetic sponge dipped in white cream add this to your cheeks nose
2:35bridge and chin to highlight this area
2:41and it's time to bleach my hair so i can turn it blonde
2:44this is honestly the worst week I've ever use
2:47sadly i ordered it online and I didn't try it out before the tutorials so i had
2:52to make do because all the workshops were closed as long as you guys get the
2:55picture
2:56a fake lashes for that extra glam
3:01and if your eyes are blue like Taylor's use blue contacts to match your icon
3:06time to contour your nose and cheekbones
3:08i'm using a matte taupe color you want to make sure that it's matt and don't
3:13use any shimmery bronzer or won't look as natural time to highlight the face
3:21i'm using my Couture is highlighting the sheets I'm just gonna tear one sheet out
3:25and highlight my cheekbones to recreate Taylor's glowing skin and of course you
3:30have to finish off with her signature red lip color I'm going to line my lips
3:36like so and sculpt them in to match her lip shape you want to use concealer
3:46around the lips to create a very precise lip shape
3:52time for the last step just finish off with the red lip gloss of your trace the
3:55red lip gloss that i'm using here is by be a bombshell
3:58it is impossible to go around with red during this holiday season
4:03actually you really don't have to look like taylor to rock this classic look
4:08finished
4:10I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
4:22good luck everyone and don't forget to check out XKCD com the beauty community
4:27i created for you guys
4:28happy holidays
0:00summer is finally here
0:10my favorite part about summer is hanging out with my friends and finding ways to
0:14capture more memories which means i gotta make sure your look at gunpoint
0:20so i'm going to show you how to achieve that glow doing skin that will last
0:24sweats & Son start off with the cleansing wipe and clear off every trace
0:30of leftover makeup dirt and oil
0:33prep the skin with a cooling cucumber facial mask the cucumber works to combat
0:39readiness by soothing this area
0:41just wait 10 minutes and then clean up your face
0:45so i've been using here this nifty new skincare product from Korea
0:49it's called a cool poor stick that provides a thin layer of moisture that
0:53combats dry spots and the best part
0:55it doesn't leave behind a sticky texture now that your skin is prepped
0:59you're ready to move on to make up begin with an oil-free primer and apply this
1:03along any area of the face that tends to get shiny
1:06if you have large pores or fine lines this will soften and reduce the
1:10appearance
1:11i love using a brush whenever i'm applying primer because it really gets
1:15into all the nooks and crannies
1:17moving on to foundation I like to cocktail a few products so I'm mixing in
1:21a dewy formula with my favorite long-wear BB cream that has a built-in
1:26sunscreen
1:27this gives me buildable coverage with a subtle globe
1:30i'm all about that glow
1:31for your under-eye gently . a light concealer and softly to fuse with your
1:41ring finger
1:42now that you've perfected your skin beat your face with a soft translucent powder
1:47to keep everything in place
1:52next add some dimension to your face while warming up your skin with a matte
1:56bronzer bronzer outline of her face like around the temples cheekbones and under
2:01the jaw line
2:02try and keep your application light and let your radiant skin shine through you
2:07should look sunkissed not Burt
2:09cool so moving on to rise prep your lids with a flesh tone base because the skin
2:14around the eye area is so thin blood vessels might show through but a flesh
2:19tone base or concealer will help reduce the appearance and now that your eyes
2:23are primed get a neutral palette that you're crushing on this one's pretty
2:27legit
2:28all right go in with a tan colored shadow and use this as a wash on your
2:33lids to warm up your eyes
2:36yeah
2:38next color up should be am at smoky color add this deep shade all along your
2:43upper and lower lash line and blend it out
2:46we want a nice hazy smoldering look to make sure to blend blend blend it should
2:51be a subtle gradient
2:53here's a fun tip try and use another clean fluffy brush to haze out the color
2:57to maintain dimensionalize take a light nude eyeshadow and pop this color under
3:03your brows along the brow bone and continue blending
3:11time for some shimmer and sparkles find a sparkling peach tone color and paint
3:16this along the inner corner of your eyes to highlight this area using a metallic
3:21copper color add this along the top of your eyelids and softly blend out
3:26highlighting key areas on the eyes will help make them stand out more
3:30if your brows are sparse like mine here find a tough shadow for your brows and
3:34color them in with a brush for a more natural look
3:38I like to top it off with a brow pencil by feathering in the illusion of brow
3:44hairs so try and find a double-ended brow pencil that has both the pencil and
3:49the spoolie I know once my browser set
3:52I feel so much more confident in my face feels complete
3:56oh my dear brow pencil you complete me why use a black eyeliner when there are
4:01so many colors to choose from
4:03summertime should inspire you to try a new eyeliner color just be bold
4:07try a deep teal eye liner and line your eyes as close to the lash line as
4:13possible and pops them along the waterline to intensify the eyes
4:17you don't have to draw a perfect line in one take especially if you have shaky
4:21hands instead you can actually build up the line until you have a flawless shape
4:26i know i said to experiment with more color for your eyeliner but if you
4:31prefer to stick with your trusty old black liner try a gel baseliner instead
4:37this works better during the summertime because one its water resistant into
4:41it's easier to apply try to experiment with different eyeliner brushes until
4:46you find the right one
4:47you feel confident with all you have to do now is curl the lashes as used and
4:52apply several coats of mascara and through your lashes feel fat and juicy
4:57yeah bring in the light with a highlighter makes your highlighter with
5:01a bit of bronzer for that summer glow and touch this across your cheek bones
5:05use a warm highlighter and with a smaller brush dab the highlighter along
5:09the high points on your face for that dewy finish if you want a more natural
5:13look
5:14use the fan brush and sweep the highlighter across your cheeks for
5:18subtle highlight if you happen to be taking photos with flash the light is
5:22going to reflect off the highlighter
5:24so your cheekbones look . for lips there are so many fun colors to choose from a
5:29red a blood orange coral pink or you can try out the new metallic lip trend
5:36yep it's all about the late nineties and early two thousands

5:44and everywhere
5:45once you're done applying your lip color if you want a full lip allusion to have
5:49a bit of highlighter along your Cupid's bow
5:52I used to color my hair every six months and it became so dry and brittle that
5:57I'm actually taking a break from harsh coloring and instead I'm nourishing the
6:02ends of my hair with hair oil find one that's infused with vitamin E

0:00hey gorgeous i'm going to show you how to recreate this spring beauty look
0:04using some of my favorite cruelty products and also i'm going to show you
0:11how to recreate this cute DIY succulent as always start with a clean face d puff
0:17and awaken your eyes using under eye patches or chamomile tea bags
0:21leave them on for a few minutes and remove say bye to your puffiness your
0:25skin is going to feel super refreshed time to prep your makeup so just stipple
0:29on a primer to help smooth out your skin
0:31try to focus around the t-zone area because this is where you're going to
0:35see a lot of shine
0:36keep puffing in whatever is left on the brush and let's move on to brightening
0:39up that I area using a small brush apply concealer gently around your eye area
0:45try to be gentle around this area because the skin around the eyes is very
0:48delicate use any excess product even out dark spots in any blemishes on the skin
0:54I tend to have a lot of redness around my nose engine area so I like to pack on
0:58a little more concealer around here majority of your skin problem is not
1:02what you put on your skin
1:04but what you put in your body and how stressed out you are so try your best
1:08eat healthy and relax the more you're stressed out
1:11the more your skin will show it try using blotting papers to control oil
1:15this is by far my favorite blotting paper brand apparently it's from japan
1:18in geishas use this to touch up your makeup
1:21press them on anywhere to minimize shine and lightly go over them with powder to
1:25enhance the effect
1:26doing this helps keep your powder from looking too cakey also if your boyfriend
1:30is not into makeup
1:32what you want to tone down that shyness and pictures try using this instead of
1:35powder
1:36trust me on this one depending on your skin type if you have oily skin use a
1:40powder highlighter
1:41if you have dry skin use a liquid or cream highlighter highlight your cheeks
1:47and take whatever is left on the brush down your neck and across your shoulders
1:52this will give you that beautiful shimmery glow keep your brows natural by
1:56lightly filling them in and defining their shape with a pencil eyebrows are
2:00very personal and will change as you grow so keep experimenting
2:04once you have a shape you like run the spoolie over your brows to blend the
2:07pencil out this will give it a more natural finish
2:10just keep the hairs in place by sweeping them up and out for the eyes
2:14we're giving them a sweet pastel pop of color take a nude pink and Pat this all
2:18over your lower lash line and lid
2:20this will bring a more romantic mood to your eyes now you can take a pastel blue
2:25color and pass this along your upper lash line bringing the color out blend
2:29out the eye area with a fluffy brush to give your eyes a subtle wash of color
2:34try and keep it light for the liner take an icy blue pencil and place it around
2:39the inner corners to open up your eyes keep lining up words along the inner
2:43half of your lid and into the crease like this to touch right under your brow
2:47bone and blend out to highlight this area and to finish off just set the
2:51cream pencil with an iridescent white eyeshadow
2:56now if you want to make your eyes stand out even more
3:00take a dark eyeliner pencil and tight line your upper and lower waterline
3:04everyone has their favorite way to line their eyes I prefer doing it with a
3:08brush
3:09so with an angled liner brush when it over the pencil and then stay as close
3:13to the lash line as possible
3:15sweep the brush out to create a double wing and don't forget to line along your
3:19lower lash line as well to help balance out your eyes from here just curl your
3:23lashes and apply a few coats of volumizing mascara for that finishing
3:27touch with neutral tone contrast stick to find the shape of your nose
3:34blending as you go with a small fluffy brush this will give you that cute
3:37button nose effect
3:38add dimension to your face by applying some bronzer to scope out your face and
3:44apply blush to add color to your cheeks or lips
3:47line them the nude pink color and fill them in taking a baby pink matte lip
3:53cream place it in the center of your lips and blend it out with a fluffy
3:57eyeshadow brush to keep the color from bleeding
4:00as you can see you have baby dollops clean up the edges of your lips with a
4:03little bit of concealer on a flat synthetic brush
4:06perfect ok so moving on to hear i'm using this rainbow barrel curling iron
4:11to create loose tousled waves
4:13seriously this is the prettiest curling are never right you want them to look
4:16natural and undone so wrap the hair around the barrel
4:20wait a few seconds and release
4:23ok
4:26for nails find a bright vibrant pink or baby blue nail polish to match the
4:33spring colors finish off with perfume that smells like a fresh spring day
4:38personally I love using rollerball perfume because they're super easy to
4:42travel with and you just need to have a little along the wrist like this and
4:46gently press your wrists together for that incident sent add a touch along
4:50your neck line as well
4:52haha you're finished now you should look like a daydream
5:00bring a little nature to your world by creating your own succulents
5:04all you need are some succulents from a garden store a glass jar and some tart
5:09super easy right
5:10d pot the plants one by one into the jar and carefully fill in the extra space
5:15with some dirt
5:16you don't want to pack them into tight let them breathe and now just add a
5:20little bit of water to keep them happy and hydrated
5:22make sure you give them water every two weeks their desert plants so they don't
5:26need tons of water but they do love the sunlight so keep them by your window

0:00hi dreamers I wanted to create a beauty look inspired by my aura photograph each
0:07and every one of us has energy pulsing through our bodies and using
0:11state-of-the-art technology we can actually see the electromagnetic waves
0:15we radiate from within these waves are translated into colors so I invited a
0:21team of experienced or photographers to come into the studio for a reading this
0:25machine was able to capture my inner light
0:28each color corresponds with the mood in treat how you feel on the inside
0:32reflects on the outside you might not be able to see the light
0:36but those who are sensitive can sense it I guess you can say this is kind of like
0:40an inner selfie
0:41after seeing my own aura I was inspired to create this dreamy look that will
0:46make it look as if you're glowing from within
0:48all right let your inner beauty shine through by starting with a clean face
0:53i'm using here this soy milk cleanser to keep my skin supple and smooth
0:57put some on your hands and spread it all over your face massage your face as you
1:01go and rinse optically alright so moving on to a mat poor reducing primer evenly
1:07apply this product using a stippling brush
1:10onto the lips you can add a touch of a moisturizing lipstick with a hint of
1:16tint
1:16this will enhance your natural lip color giving your lips and nice flushed
1:21look there is definitely beauty in simplicity time for foundation take a
1:26few pumps on the back of her hand and load some onto your stippling brush
1:30the goal is to avoid covering your entire face
1:33you just want to even out your skin's natural texture and color focus on the
1:38areas around your nose lips and eyes for a bit of coverage around your eyes use a
1:44creamy concealer to conceal your dark circles
1:46try finding a hydrating concealer because you're under eyes tend to be a
1:50little bit more dry than the rest of your face
1:54take a little extra and tap it on as eyeshadow base
1:58remember to be gentle with the delicate skin around your eyes
2:01don't ugh it's totally normal if your lip shape is not even if you want to
2:05reshape them take a little more concealer on a small synthetic brush and
2:10line your lips to even out the shape
2:12afterwards just be sure to blend out with a sponge whatever you have left
2:16over
2:16just even out your eyes and blend that out as well
2:20ok now you can take a nude highlighter and accentuate areas of your face
2:25wherever the light naturally hits your face accentuate that area you can apply
2:30along your brow bones inner corners of your eyes a little on your nose cheeks
2:36and keep its bow
2:38here's a fun tip drawing small crosses on your cheeks will help highlight
2:42without looking too harsh and with a brush slightly blend out the highlighter
2:46light will reflect wherever you apply this highlighter
2:51this will give you that in chanting glow as for your eyes take a sheer creamy eye
2:55shadow and Pat it all over your lids for a wash of color
2:59try finding a beautiful lie light color and if you want to go for a more air
3:04deficit look on your eyes as if light is coming from within
3:08take a frosty white shadow to brighten your inner corners and bring this glow
3:12all the way up to your crease framing the inner half of your eye place any
3:16leftover product on your brow bone and tap it along the lower lash line
3:20this will give your eyes a halo effect on to eyeliner
3:24we don't want this look to appear too harsh so just tight line your eyes by
3:28lifting up your lashes quickly and gently gliding the pencil along the
3:32upper waterline
3:33if your eyes get watery it's totally normal once you tightly under eyes
3:37add some of this pencil eyeliner on an angled brush and wing it along the upper
3:41lashes
3:42let's give some love to your lashes find a mascara with a tiny one this one is
3:46perfect for getting extra close to the roots of your lashes
3:50creating a tight lining effect so come thru your favorite mascara that has a
3:55natural finish you want to make sure to keep your brows looking natural for this
3:58look so use a pencil or powder to fill them in enhance the shape but don't
4:03overdo it
4:04brush the hairs into place and blend out the color if your browser appear drawn
4:08on
4:08try using feathery strokes this will give them a more natural finish
4:12all right take your favorite highlighting powder and we're basically
4:15going to cheat that glow from within
4:17use a tapered brush highlight on the areas on your cheats where light is
4:20naturally hitting it and whatever is left over on your brush
4:24just tap a little on your forehead unless you already have a nice curved
4:28forehead
4:29I'd skip this step continue building up your highlights until you've reached the
4:33glow you're satisfied with using your index or ring finger . some product
4:37under your eyes to punctuate the halo effect and if you want you can even
4:41highlight your collar bones so that the light can reflect off of them and if
4:45you're looking to give your lips that aura like low use a lip liner that
4:49slightly deeper than your natural lip color line your lips and blend it out
4:53just keep repeating until you're happy with the shade and shape of your lips to
4:58soften the look of your lips take a soft pastel lipstick that compliments your
5:02skin tone and place it all over
5:05now with a frosty shadow from before Pat it on the center of your lips
5:10finish it off by adding a nice tinted oil that will add extra moisture and
5:14shine
5:15don't look like the hair it needs to be shiny - I'm a huge believer in using
5:20hair oil take a dime sized amount of argan oil in the palm of her hands and
5:24rub them together to warm up the product and from there just run your fingers
5:28through your hair
5:29focusing on your ends keep finger coming until your hair feel soft and you see
5:33that shine
5:34all right and now you can style your hair I'm going to keep it simple and use
5:38my trusty old hair clip that super 90 is looking
5:42click the sides of your hair back and take a few front pieces to frame your
5:46face and now my dear you're done go out there and let your beautiful or shine
5:51through

0:00hi beautiful a lot of you have been asking me to create more hair fashion
0:04nail and makeup tutorials so an idea popped in my head
0:07inspired by sailing captain planet these gorgeous ladies here including myself
0:11are combining our forces to create this multifaceted tutorial cosmic candy
0:18ok let's start with Jesse if you're getting bored of your plain black
0:22t-shirt or short
0:23look no further than the stars for inspiration you'll need a few sponges
0:27brushes glitter spray pastel fabric paints and a spray bottle filled with
0:32water
0:33what your sponge and loaded up with the lavender shade start tapping the paint
0:37onto the shorts when you're painting anything Galaxy inspired
0:41it's all about creating depth with these colors make sure to blend out any harsh
0:45edges
0:48now that you have the base done it's time to layer more colors to give your
0:52shorts more dimension take a light neutral shade like a white or silver and
0:56use this as a highlighter wherever it feels two dimensional highlight continue
1:01adding depth using mid tone colors like magenta and teal and you can add that
1:05cosmic touch
1:06I carefully flicking white paint from a small brush
1:09look you just created stars pretty be one with the galaxy shorts blend out the
1:15edges as needed and repeat these steps to continue layering for your desired
1:19look
1:20and if you feel like you're at a good place use your small brush again for the
1:23finishing touches
1:24it's all about the details here you can create starburst planets
1:28whatever for that extra effect spray a little bit of that silver or white color
1:34thus creating a sprinkle of star clusters
1:39yeah
1:41yeah
1:42moving onto Kristin if you want to recreate her out of this world now look
1:46you need to make up brushes
1:48these are denser than regular arts punches and will ensure even application
1:52to start take a protective base coat and layer this on your nails
2:01now you can coat and iridescent white polish on top of the base coat
2:06depending on your polish formula you only need one to two coats
2:12now just top it off with a light pastel pink color because you have several
2:17layers of paint on your nails
2:19you're in this awkward stage where you can't really do anything that requires
2:23serious hand movements so i can watch your favorite show
2:27read a book or go online basically kill time at least 10 minutes for your nails
2:31to dry completely
2:33no one is perfect that's why nail polish remover was invented
2:36so load up an old eyeliner brush with nail polish remover and clean up any
2:41smudges perfect colors you will need are a magenta purple shade a vibrant pink
2:47and a powder blue and if you want a more subtle look focus on creating a
2:51statement nail instead of painting all of them
2:54you can paint directly on the sponge combining all the colors and press this
2:57onto your nail you want to use this time to experiment so
3:01unleash your inner Monet using the pointed edge of a cuticle stick a
3:05toothpick paper clip
3:07basically anything pointing make little crosses and dots to recreate the stars
3:11all right from here just top off your nails with glitter
3:16now it's time to dry that means time to veg out and be a princess because you
3:21can't do anything with wet nails
3:23once you're in the clear add a clear glossy top coat and you're done
3:28so pretty sailor moon would dig this krispies hair color will change
3:32depending on the mood now she's going to show you how to give your hair that
3:36galactic edge using hair chalk
3:39first thing first make sure you're wearing a shirt that you're not going to
3:42miss because talking is messy
3:44the night before prep your hair with a leave-in conditioner because chalk is
3:48drying to begin
3:50take a small section of hair focusing on the ends
3:53place it between the makeup sponge and blue hair truck press lightly and pull
3:57through to get the best color payoff
3:59repeat this step using a green color applying it above the blue for a
4:03gradient effect and after you've done a third of your hair spray it with
4:07hairspray to set it before the color can transfer or shake off
4:11repeat these steps until all your ends have been chopped and set
4:15once you're done show and tell take a selfie aunt Agatha's moving on to Katie
4:21she's here with a space-age lip look just be sure your lips are clean and
4:25prepped take a nude cream lipstick and load this color on your lips

4:34a fluffy brush apply a white iridescent loose pigment all over your lips now
4:39with a purple pigment brush this color along the inner corner of your mouth
4:43keeping the color as you go do the same with a teal shade placing it along the
4:48outer inner corner
4:50using a pearly blue color blend out the edges of the teal shadow onto your
4:54Cupid's bow and lower lip and with a bright magenta color do the same to the
4:59purple color and to bridge
5:01everything together use a rose gold color on your lower lip and blend
5:05if you want to accentuate fullness with an iridescent white pigment passed this
5:10along the center of your lower lip to complete your look gorgeous
5:15a unicorn would approve eyes inspired by the bright colors of space start

5:31back and forth find a map in color and apply the shadow right on the empty spot
5:36focusing on the inner half of your I ready to make your eyes sparkle

5:45close to the lash line as possible

0:50priming the skin find one with a built-in moisturizer a primer helps
0:55create a smoother skin surface minimizing pores and fine lines
1:00however if you're a teenager you can skip primer you don't need this stuff
1:04so to supply this baby all over your face or just spot treat on any problem
1:09areas like an oily t-zone
1:12now you can take a nap of concealer and gently apply under your eyes
1:16you want to be extra gentle because this area is very delicate
1:20all right if you're looking more alive than you are good
1:24so we can now move on to our favorite foundation or BB cream for a while I've
1:29been substituting my foundation with a cushion compact like this one
1:33this was a gift from korea from something that instead of using your
1:37hands or brush cushion compact has a very specific application with the
1:42cushion sponge provided dab it on the sponge soaked in BB or CC cream and very
1:48lightly dab on your face like foundation BB or CC cream from Korea is very
1:54different than BB and CC cream from the West
1:57the coverage is light to medium in the finish is Dewey so i recommend trying
2:01different formulations before settling with your Holy Grail
2:05so continue dabbing the cushion sponge all over your face until you even out
2:09your complexion
2:10when I know how to cheat a flawless complexion use a lightweight highlighter
2:14there are two parts to healthy looking skin complexion and luminosity a
2:19highlighter can help punctuated this by giving you that boost the key
2:23less is more you need just a little small dabs here and there on the high
2:27points of your cheeks and forehead and tip of the nose and Cupid's bow ready to
2:32blush with a shimmering peach blush
2:35loaded up with your brush and locating your cheekbones lightly dust the brush
2:40all over this area
2:41building up the color for this look you don't want to look as if you're wearing
2:46blush it should look as if you're really blushing
2:49all right it's time to move on to the eyebrows if you have sparse brows like
2:53myself here
2:54use a matte powder that's a few shades darker than your own hair color and
2:58lightly fill in your brows
3:02if you need more definition use a brow pencil and sketch little hair marks with
3:08your spoolie brush blend and soften any harsh marks
3:14on to the eyes take a matte taupe eyeshadow color and contour your lids
3:21sweeping the brush back and forth
3:23make sure it's blended we're going for a soft look
3:27yeah
3:30now take a deeper terracotta color and deep in the outer corner blending and
3:35diffusing the color into the creases with a fluffy shadow brush with a
3:43smaller brush use a shimmering sunset peach and build the color up starting
3:49around the inner corner of your eyes and blend out this is going to help warm up
3:53your eyes
3:54tap a small brush into a vanilla highlighter and very carefully blend
3:59into the inner corner of your eyes and along the lower lash line
4:03this will help bring more light to your eyes and dab whatever is left along your
4:07brow bone for extra definition going back with the fluffy brush soften and
4:12blend the colors together using an eyeliner in a plum color carefully
4:17line your upper lashes making sure to stay as close to the lash line as
4:22possible
4:22mmm everyone looks good with the winged eyeliner so go ahead and sketch that
4:27line out make sure it tapers up because this will help lift up your eyes and if
4:33you want a fuller lash line tight line your upper waterline
4:37this might feel uncomfortable at first but believe me it will look good
4:42no pain no game if you want to brighten your eyes take a white eyeliner and
4:47gently line along their lower waterline
4:50and add a touch along the inner corners of your eyes and if you want a more
4:54subtle option
4:55try a peach a rose gold eyeliner you know what time it is time to perk them
5:00lashes
5:01hold your lash curler for a few seconds on each I veteran as so if you're
5:06lacking in the lash Department like myself here
5:09use a lash primer to give your lashes that boost
5:13it's like stilettos for your lashes coat your lashes from root to tip making sure
5:18to flick the wand out at the ends now you can take your favorite jet black
5:23mascara and place it over your lash primer to complete the lashes apply
5:27generous coats
5:30just give the lower lashes and instead mixer taupe and terracotta colors
5:34together and staying as close to the lash line as possible
5:39shadow in this area now it's time for some glam
5:42yes honey but real talk here at the start of the new year fireworks
5:48banging pots and pans basically making real loud noises right after midnight
5:52was said to help ward off any evil spirit and bad luck
5:56instead of fireworks and banging pots and pans i'm going to use this glitter
5:59liner as a symbolic gesture
6:02just place a little around your inner corners to add a fun accent lighting up
6:07your eyes now for those lips in Chinese culture
6:10red is a symbol of happiness and good fortune
6:14so for this look I'm gonna rock a matte red lip
6:17ok so this lip liner has an ankle tip actually pretty useful because I can
6:22create any shape and line with ease
6:25if you want a bold look over draw a little over your Cupid's bow and make
6:29the lines tangled very carefully fill your lips in focusing around the edges
6:36and now it's time to top it off with a red matte lipstick so filling your lips
6:42and get it if you have a dark plum lipstick or eyeshadow softly built
6:51around the corners of your mouth
6:53notice how this creates depth giving it a darker touch
7:00yeah
7:02blend the color with a brush and then reapply the dark plum if you want to
7:06increase the intensity and once you are happy with the depth reapply the red lip
7:16color to top off the look for extra credit
7:20use a flesh tone pencil and sharpen the edges for a flawless look we're not done
7:27yet
7:28you want to smell as good as you look so damn a bit of your favorite fragrance or
7:33essential oil on your wrist and gently press them together for a lasting effect
7:38when I know a trick that will drive that someone special crazy
7:42apply a little behind your ears and along the sides of her neck mmm for your
7:48hair
7:48try a volumizing oil sprain working towards the end and just finger comb
7:53through your hair to distribute the product evenly finished yay

3:14center of your lips and Cupid's bow and if you want to glam it up add a touch of
3:18gloss on your lips

5:09because people
5:26yeah
5:28yeah
0:00hey guys so this look right here i'm going to show you how to get it
0:04all right let's bring back the nineties with this crunch BTW look
0:10you want to start off with a naked face by wiping it clean with a cotton pad
0:16you should look as if you're not wearing any foundation so try using a BB or CC
0:21cream
0:22that's going to help give you that no makeup look
0:25apply a thin layer on your face and Pat to blend find a concealer that can cover
0:31and lasts a few swipes under your panda eyes is all you really need
0:36and with your ring fingers Pat gently to blend and whatever is left over
0:40just use it around the nose and on your eyelids to reduce redness know you can
0:45use a powder that you're loving and dusted under the eyes
0:48Pat's him on the lids and oily areas on the face to reduce showing if you prefer
0:53having glowing skin just use blotting papers instead of powder
0:56peace out Greece and if you're lacking in the brow department
1:01no worries just use a grayish brown powder to fill in your mouse
1:05this will create the illusion of fuller looking brows use a pencil to draw and
1:11redefine the brow shape sketch little dashes to mimic brow hairs and
1:15use the spoolie brush to soften the marks so that they don't look so drawn
1:19on let's break out your eyeshadows find am a camel color in with your brush all
1:25you really need is an applicator and blender and use this color along the
1:30outer third of your eyes to create the illusion of depth and shadow load a
1:36little bit of the camel color on your blender brush and buff the color along
1:40the outer third again to create a hazy look
1:44follow the natural contours on your eyes you'll notice right away how big they're
1:48gonna look find a mas color with a pearl finish and add this color along the
1:53outer lash line
1:55this is going to help wide in the shape of your eyes giving them a sexy look
2:03and just top off your eye makeup with a metallic gray denim color and you can
2:07use your clean ring finger for this part
2:09just Pat it on the center of the lids and use your brush to feather it out for
2:13smoldering finish if you have a dark brown eyeliner colored use this under
2:18the lower lash line and outer upper lash line
2:21this will help accentuate the shape of your beautiful eyes
2:25if you already have curly lashes just skip this step but if you don't use a
2:31lash curler to perk up the lashes
2:33this opens up the eyes right away find a mascara that can give you sky-high
2:38lashes sweep generous codes through the lashes and watch them grow and just keep
2:44applying generous coats until you've reached the length you're happy with
2:47because we're going to use a lip liner prep your lips first with a lip balm and
2:52i'm just going to use a very light layer of my pillow plush and berries for the
2:56cheeks you can either contour for that supermodel circulated cheekbones or use
3:02a multi blush for a light touch of color on the cheeks trying to avoid pink and
3:07peach
3:07it's not going to work with this color palette add this on the cheekbones and
3:11blend with your fingers
3:13another way to apply is too low the color directly on your fingers first
3:17quickly padding the cheek area for that blushing finish with the dark red or
3:22plan what color outline your lips first
3:25this will prevent your lip color from feather and then just fill in your lips
3:29to help boost the longevity of your lip color
3:33very nice onto the lip color find a dark plum or oxblood lip color and paint this
3:42rich color on the lips
3:44try and use a brush especially when you're working with a dark color so that
3:48you can have an even application
4:01and for my nails I decided to wear a dark red wine color
4:06who would have guessed they now make hair CC cream crazy
4:10so use your favorite styling cream and warm it up between your fingers breasts
4:14before running them through the hair for that texture bedhead finish
4:24looking good and if you want that finishing touch
4:28just enhance your scent with a light fragrance and this is why i love
4:32rollerball fragrances because a light touch on my wrist is all I really need
4:37and if you want to grab that special someone's attention just add a little
4:41bit behind your ears
4:42normal soon you should smell as good as you look
4:46all right beautiful just share your brunch beauty look to me by hashtagging
4:50mish look and if you happen to get lipstick on your teeth
4:57just use the thumb sucking technique and you'll be good to go
5:01all right everyone i hope you had fun with this tutorial and good luck
5:18yeah
0:00yeah
0:02yeah
0:04hey gorges I have an enchanting beauty look for you to try out
0:09it's perfect for a music festival or any summer parties start with a cc or BB
0:16cream and lightly Pat this over your entire face with your clean hands
0:25the stream you can also use a foundation or stippling brush or sponge
0:33concealer should be used sparingly remember a little goes a long way
0:38all you really need is one swipe under the eyes down the bridge of your nose
0:42for highlighter around the sides of the nose and mouth to cover up any redness
0:46and all blemishes
0:47try using your fingers to apply this warms up the product and makes the
0:52application smoother and easier blend away for a flawless finish
0:57as of lately I've been using to brow pencils to fill in my brows
1:03if you ever look closely at your brows you might notice that towards the inner
1:06corners they're more sparse and towards the end there more full your brows don't
1:11have to match your hair color
1:13you should either be darker or lighter depending on the look you're going for
1:20on the ice start with a matte cream base to even out the color of your lids
1:29next apply a shimmering lavender color along the crease of your eye and blend
1:34away
1:35this will give your eyes a tin chanting mood through the canyon
1:42the next step take a light pink eyeshadow and apply this all over the
1:47lids and blend up into the crease you wanted to look as light and airy as
1:51possible
1:53add more dimension to your eyes with highlighter lift up the eyes with a hint
1:58of shimmer along the inner corner of your eyes and brow bone
2:08to open up your eyes for that summary look use a sunshine yellow eyeliner on
2:13the bottom waterline
2:16notice how much brighter the eyes look your eyes will definitely stand out in
2:20pictures to really give this look a bowl pop use a vibrant blue or teal color to
2:26line the top and bottom lash line
2:28i'm going to start with the lower lash line first keeping the line thin now
2:33just lie in the upper lashline staying as close to the lash line as possible to
2:37intensify the eye makeup
2:43and extend out to form a cat eye
2:50gently soften the edges with a clean brush
2:53this will give your eye makeup that theory look and if you're looking for a
2:58more subtle look just switch out the blue liner for something more delicate
3:01and natural like a navy or dark brown almost done with the eye makeup
3:06we just need a few swipes of your trusty little mascara for perky lashes finish
3:10off your summer look with a beautiful baby pink lipstick
3:13keep your lip color natural because this look is all about your eyes as much
3:19there's no ax to bold or too simple that's not worth your self expression i
3:24challenge you to explore and test your boundaries play with color patterns and
3:28styles and looks
3:30I believe there's an artist and everyone
3:33so let's find the artist within you break out your pencil and paper because
3:36i'm going to show you how to draw a beautiful face with the light hand start
3:40out with the circle the most fundamental shape doesn't have to be perfect from
3:44here draw across and split the circle in half
3:47follow the horizontal corners of the cross and create a triangle shape
3:51this marks the chin area and on the horizontal line of the cross marks where
3:55the I should be in the ears should line up to the eyes the nose will sit around
4:00the bottom of the circle and the lips will be within this area
4:04so take this time to flesh out the face shape you can create cute chubby cheeks
4:08supermodel sunken cheekbones or whatever draw what makes you feel better
4:12and once you have a general idea start erasing the guidelines to reveal your
4:17face shape
4:18everyone has a signature way to draw nigh so take this time to play around
4:22with different shapes for a basic almond-shaped I draw a curve and draw
4:27the bottom lashline feather out some lashes to open up the eyes and draw a
4:32rectangle shape to create a reflection in the eye and repeat the same step for
4:36the other hand
4:38and after your eyes are drawn it's time to erase the guidelines
4:43take this time to add in the details for the eyes
4:47just two simple marks for the nostril and a line for the nose bridge
4:50as for the lips keep the lines curvy and soft so here's where the beauty
4:54techniques help Heather at the lines to create subtle brow hairs as if you're
4:58really filling in your brows as for the hair

5:41here's something cool i want to share with you guys
5:44I had my own mural painted on a giant wall in Soho New York
5:48these guys are on another level that's some impressive painting right there
5:52they changed up the mural every week to coincide with the beauty video i was
5:56uploading that week
5:57it started off with an Egyptian queen lip and natural everyday look
6:02a robotic chic look and lastly a unicorn look crazy talented huh
6:13I've been away for a while and I really missed you guys
6:19I spent an entire month just traveling for work and decided to take a week-long
6:23vacation in Korea with tom
6:25I had the most incredible time there I can't wait to share my travel diary with
6:30you
6:31I can already tell that this is going to be an unforgettable summer
6:50can't wait to see you guys on the next video don't forget to subscribe for more
6:55love you
7:04yeah
0:00who knows what's gonna happen in the future
0:07I say live for today and dream for tomorrow because nothing is ever
0:11promised
0:13yeah
0:21ok
0:25before applying makeup
0:29make sure your face is polished and moisturised i recommend exfoliating your
0:33skin twice a week
0:34if you have normal to dry skin three times a week if you have oily skin and
0:40if exfoliating is too harsh on your sensitive skin
0:43try using a gentle makeup cleanser instead try and avoid any products with
0:48harsh chemicals so that it doesn't irritate your skin find one that has
0:52natural ingredients and once you're all skincare it up and you want to boost
0:56your makeups longevity use a mattifying face primer apply this product on any
1:01oily spots on your face like your nose and forehead
1:04really work the product onto your skin because you're creating a barrier
1:08between your skincare and makeup and once you're all primed up
1:11let's get started with face makeup using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream
1:16and with your clean fingers brush or my current fav Christian cream sponge apply
1:21your product evenly on your face and back to blend out to create a smooth
1:25even finish
1:29perhaps in the future dark circles will be a thing in the past but for now
1:34concealer will do the trick find a neutralizing concealer that can cover up
1:38those dark circles
1:39especially for any of you who aren't getting enough sleep you want to find a
1:42product that will offer high coverage you'll find that you're going to use
1:46less product and it will look much more natural and less Kiki
1:50ok so powder way to steal your face makeup in
1:58undo the browse some people don't need to touch them but for the rest of us
2:03filling and reshaping them can make a world of a difference
2:07don't believe me watch a little flake here and there and watch your brows come
2:11to life with the black trim the eyeliner take the time to run the pencil along
2:22your lash line and feather it out and if you're going for a nonchalant look stop
2:30here
2:30but if you want to clean it up and give your line and nice edge use an angled
2:34liner brush and start smudging a line to sculpt your perfect liner shape
2:39try and find a creamy eye liner for this technique or else it might get a little
2:44draggy and we don't want that
2:46not for your delicate eyes find the natural contours of your eyes but
2:52instead of marking it here
2:54go a tiny bit higher to elevate your eyelid shape

1:46pigmented shadows to prime the lids as well as the top and bottom lash line
1:50I primary will help boost the color intensity of your shadows

2:02and line the eyes with a bold color of your choice

0:06yeah
0:16hey everyone i have here an edgy look for you to try out
0:32have your face foundation ready and let's go
0:35because this look is so I heavy fill in and shape your brows first your brows
0:40are the frames to your eyes for this look I recommend keeping your brows skin
0:45here with a higher arch you want to find a brow pencil that has a whack space so
0:50that when you fill them in the wax will lay the hairs down so that they don't
0:54stick up just create little strokes and watch your brows magically come to life
1:01try and use a fully to blend out the marks to help soften the look so that
1:05your brows don't look as if they're drawn on
1:08but for some of you who don't need to fill in your brows well aren't you lucky
1:13using hear my new york city smokies palette or just find any silver smoky
1:18eyeshadow palette apply a shimmering pale peach color on your legs
1:22the trick to using silver eyeshadow is to make sure your base is warm
1:26silver can make your eyes look a little bit too cold
1:30like steel so warm it up with a soft color
1:33now select the metallic medium gray color and using a small brush create an
1:40edge by following the natural line of your I dabbing the brush along the way
1:44and once you have the cat eye shape fill in only the outer corner of your eyes
1:50leaving the rest of your I clean
1:54ok so now that you have your vixen cat eyes in place
1:57let's break out your liquid liner i'm using here my new scribble liquid liner
2:01that just launched in tattoo black
2:03I decided to name its Gribble because you can create thin and thick lines with
2:07the flick of the brush if you want to find the perfect liquid liner
2:11look for a brush that's flexible and can give you the greatest control the
2:15formula has to be smooth
2:17you should be able to create the perfect line with ease
2:20no skipping or dragoness so draw your lines so that it contours with the cat
2:25eye and if you want to go a little more Egyptian on this look because it's so
2:29popular draw another thin line under the first one for that exotic look
2:36take your time when you're creating your new lines we all know that liquid liner
2:40is not the most forgiving beauty product but once you've mastered the line you
2:44can create endless looks alright just curl your lashes and give them a few
2:49good squeezes your lashes are supposed to look curled not cramped and from here
2:56just apply a clean lash lengthening mascara
2:59I would avoid dramatic lashes since this look is all about the eyeliner and if
3:04you want to balance out your eyes
3:06just apply mascara on your lower lashes
3:19of course i'm using here my favorite water liner in rose gold
3:24i'm going to apply this along the inner corners of my eyes and water line to
3:27help brighten them up
3:36and because i'm feeling a little fancy i'm going to add silver lining inside
3:40the empty eyeliner space and if you're feeling ambitious create a very very
3:46thin outline along the cat eye shape
3:57this is going to give you a fun graphic look
4:00yeah
4:01from here just contour into your thing because this look is so sharp and edgy
4:07I want my nice to look a little more defined

4:18of your ice
4:22and just blend that bottom lash line out for a smoke your look
4:32we're almost done sculpting your cheeks with a bronzer load of your brush and
4:40locate the natural shadows for your cheekbones are and accentuate the shadow
4:44by shading the bronzer around here

0:05about you
0:06all right start out with a bare face and let's get to work
0:11the dab of foundation can go a long way
0:15look for a product that has a matte or shine free finish with the foundation
0:20brush or a sponge create and natural skin texture on your face
0:24this will help create an airbrush finish
0:28make sure everything is blended away and let's move on to the next step
0:33powdering your face if you want to maintain the longevity of your face
0:39makeup use a matte powder
0:41try not to use powder all over your face just along the areas under the eyes
0:45around the nose chin forehead to reduce shininess dab away and set the powder
0:51concentrating under the eyes and on the t-zone
0:54once you're done with foundation and powder let's move on to your brows
0:58perfectly arched dark brow helps to find this look
1:06if you really want to perfect the arch of your brows try drawing
1:09indistinct line through the brow to give you direction and shape and afterwards
1:15just fill it in and blend away try experimenting with different color
1:18shades for your brows
1:20you might be surprised by how much it can change up your look
1:23and now that you have the perfect base in canvas
1:27it's time for the fun part adding color and definition
1:30i'm using here this nice matte multiple it's perfect for a matte look you want
1:35to use a product that has a strong color payoff
1:37so that you just need a little bit less is more
1:41another way to use matte multiple is too wet your hands first and then touch the
1:45multiple and start applying the product on your face and just passed this on
1:50your cheeks for that second skin finish your contour shade should always be Matt
1:54shininess draws more attention to features and makes them more prominent
1:59while darker matte shades creates more depth and once you've laid out your
2:03color blend away to shear perfection
2:20I'm all about multifunctional tools so the more ways you can use a product
2:24better if you want a more bronze kiss look use this along your forehead for
2:29that summer look
2:38just keep lending away and let's move on
2:45on the eyes Matt of shadow is all you need
2:48this is an essential must have color for your eyes especially if you need to
2:53contour your eyes
2:54add this along the hollows of your eyes to create more depth
2:57my sig and using a dark brown color line your eyes
3:01upper and lower to create the illusion of bigger looking eyes
3:14pop of color like pink is perfect for the cheeks
3:18even though the product is matt still brings life in dimension back to your
3:22face
3:23rosy pink cheeks are perfect for spring look to add this on the high points on
3:27your face
3:33all right you know this step curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for
3:37mascara
3:38once your lashes are curled apply a volumizing mascara that you can build up
3:43with several codes from there
3:49finish up your lips with a rosy pink matte color to soften your look if you
3:53want balance you need to have the opposite
3:56so i'm using here a metallic rose gold eyeliner on my waterline to help right
4:01in my eyes
4:02just because we're creating a matte look doesn't mean everything has to have a
4:05matte finish
4:06I'm all for shiny hair once it starts looking Gracie
4:11we should fix this that's why a dry shampoo is a must have for me if you
4:17want to stay on trend find a bright pastel nail color shiny or not using a
4:22mattifying top coat will instantly modify your nails or you can you Steve
4:30- have fun trying this new spring trends that make up that hair and nails
4:35don't be scared to experiment you never know what you'll discover

5:00yeah
0:00a selfie is like a self-portrait you want to capture the best version of
0:05yourself right
0:06and after that there are so many filters you can choose to help enhance your
0:10picture
0:11well in this video I'm going to show you how to enhance your skin without the
0:15need of a filter
0:16let's start with basic skin care step one cleanser use a cleanser that works
0:22for your skin type is it tries boilie normal or a combination like myself real
0:28of them
0:29if you have a dry skin type use the cream cleanser and if it's oily use a
0:33gel cleanser and if you're looking to exfoliate your skin wash your face with
0:37a washcloth to gently scrub away to reveal perfectly polished skin feels
0:46gonna step number two you
0:49I cream
0:51and you really just need a pea sized amount
0:54use your ring fingers and start patting it on like this
0:59your ring finger is the most delicate finger try not to stretch or tug this
1:03area around just softly have the product around your eye area
1:07step number three skin serum a sara is very concentrated
1:12two pumps is all you need to do and apply this all over your face and neck
1:19think of a ceremony like a supercharged booster for your skin care routine
1:23some are made to help reduce aging and at me others can brighten and repair the
1:28skin
1:28step number four moisturizer or lotion a dime sized amount is all you need and
1:36apply this all over your face and neck after washing your face that healthy
1:40sebum layer is gone
1:41so by using moisturizer you're recreating that barrier to keep
1:45hydration locked in a lot of moisturizers can prevent water loss next
1:50step lip balm
1:51i'm assuming most of you are already using a lip balm
1:55if not find a lip balm that works well for you no different from using a
1:59moisturizer on your skin
2:00lip balm will help keep your lips from drying out locking moisture in
2:04no makeup all skincare
2:06get your foundation and blush ready i'm using here my love me for me foundation
2:11in shell number nine and then with my rounded foundation brush start applying
2:16the foundation around the center of your face and forehead first cover up any
2:20redness and even out your skin
2:23after foundation if you need to cover up any spots or dark areas use concealer
2:29most people have dark circles so it's not a big deal with people see you with
2:33them but then again i know people who look better with their dark circles
2:37kind of like a vampire but if you look more like a zombie
2:41try to reduce them by lightly concealing them it's not about erasing them
2:45it's about lightening up the dark area will make a huge difference
2:49see before we finish the face makeup
2:52you have to seal everything in with powder you can either use translucent
2:56powder or a powder that has coverage like the one I'm using here like
3:00foundation start around the center of your face and move out so that in photos
3:05of filter won't be needed to perfect my skin
3:10and right now if you purchase ends love me for me powder compact you get a
3:14matching foundation for free
3:16all right let's get back to this tutorial for my brows if i'm looking for
3:19a softer look I prefer using a brow powder or an eyeshadow that matches your
3:24brow color you want to make sure you're using an angled eyeliner brush to give
3:29you better precision when you're creating your brow shape I like to draw
3:32a line on the bottom of my brows first so that I can see what my brows will
3:37look like before filling them in and from there
3:40just make little strokes to create the illusion of brow hairs and lightly brush
3:45with a spoolie to soften your browse
3:46ok we all know this step curling the lashes my lashes are not curly and they
3:52grow straight down so i personally have to curl my lashes to lift them up
3:56however if you have naturally curly lashes well aren't you lucky ducky use
4:01the lash lengthening mascara because we want long clean looking lashes
4:05alright final step taking care of your hair I color my hair a lot lately i've
4:11been using leaving conditioner and hair oils to replenish my her
4:16yeah
4:17so we're done no filter needed good skin care and foundation

0:04but then we have those days when we look and feel like the Queen because I want
0:13my skin to look flawless
0:15i'm going to be using face primer first I actually recommend this product for
0:19guys who want to reduce shiny face without the makeup look smooth this all
0:24over your face and let's move on to concealing take your favorite concealer
0:29i'm using here my trusty old great cover up concealer and with my Beauty Blender
0:33sponge I have right here i'm going to show you my current face makeup routine
0:37with a little bit of concealer on the sponge
0:40I'm dabbing a Touch under my eyes to brighten and conceal any of the dark
0:44areas and sometimes what I'll do is add a lighter concealer shade around my
0:49cheek area to create the illusion of fuller looking cheeks so just smooth
0:54everything out and powder up
0:56you can either use a sponge a powder brush or a powder puff to gently apply
1:01the powder on the area where you used concealer or foundation if your
1:05foundation or concealer has a matte finish
1:08you can skip this step all right time for the brows
1:11i'm going to be using two pencils and a brow filler to create my brow look for
1:16today
1:17I'm taking my brow pencils here called arch and using a color that matches my
1:21draw hair
1:22I'm going to fill in my brows if you naturally have full brows
1:25you might not need much work however for me I have to literally draw my brows on
1:31by creating feathery strokes
1:33once you're done creating your brow shape an extra step I like to do is add
1:37a brow filler brush this over your brows and you'll notice right away how natural
1:41they look find an eyeliner or eyeshadow in an amethyst color and outline the
1:46outer third of your eyes
1:48what you want to do is create a wing shape just by following your natural
1:52contour and from here
1:54just fill in the line is if you're coloring in a leaf you want to make sure
1:58to leave the center of your lids empty and from here with the brush quickly
2:02smudge the color to create a soft gradation you can use a blending brush
2:06if you need it
2:07using here a teal or turquoise color outline the outside of the amethyst
2:12color
2:12don't cover up the purple take the color down along the outer lower lash line and
2:17stop at the halfway point just blend in the deal so that it has a nice smooth
2:22transition into the purple patil and amethyst combination will create this

4:59so I'm
5:48a little skipping
0:00sorry sorry I'm late
0:03Ben and I were fighting this shark and science cat and I lost track of time
0:07anyway I'm here now milady and I have brought to you half an orange LOL nice
0:16now make that green there dude yeah that's good
0:21oh and young ja okay yep
0:24again can be actually dad and that's better
0:29hi had to make sure my translator was on so what do you get when you combine a
0:34unicorn with a rainbow a Rainicorn inspired by one of my favorite
0:39enchanting characters in Adventure Time Lady has perfectly pink skin
0:44so begin by lightly stippling on a base of BB cream or liquid foundation
0:49I prefer using a BB or CC cream because it feels lighter than foundation
0:54plus it has a moisturizing base will also help moisturize your skin - BAM
1:00the power of good concealer is pretty much as good as magic
1:03you can use your ring finger to blend or do what I'm doing taking the back of the
1:08brush and having to blend
1:10all right now we take a cherry red lip balm and dab it on the lips to prep and
1:15soften them for later
1:16I'm gonna throw on some blue contacts circle lens better yet if you want to
1:21give your eyes a more magical lip and now that your eyes are magical next step
1:26will require crime in your eyes I'm using here a champagne shadow primer
1:30gently dabbing it on my lids
1:38with the ring finger apply a bright yellow on the center of the lid
1:43this will be the base color for the rainbow with another clean finger or a
1:55brush apply a sky-blue along the outside corner of the eye pad on and blend
2:01around the corners to soften the edge node of your brush with the shimmery
2:10lighter blue and blend into the crease adding as you move along the eye for
2:15more control
2:23take a blending brush and blend to soften the edge
2:28let's try to keep this looks soft like a cotton Kenny and now take a hopping
2:34shadow and to create that beautiful rainbow effect take a flat side shadow
2:38brush and dab this color into the crease you want to try and keep the line subtle
2:42pink is a very strong color if you used too much it might over on the ice
2:48a rainbow is created when light is reflected through droplets of water in
2:52the sky to give that shimmery effect of water droplets apply a sparkly shadow on
2:57the brow bone the next color will be purple with a smaller brush at this
3:02along the lower lash line to balance out the eyes
3:04you want to make sure to add a cooler color on the bottom since we have pink
3:08on top on the inner corner of the eye by the tear duct apply a shimmering white
3:13shadow to brighten up this look
3:17all right take out your black liquid liner gently feather out a black liquid
3:24liner on the top corner of the eye
3:26keep the line thin we want to make sure that your eyes are as open and as round
3:30as possible
3:31just like ladies so that means curling your lashes and applying generous coats
3:35of mascara
3:43Lady Rainicorn doesn't have very defined eyebrows
3:50so this brow look is really up to you I want to try and keep this natural
3:54looking so gently
3:56fill in your brows with the neutral tone color close to your natural hair color
3:59because I'm wearing a blond way to match ladies here
4:05brush a little bit of a blonde brow gel over your brows to lightly 10 them to
4:14really make the eyes pop line the bottom waterline with a rose gold liner
4:18this will really open up your eyes more for the lashes
4:25I need a little more help in this department so i'm going to apply
4:28individual lashes the trick for this step is to use a clear glue and to apply
4:34with the term user so that you have better precision
4:36ok so now you're ready to move on to the rest of the face for your cheeks are
4:42rosy pink cream blush will do the trick
4:45apply this on the upper cheek bones and blend it out with a fluffy kabuki brush
4:50because you might need a little more definition around the cheekbones take a
4:54bronzing blush powder and apply this on the apples of the cheeks
4:58blending to the outer corner of the face as you go
5:03Lady Rainicorn has a delicate small mouth
5:06so if you have bullets take your concealer that matches with your skin
5:10tone and erase the sides of your lips
5:12this is going to create the illusion of a smaller mouth
5:16you want to make sure to blend so it doesn't get cakey and after this just
5:21powder to make sure the concealer doesn't slip inside
5:25all right time for some color use a pink or a rose lip color and apply this along
5:31the opening of your mouth to create a sweet delicate look this look is very
5:37innocent looking perfect for a lady
5:41all right now your magical look is complete
5:45magical colorful and completely adorable
5:48this is Lady Rainicorn
6:00now all you have to do is learn Korean and find your boyfriend Jake
6:13oh okay Cisco
6:16Oh responded to our calls out about vision to study English gonna buy this
6:22one device against me on a penguin or media and that means good luck
6:30ingredients
6:43yeah
0:00giving it again again again and that's winning game that swing game and that
0:03swing and again again again again
0:06a few minutes me and the roaring twenties i think i was born in the wrong
0:15era but with a little help from my friend called makeup
0:19I can transform myself into the ultimate flapper girl
0:22let's start off with foundation to help even out your skin with the stippling
0:25brush sponge or your clean fingers
0:28apply your foundation on your face I prefer to apply my foundation first
0:33around the center of my face because I need a little more coverage here then
0:38the rest of my face
0:39like forehead engine just make sure to blend so you don't have any Street marks
0:43especially down towards your neck
0:46all right let's move on to the heavy duty stuff
0:50concealing i'm curious to know what kind of makeup they use during the twenties
0:55to achieve perfect looking skin
0:57today we use stuff like a peachy salmon concealer color because it works wonders
1:02on covering up dark circles
1:04I prefer to use my gentle ring finger to apply concealer along the delicate area
1:09under my eyes
1:10all right this step is important applying finishing powder on your face
1:14to set the liquid and cream base makeup
1:17this will stop it from creasing and will also keep your makeup looking fresh all
1:21night long to make sure your skin has a matte finish
1:24let's move on to the fun part making up the eyes I'm using here my new brow
1:29pencils that just came in called arch by em cosmetics
1:33i'm using here the color medium brown and very carefully
1:36create your arch skinny over-exaggerated browse was the look
1:41unlike today where full brows are in back then
1:45every girl was drawing on her brows super thin just like Clara Bow 1920
1:50silent film star
1:51let's hurry up with eyeshadow with the medium brush loaded up with the matte
1:56taupe color and follow the natural contours of your eyes
2:04and once you're happy with how it looks
2:08the next color you should use is a matte black shadow and with the same brush use
2:13this to contour your crease again only this time it's going to look more
2:17intense in the taupe color
2:19what you're doing here is creating a strong contour shape to your eyes
2:23this will give your eyes more depth when I was coming up at this look I was
2:27really inspired by silent film movies
2:30be sure to keep the middle area on your legs clean will fill them in later
2:34so keep blending and bring the color down along the lower lash line
2:40this will help make your eyes appear more round use a shimmery my shadow
2:46add this on the area that you kept clean to fill it in with your brush again
2:51blend the shadow so that you don't have any harsh edge and using your black
2:59eyeliner here i'm using my water liner in black knight line the waterline
3:04gliding the pencil back and forth until you're happy with the intensity then
3:08bring the pencil up keeping the pencil as close to the lash line as possible
3:12and line your eyes
3:14we want to make sure that the line is as thin as possible so just keep darkening
3:18your eye makeup and with this measure tool smudge the creamy eye liner formula
3:22so that it gives your eyes a hazy look
3:31using another brush that has the same taupe color on it start where your brows
3:37begin and follow the line down the sides of your nose contouring your nose will
3:41help bring more definition to your face and after you curl your lashes apply
3:46generous coats of waterproof mascara
3:48why waterproof because it contains wax which will help hold a curl longer and
3:56when you're done with your eyes
3:57let's move on to the lips but first we have to reshape them
4:01this is a modern take on the Clara Bow lips with the concealer that matches
4:06your skin color start erasing the sides of your lips
4:09he want them to look smaller than normal we're creating very delicate shaped lips
4:14imagine if your lips were shaped like a heart that's kind of what we're going
4:18for
4:18so conceal a small portion of your upper lip and blend the concealer so that it
4:23looks as natural as possible using your powder again set the makeup
4:28you can't skip this step or else your lipstick and concealer will slip and
4:32slide find a rich red lipstick with the matte finish here i'm using my new matte
4:37lipstick in wine stain using a brush line your lips first then fill in the
4:42color you want your Cupid's bow to look extra point II think of it like two
4:46little mountain peaks
4:50haha you're not done yet
4:53you got a layer a darker plum color over the red to create a gorgeous rich
4:57vintage-inspired color so keep lending way did you know that back then it was
5:03extremely fashionable to be seen applying lipstick in public
5:07ladies would apply their lipstick and powder their faces right at the
5:11restaurant table
5:12there is no need to run to the bathroom for touch-ups and voila you're finished
5:16and now it's time to play dress-up

1:03more definition and shape

1:18to brighten up my eyes i'm highlighting the inner corners with the white
1:22shimmery eyeshadow
1:28to help bring in more definition to the eyes line the lower lash line and then

1:40and of course curl your lashes and apply mascara with this look
1:45I definitely want to add more volume with my lashes so it's time to add some
1:48false lashes

2:20afterwards I'm going to contour my nose and highlight the bridge of my nose and
2:24right above the cheekbone
2:25this will help bring in more definition to my face

2:38and then just finish it off with a lip brush as red tends to move easily over
2:42the lip line
2:43i also like to punch up the lip color with a little bit of gloss on the center
2:46of my lips to create an illusion of fuller looking lips and now you're ready
2:51to walk down the aisle looking glamorous but you can easily change up this look
2:55and make it more sultry with a few minor changes you'll be keeping the same eyes

3:08help brighten up the eyes
3:12apply a brown shadow to the outer corners of the eyes in a v-shape and
3:16work it into the crease to create more depth and definition to the ice

0:00becoming a bride is one of the most special days in a woman's life
0:04it's a day where your life is forever joined with another and it's a magical
0:08moment that you will always remember
0:13wedding season is upon us so it's a perfect time to show how to get a
0:17natural makeup look for your wedding day
0:19first find a foundation or BB cream that is as close to your natural skin tone as
0:24possible and then use your fingers to apply the product all of your face and
0:28with my new favorite rolling sponge
0:30I'm going to blend out this product I know it looks like I'm paint rolling on
0:34my face but it really works
0:36the next step is perhaps the most important step concealer when choosing a
0:41concealer try and find a shape that's two shades lighter than your foundation
0:44many brides don't get a lot of sleep leading up to the wedding so concealer
0:48is key
0:49unless you have a zombie themed wedding try and find a concealer that has a good
0:53coverage and now just finish off the face with loose translucent powder to
0:57modify the skin
1:00you
1:00because this is a very natural look i'm filling in my brows with the matching
1:04color to give my browser more polished and clean look
1:10and from my eyeliner i'm just going to use a dark brown eyeshadow color and
1:14lightly
1:15I'm going to line my upper lid next step illuminate the eyes
1:19what I'm going to do here is I'm going to highlight the inner corners of my
1:21eyes first and then the center of my lids and of course my brow bone to
1:26brighten up the ice
1:30to give my eyes a bit more definition I'm going to align it with the dark
1:34brown pencil I would try to avoid a black eyeliner because it can look a bit
1:38too harsh and now just curl your lashes and apply generous coats of mascara
1:50every bride has a glow on her wedding day whether its natural or makeup
1:54i'm going to show you how to get that beautiful bridal glow take a rose
1:58colored blush and added to the apples of your cheeks and then sweep it up the
2:02cheekbones for soft rosy glow
2:04then just take a light pink cheek stain to highlight your cheekbones for a
2:07luminous effect
2:11for a hint of color of my lips I'm taking a lip pencil and lining and
2:15filling in my licks
2:23as little girls we dream of what our wedding they will look like and then
2:27suddenly that magical day actually happens for all of the upcoming
2:31brides-to-be I wish you the utmost join your wedding day

4:08Day
0:00this tutorial today is inspired by the movie broken city where Catherine
0:08zeta-jones stars as the elegant wife of the New York Mayor start out their faces
0:18as usual and move right into priming the face i have here printing with the stars
0:23from benefit
0:24it's a kit filled with some benefits top picks
0:31using their eye shadow primer i'm going to . my entire eyes like this so that
0:35the primer is evenly distributed
0:42and with the delicate ring finger blend away
0:49timer not only helps with eyeshadow but it also helps with concealer
0:53so take your concealer the 1 i'm using here is from the benefit hit conceal
0:57your dark circles and eyelids and blend away with your ring finger
1:06and now the concealer is not going to smudge or settle into fine lines and
1:11once you're done just dab your eyes with loose powder
1:13this will actually help your makeup last longer and then let's move on to eye
1:17makeup for the I make apart i'm going to be using Lorax eyeshadow palette and for
1:23this tutorial I'm only going to be using my clean fingers to apply my eye shadow
1:28if you don't have any brushes or you forgot them on your trip
1:31no worries just make sure your fingers are clean and starting with your ring
1:34finger tap the base color on your lids gently dab it on like this
1:39pretty easy
1:42usually you want to use a smaller brush for the darkest color in this case we
1:46have our pinky finger the pinky finger will give you better control unlike the
1:51rest of the fingers with your pinky finger apply the darkest color along the
1:55outer corners of your eyes like this with the middle finger this should act
1:59like the fluffy brush blend everything together
2:01try not to mix up the fingers or else your eye makeup might end up looking
2:05muddy
2:10yeah
2:14whatever is left on your pinky finger apply this along the lower lash line to
2:18balance out your eyes
2:25for the highlighter let's use the index finger and apply this color along the
2:29brow bone and center of the lid to add more dimension to your eyes
2:36now let's take a bronze eyeliner or eyeshadow and add this along the inner
2:40corners
2:41usually if you want your eyes to have more of a doll like look use highlighter
2:45but if you want a more mature look a darker color along the inner corners
2:49like this using your black eyeliner line your eyes
2:52what i'm doing here is building up my line by making tiny little strokes
2:56filling in any empty spaces until I have one solid line
3:15time to curl the lashes and get them ready for mascara
3:22i'm going to be using to face better than false lashes mascara here at the
3:26lash extension system where you prime the iceberg build up the lashes and then
3:30seal everything in
3:34first step I'm going to wet my lashes with mascara
3:40and while the mascara is still wet and using their lash fiber one here i'm
3:45going to add a generous amount of their fiber onto my lashes
3:49this is going to help build up my lashes so that they're longer with more volume
3:52and now just steal everything in with the same mascara from step one
4:02not bad right it actually looks like i'm wearing fake lashes
4:06all right on to the next step browse her brows have a higher arch than my natural
4:10brows so I'm going to have to arched eyebrows a little higher than usual to
4:14recreate her brows
4:16finally we can move on to the face i am using here of foundation
4:20faker from the benefit apparently it's an oil-free cream to powder formula that
4:24perfects your complexion but it's not a foundation
4:27this is a really nice product but i only recommend it for those who have a good
4:31complexion because the coverage is pretty light
4:34if you need more coverage is better to use a foundation steal everything in
4:39with your powder
4:42and let's move on to the cheeks using tarts flesh
4:49I'm going to contour my face with this color applying it on the apples of my
4:52cheeks and brushing it out again
5:00intensify the contour by applying bronzer bronzer will give your face more
5:05dimension by creating shadow and whatever is left on your brush just add
5:08this along the sides of your forehead to create an illusion of a smaller forehead
5:17with an illuminator or highlighter at this on the tip of your eyeshadow brush
5:22and then start dabbing it along the highest points on your face your brow
5:26bone your cheekbones
5:28your skin will instantly look as if it's glowing giving you a healthy looking
5:32complexion
5:33since I'm kind of in a fancy mood i am going to use is Dolce & Gabbana bronzer
5:38scourges this is what the bronzer looks like honestly I didn't want to use it
5:42and I saved it just for this video so here goes
5:46as you can see the first application will be intense because of the black
5:50pigment from the leopard spots so make sure to really really blend
5:54after all the leopard spots are gone it's just going to be a normal bronzer
5:58for the lips i'm going to give them a mini spa by exfoliating all the flaky
6:02skin off
6:03this is the victoria's secret lip scrub scrub it's are made out of sugar so if
6:07you really want to make your own sugar lip scrub just add sugar to Vaseline and
6:11use that as a scrub instead
6:13wipe everything off with the tissue and your lips should be baby butt smooth
6:16apply lip balm as usual and get ready for lipstick finish off your lips with a
6:21beautiful warm nude lip color
6:35and now you're finished I love wearing bright colorful makeup looks but
6:39honestly I prefer simple natural looking makeup
6:43this is a very simple classy look that can be worn to work dinner in school so
6:48i hope you guys enjoyed this video
6:50good luck ha

0:01nature is the best place to find beauty inspiration because its natural pure and
0:06simple for this new year

0:12all teens watching who are new to beauty
0:15welcome
0:17the first step to restarting your beauty routine is taking care of your skin if
0:22you want your skin to look at it has to feel good
0:25hydration is key and josie maran argan oil is currently my must-have for supple
0:30smooth skin
0:31Arjun oil provides incredible moisture retention because the oil contains
0:35eighty percent unsaturated fatty acid and is more stable in sunlight than any
0:40other antioxidants
0:41so it's perfect to wear during the daytime it has natural healing benefits
0:45for scars and can reduce skin inflammation
0:49because it has high levels of vitamin E it's an effective anti-aging oil next
0:55step skip foundation and try either a tinted moisturizer or BB cream
1:00contrary to popular belief BB cream was invented back in the nineteen fifties by
1:04German dermatologist
1:06it was made for patients who had recently undergone surgery
1:09the purpose of BB cream was to protect the skin all while providing a light
1:13coverage for the wear today BB cream is also known as blemish balm or beauty
1:18balm and is an all-in-one face product that contains added benefits like
1:22sunscreen
1:23Sarah moisturizer primer and foundation think of it as your one stop shop for
1:28the face if you're not a fan of foundation or if you're not allowed to
1:31wear foundation try BB cream instead let your parents know that it's a sunscreen
1:36and skin care product that slightly tinted after BB cream powder the face as
1:40usual or modify the face by using oil blotting sheets when it comes to makeup
1:45i recommend all teenagers to redefine the brows try not to over pluck your
1:49brows the fuller the better but try to reshape them nicely when it comes to the
1:53brows it's all about finding the right shape for your look and if i get a lot
1:57of thumbs up I'll create a video on how to reshape your brows four different
2:01looks
2:02for my everyday eyeliner look I like to keep it really simple
2:05I'm going to load up my soho angled brush with my black eyeliner and of
2:09course line my eyes
2:10the trick to keeping it as natural as possible is to stay within the lash line
2:14area gently feather the liner out so it fades away softly and let's move on to
2:19curling the lashes hear what I'm doing is conditioning my lashes using the our
2:29general for all your mascara lovers you know how brittle your lashes can feel
2:33just like the hair on your head it's kind of nice to give your lashes and
2:36deep conditioning love

2:41they'll grow longer and feel stronger after conditioning your lashes apply
2:46mascara as usual to make your eyes pop

3:25glow
3:28you wanna know
3:30I admit I am the worst when it comes to moisturizing my body but this year I'm
3:34going to make it a habit to moisturize every day using here my pacifica tuscan
3:39blood orange body butter
3:41i am going to moisturize all the dry areas on my skin like elbows knees feet
3:46hands and pretty much the rest of my body because it's really dry
3:50let's try our best to avoid chalkboard arms and legs and moisturize every night
3:54and my sister here Christine is going to show you how she did her braids
3:58she told me that she learned how to braid hair from soccer practice
4:01by learning how to braid her team members here so i guess everyone was
4:04sitting in a circle and braiding each other's hair doesn't matter what future
4:11crazy dream to avoid flyaways and hair sticking all over the place
4:18take them down by hair spraying them down using my big sexy hair hairspray
4:23i'm going to set our hair in place and pat down the flyways
4:30here
4:32maybe and for the nails i'm going to use here my nail teeny polish provided by
4:38fc's January glam bag and with a toothpick or a needle coat your nail
4:43with the Polish and make sure it's really nice and wet and while it's still
4:47wet
4:47add a few dabs of green and layer them on top of each other
4:50quickly add a few drops of red and do this as fast as possible
4:55we need the polishes to be wet because the next step requires you to take the
4:58toothpick or needle and marble eyes the colors together like this
5:02you're basically going to strike the colors together with your dotting tool
5:07make cute little white dots repeat the same steps to all your nails and that's
5:11pretty much it

0:05perfect for princess
0:10let's start off with the ice here i'm using two faced shadow insurance and I'm
0:19gonna warm it between my fingers and Pat the champagne colored primer on my eyes
0:24not only is this primary going to keep my eye shadow from creasing and
0:27transferring but the champagne color will create a beautiful base layer for
0:32any of the eyeshadow color you're going to apply over it
0:34next step take this light color the one I'm using here is from Too Faced shadow
0:38bon bons palette and start applying this on your entire leads slow
0:48snow snow
0:54midway
1:03and
1:05Oh
1:09Oh
1:10using this lavender color that has a pearly texture and starting out around
1:16the outer third of the eyes passed this along the area to create more depth
1:22hmm
1:24and bring the color along the lower lash line
1:27stay
1:30take this topic color and add this along the middle part of your eyes
1:34but remember to keep the center clean what this is going to do is add warmth
1:39to your eyes without making your eyes appear overly icy and cold looking be
1:43really careful and try not to apply too much or else the colors will look very
1:47very money using my learn mercy caviar stick in plum dab this along the outer
1:55edge to intensify to look
1:58yeah
2:00cool
2:03and with a little brush start blending everything out
2:07try and keep the gradation soft or else it might look overly dramatic
2:12take this I see shimmering eyeshadow color brighten up your eyes by rimming
2:16this along the inner lower lash line and apply it on the center related for that
2:20extra Sparkle
2:22mmm
2:27using a little bit of the caviar stick in the deep plum color line your eyes
2:31stay as close to the lash line as possible
2:34dad the brush along the lash line creating little - Marc's eventually
2:39what's going to start happening is that you're going to connect the dashes and
2:42it's going to help create a continuous line
2:47this is my
2:48what I have here is really nifty eyeliner by NYX called the curve
2:53apparently you hold it like this as if you're pointing and you're holding a
2:57liquid liner horizontally and what you're going to do is of course line
3:01your eyes and again notice how I'm making little - Marc's connecting the
3:07lines along the way i recommend it for any of you guys who are bored of doing
3:12the same old liquid liner
3:20yeah
3:23time for the brows using this honest - air kit
3:27i'm going to create fuller looking brows build up your browser by gradually
3:33adding more color to them
3:45fill in any sparse areas and use the spoolie at the end of the brush to blend
3:51everything away and now as you can see i have fuller looking brows
3:59it's time to curl your lashes and get them nice and perky
4:03can
4:07thank you
4:08i'm using this really interesting mascara by pop beauty
4:12it's called the peak performance mascara and it's basically a twist up come fan
4:16mascara
4:21mmm
4:21so what i'm doing here is i'm coming up through my lashes
4:25it's actually not that bad but you kind of have to get used to it
4:42using my trusty armani master corrector concealer
4:47this is one of my favorite concealers i really recommend it
4:50I'm going to erase my dark circles and any blemishes and redness on my face
4:54because I like using a formula that's really easily blendable and it's
4:58foolproof
4:59now that my concealer is set i'm going to powder my face using L'Oreal True
5:03Match powder
5:10yeah
5:13I
5:15on to the next step
5:20blush here I'm using benefits famous lip and cheek satin stain
5:24i'm going to use just a little bit to add a beautiful flesh to my skin
5:29using a cheek stain is a great way to create the most realistic looking blush
5:34because it won't look so powdery and it won't have any word texture it's going
5:38to blend into the skin and we'll give you a really nice beautiful satin finish
5:43ok here's another interesting one and again is my benefit
5:49it's called fine one one and it's basically a new all-in-one chic and
5:55lifted having the highlighter section on the highest point of my cheeks what I'm
5:59gonna do is I'm gonna make a swiping motion like this and basically it just
6:02takes two swipes blend away and you're pretty much done
6:06i'm using my current favorite lip cream by NYX in dali girl
6:14it has a silky glossy finish add just a little bit on your lips to create this
6:19beautiful velvety finish
6:21I'm wearing all ever eaten jewelry here which is actually my own jewelry line I
6:26designed and this is from the new chapter to collection inspired by juliet
6:31from the romantic story Romeo and Juliet
6:34I star-crossed lover earrings it comes in three parts as you can see a gold
6:39half star that can be worn in front or behind the ear lobe and the backing of
6:43course and you also get a black diamond pave stone stud that can be worn alone
6:48or with the gold star
6:50here i have the dagger nail ring you can wear this on your middle index or ring
6:56finger
6:57personally i like to wear it on the middle finger and here is the glove of
7:01love handpiece that's definitely a statement piece
7:05I got to finish off the look with the crown of love head piece you can wear
7:09this in so many different ways and you'll instantly feel like a princess
7:12with this on
7:13so here's the finished no princess look it's a very soft romantic winter look my
7:19favorite part about this look has to be the eyebrows and cheeks
7:22I find that most people look more youthful with fuller looking brows and
7:26highlighter on the cheeks
7:28so if you're looking for a sweet innocent look this is a look for you
7:32Merry Christmas and of course they're black
7:38music by Mindy Gledhill hell
0:00I've been waiting to see the image you made such a terrible vengeance until a
0:07little drama you know the complicated doesn't appreciate the occasional twist
0:14mr. lon this look is inspired by the bond girl from the new Skyfall movie
0:24she has this dark family look that's perfect if you need a sensual holiday
0:28party look I can open up with my faux fur jacket because it's freezing out
0:33here
0:34start off with naked eyes and I'd like for you to meet matt from the bomb using
0:39their matte dark grey eyeshadow
0:40I'm going to fill in my brows so they're similar to sufferings
0:44sometimes i like to use pencil other times i like to use powder but in this
0:49case I want my brows to look really soft
0:51which is why I'm using powder next step using brow gel to set everything into
0:55place here im using shallow brow gel brow shells are great if your brows need
0:59more teaming it sets the hair in place so it doesn't stick around in different
1:03directions
1:04just one sweep of the brush is all you need with the same eyeshadow that you
1:08used on your brows start applying this on your eyes
1:10Pat it on like so and build up the color until you're happy with the intensity
1:17now with your angled brush start sharpening out the outer edge
1:24and do the same for the inner corners of the ice this will instantly give you
1:28vixen looking eyes
1:30now run the color along the lower lash line
1:33so the eyes are not too top-heavy this will balance out the eye makeup
1:37now with your blending brush softly blend the edges so it's not so harsh
1:43looking
1:50and once you're done take a black eyeliner the one I'm using here is by
1:53starlet line your eyes as usual
1:59winger your eyes just a bit and line your waterline to intensify this look
2:03more
2:04and take your brush to soften the eyeliner
2:12now you're ready for mascara
2:17carlashes
2:22using a volumizing mascara of your choice i'm using their real benefit
2:25apply generous coats of mascara and tell you happy
2:32yeah
2:34yeah
2:35and i'm going to use the bigger version of Matt to contour my face
2:40using a matte taupe color contour your nose
2:43this will add definition to your face
2:51the nail polishes that I used here is by nail teeny i recommend using a sparkling
2:55gold red or oxblood nail polish finish off the lips with the dark vampy glass
2:59here i'm using the daredevil color my moxie
3:07if you really want to pull off this look you want to try and keep your hair up
3:10and where the right outfit
3:11makeup is half the battle look for a lace dress and faux fur coat and this is
3:16the type of makeup - we're on our first tape
3:18it's kind of more if you want to catch someone's attention because it's
3:21beautifully bold good lack
0:00yeah
0:06yeah
0:35to get this beautiful hypnotic look have your face foundation ready and let's
0:43move straight into the eyes
0:44select a lilac eyeshadow color and apply this color on the outer corners of your
0:49eyes
0:49blend around this area and try to keep the rest of the eye area clean next step
0:55take a black sparkling color and sculpt this color on your crease and lower lash
0:59line
1:05with your blending brush blend everything out to create a subtle smokey
1:10effect
1:13load up your brush with the silver color and run this along the inner lower lash
1:18line
1:19this will help brighten up the eyes now take the silver glittering eye shadow
1:24color and with your finger
1:26just dab it on the center of your lids this will give your eyes a glamorous
1:30look
1:33and from here on up you can add more of the black eyeshadow to intensify your
1:38eyes
1:39just be sure to blend everything away you want this look to be extremely soft
1:43and hazy
1:44no hard edges with the smaller brush loaded up with a black eye shadow and
1:49line this on your waterline
1:50this will help give your eyes and edgy look
1:54and once you're done with the waterline just take your favorite black eyeliner
1:58here i'm using our liner and line your eyes
2:01I like to start with a thinner line and then taper out to exaggerate the shape
2:05of my eyes
2:06also don't forget to line your lower lash line halfway to balance out the
2:10shape of your eyes if you line it all the way it can sometimes make your eyes
2:14appear smaller
2:30yeah
3:11and now it's time for the lashes my lashes are not only thin but they grow
3:15straight down so i have to give him a lift
3:21when it comes to building up my lashes I prefer to use a two-step process where I
3:27use a mascara base to thicken and lengthen my lashes
3:31now that my lashes are nicely marinated with the CIL's booster
3:36I can now use my Hypnose star mascara this brush is really nice because one
3:41side is flat helping deposit a generous amount of product on my lashes
3:45while the other side is round which helps separate and lengthen my lashes
3:49this is going to give me a glossy finish so it's perfect for this look
3:59and now that my eyes are finished we can move on to the face
4:04since i'll be wearing a mask I'm going to contour my face first
4:09and then apply blush on my cheeks
4:12try not to add too much because it might overwhelm the face
4:18because we want more focus on the eyes just finish off with a light lip color
4:24tell me and now for the finishing touch
4:30yeah
4:36yeah
4:52yeah
4:54yeah
5:02yeah
5:12yeah
5:13yeah
5:24see
5:48good luck everyone
0:00got a casual date coming up no worries because i'm going to show you how to get
0:03the right makeup look
0:05nails what you're packing your bag and of course some fashion tips for your
0:08casual date night look at this thing and then was brewing
0:12let's start with a fresh face using the Marabella eyeshadow in semi formal
0:18it's a shimmery autumn brown color and using my soho smudger brush or use a
0:23dense dome shaped brush load up your brush with the brown color and apply
0:26this color on your legs and lower lash line then blend everything out
0:31applying a brown color all over your legs and lower lash line is a great way
0:35to help create a smoky look to your eyes
0:37taking a dark deep plum eye shadow line your lower and upper lash line with this
0:42color and then blend away
0:45remember try not to like the top part of your eyes
0:48we want the eyes to be a little bottom heavy for this casual look
0:53we don't want your eyes to look too bright we kind of want them to have
0:56almost like a sleepy look I know that sounds a little weird but honestly it's
1:00one of the few times and advocating a sleepy look next step
1:04carlashes some of you who don't need a corner lashes are so lucky my lashes
1:09grow straight down so i have two columns and then apply generous coats of mascara
1:15I like to do this trick where I take the mascara juan and hold it vertically and
1:20I give my lashes a few good swipes then afterwards I like to comb it through
1:24horizontally
1:26it really helps get more product on my lashes this trick is a great way to make
1:30it look like you're wearing eyeliner for the face
1:33finish it off with bronzer and blush personally i like to use bronzer first
1:38to sculpt and contour my face and then I like to use blush to add color
1:44and now we can finally move on to lips i'm going to use a bright pink lip gloss
1:48the one I'm using is by James cosmetic sparkle gloss and now that the makeup is
1:53done i'm finally going to show love to my hair my hair has been so dry so I'm
1:58going to use a split and repairing product called Carol's Daughter monoi
2:01repairing split end sealer
2:03it seals 93.3 percent of split ends by binding the separated ends of the hair
2:09keep in mind that trimming a hair is very crucial if you want it to be
2:12healthy
2:13however if you don't have time or you need that extra length for a special
2:17occasion
2:17this is a great product to use you can apply this product on wet or dry hair it
2:23will instantly feel nourished and now that my makeup is done
2:26it's finally time to dress up because my clothes are so simple just likings and a
2:32black oversized to it
2:33I decided to dress up my look by wearing this knee high boots
2:36it also helps toughen up the look my boots and bag are from justfab.com if
2:41you really like the boots and bag that I'm wearing here
2:44they're both for thirty nine dollars and ninety-five cents each on justfab.com
2:47when it comes to my bag
2:49it's important to pack my essentials I never leave the house without a
2:52concealer palette just case for touch-ups and of course a powder brush
2:56and press powder to keep my face shine free eyeliner both pencil and liquid for
3:01touch ups or if I want to intensify my eyes later on during the night
3:05lash curler to perk up my lashes during the night a smudger brush lip balm and
3:10of course my lip gloss
3:12I always make sure to carry water or drink in my bag
3:15it's really important to stay hydrated last but not least some restaurants will
3:20only accept cash
3:21so it's better to play it safe than sorry oh wait I forgot to show you my
3:24nail tutorial I'm keeping this look really simple and pretty
3:28using three of my favorite colors I'm going to make a few dots and with a
3:32brush soaked in nail polish remover dab it on the dot
3:35you'll notice right away that the nail polish remover is dissolving the drops
3:39of color
3:40keep having it around this will create a beautiful watercolor effect
3:45it's really important to apply top coat on top of your base color before adding
3:49the color drops or else the nail polish remover will dissolve your base color
3:53repeat the same steps to all your nails just have fun with it and when you're
3:57done just apply top coat and now your watercolor nails are finished and
4:02finally i'm ready to head out
4:04here's my outfit knee high boots are very in for autumn since the boots are
4:08so edgy with all the buckles
4:10I decided to pair it with my casual 10 bag to balance out the edginess of the
4:14boots
4:14ok now it's time to eat I give huge props to any restaurant with purse hooks
4:19I don't like having my back on the floor i recommend finding a sushi restaurant
4:22near university because they tend to be a little cheaper sushi restaurants are
4:27so fun because it requires you to share a menu with your date
4:31so you can talk and be really interactive with your date instead of
4:34just sitting there twiddling with your thumbs
4:36sushi is also very healthy you can eat a lot and not feel so bad
4:41and if you don't eat fish sushi restaurants usually carries chicken and
4:44vegetable tempura dishes
4:46this is actually how I break apart my chopsticks always breaks evenly and this
4:52is how I hold my chopsticks
4:54how do you guys hold your chopsticks do you hold it my way or his way
5:00salmon is my favorite fish and I love getting a spicy tuna handle
5:04what's your favorite thing to order the sushi restaurant to all the ladies out
5:07there if you can handle the bill
5:09do your thing but if you can
5:11trying to attempt to offering to help pay such a friendly gesture
5:15other than that just be yourself he should like you for you good luck and
5:19have fun on your date

1:38yeah i know but if this is a little too much for you
1:43I have another nail trick that you can mess around with that's a little more
1:46subdued i like to call it drip nails so get your colors ready and with a regular
1:51pencil just make random slowly marks like this
1:54you want to keep making these worlds with different colors
2:01basically just keep the drip pattern keeps swirling everything around
2:05think like a marble does that even make sense
2:09it may appear really thick looking on your nails but don't worry because it's
2:13going to dry them who is me
2:15you have to
2:17that's my
2:18kiss
2:20you're hot despite
2:27dip the pencil into the white nail polish and give it one last swirl and
2:32that's it
2:33once it's completely dry just top code it and you're pretty much ready to go
2:38alright so now for the makeup start out with your naked face
2:42yes I said naked I'm starting off with skincare first now with skincare i'm
2:47using equal 0 cellular activator facial serum first
2:50you know what the same it's a long name is going to work so what I'm using here
2:53is a serum basically a sara is like a liquid specialist they basically address
2:58specific needs some can be for wrinkles firming age spots whitening
3:03hyperpigmentation scars
3:05whatever it is there's a serum for it the molecule in serums are much smaller
3:09than the moisturizers molecule which means you want to use it right away
3:13because it will penetrate deeper and deliver all the goodness into your skin
3:17and don't forget to apply your moisturizer after sarren because you
3:20want to hydrate your skin even if you have oily skin
3:23you still have to use a moisturizer try using an oil free formula instead
3:28fun fact about this Brandi close it's actually a plant-based skincare line and
3:32their ceremony boys riser here has stem cells
3:35plant stem cells to be exact I wouldn't put human stem cells on my face
3:41all right moving on to sunscreen
3:44you're going to need at least SPF 15 so show your skin some love and protect it
3:50next step a little bit of foundation use it to even out your skin tone
3:56I know you guys keep hearing these sailors but I'm a huge believer that
4:00less is more
4:01far beyond the mismatch of person
4:05ah and using a sponge will help blend your foundation giving you that flawless
4:10airbrushed look please any next step using mineral powder again
4:18so when I was in Australia a really sweet subscriber name in gave me this
4:23amazing miracle in a red tube called luca's papa
4:27did I say that right guys anyways I love this stuff
4:30it's amazing you know what time it is everyone its brow time
4:35get in there and groom your brows nicely shaped browse will give your face more
4:39balanced
4:40this is bound to get messy but I don't care
4:45all right ladies you want to invest in a good neutral eyeshadow palette because
4:49the color taupe will go a long way using a brush or a sponge applicator apply
4:55this foolproof color as close to the lash line as possible and then the lower
4:59lash line
5:00taupe is a great contour shade it helps bring more dimension to your eyes and
5:05now it's time for the pretty eye shadow color using salty cosmetics loose
5:08eyeshadow powder in glamazon would focus around the inner corners of the eyes
5:13first
5:14it should be concentrated here and then blend out just a bit
5:19yeah
5:22the top was gonna need a little bit of that glamazon way to you see how subtle
5:26this makeup is it just comes to show you that you don't always need crazy colors
5:30to make a statement
5:33and whatever is left over on your brush or sponge brush it on your brow bone
5:38depending on your comfort level use a liquid liner to line your eyes
5:42the reason why I'm such a huge fan of liquid liners is because they tend to
5:46last longer
5:47that's what you're going to need for a long school day so line your eyes and
5:50draw another line to create fake lashes like this
5:53now it's time to curl your lashes and apply your favorite mascara you want to
5:58use waterproof mascara if your eyelids are oily or if you live in a really
6:02humid climate
6:06and cut the lower lash line ever using a waterproof formula
6:12me all right I sure does and now it's time for blush I'm using this creamy
6:18blush i bought at target
6:19apply a paint brush color around the apples of your cheeks
6:22usually when I wake up I look super pale so i need to add a little bit of life
6:27back into my face blush is the answer
6:32yeah
6:35and here i have to meet her roll on perfume oil so you're probably wondering
6:39what's your perfume oil perfume oils are the scented ingredient that gives
6:43regular perfumes colognes soaps shampoos Kendall's their smell perfume oil has
6:48you know alcohol so won't irritate the skin it will last longer because the
6:52alcohol can dilute the scent of the perfume you want to apply this on your
6:56wrist behind your ear and neck area
6:59mmm i love smelling good ok i'm almost done but I need your help i need you
7:04guys to help me pick a lip gloss color to finish off this look which one should
7:08I choose first one second one third one
7:11yes no maybe so still waiting guys guys I know you can choose a color and help
7:18me
7:19but if you're indecisive and it's okay because I'm always like that then I'm
7:24just going to use a pink lip gloss
7:26my mother didn't really allow me to wear makeup until I was in high school
7:30however i was allowed to wear lip gloss all right i hope you guys enjoyed this
7:34tutorial good black music by mari a dick be and let me know if there's any
7:39details that you like for me to film i'll be uploading new videos every
7:43Monday and Thursday
0:00so it's you me and a solo left also cad
0:08hi everyone i'm going to show you how to create the cyber gothic anime look it's
0:12perfect for four states interviews weddings
0:14that is if you're living in an enemy world get your headphones ready because
0:18this look
0:19might take a while to recreate i'm going to start out with my poor reducing
0:22primer and apply this on any wrinkly poorest area on your face
0:27this is going to smooth out any of your fine lines and fill in your pores to
0:30create a smooth canvas to work on with the liquid foundation that's a few
0:34shades lighter than your own skin color . the foundation all over your face
0:38yep keep going more a little mark stop here and a little here
0:46how do you think that looks good now let's . a few more haha just kidding
0:52yeah
0:57take your blending sponge and blend out the foundation sponges are wonderful
1:02tools that's great for blending and creating stuff looks
1:08with your favorite concealer to conceal any blemishes dark circles
1:14watching us anime girls have perfect skin and since no one really has perfect
1:19skin
1:19unless your baby you want to pack that concealer on your place with your powder
1:26set your makeup by powdering the foundation and concealer
1:33yeah
1:34powder helps set any texture that's moisture wet
1:38that's not dirty
1:48all right time for eyeshadow yes
1:51my favorite part using a luminous eyeshadow dab this all over your crease
1:56area aluminous eyeshadow adds color to your eyes without making it look like
2:01you're wearing eye shadow
2:05and with a copper color apply this shade on your crease and follow the natural
2:09contour on your eyes
2:11notice how this creates dimension to the eyes we all know your eyes already have
2:15dimension but with makeup or exaggerating it using a matte taupe
2:20color keep intensifying the contour of your eyes until you've reached that
2:24level of definition that you're satisfied with
2:27ok and now it's time to draw on your eyes if you're good at drawing anime or
2:34manga
2:35this will be easy peasy using a creamy black pencil eyeliner make sure it's
2:40creamy because we don't want the pencil to drag on your eyes right above your
2:44crease start drawing the outline of your anime I shape it should look like this
2:49a cat eye shape but way above the crease line
2:55take your matte black eyeshadow and start coloring in if you're good at
3:03coloring inside the lines as a child
3:05this should be no problem for you
3:10start sketching out anime lower lashes should be chunky and pointing
3:17and don't forget the upper lashes
3:20they should be skinny and pointing there are hundreds of different enemy I shapes
3:24that you can use if you need to use reference photos of anime or manga to
3:29help you find the one that fits your eye shape best
3:40hey don't play with the makeup take a bright color choice i decided to use a
3:44vivid purple color for this one
3:46apply the bright color along the upper and lower lash line of the eyes and
3:51softly blend it
3:52leave the middle part empty because if you fill it in it might look a little
3:56too dark and gothic
4:08with a champagne color dab a bit of this highlighter along the lower lash line to
4:15brighten up the eyes for this look it's all about making the eyes look bigger
4:20next step
4:23curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for mascara using your favorite
4:27mascara like my matches the color of my eyeshadow apply generous coats on your
4:32lashes keep building up your lashes you want sky-high lashes
4:37and if you still need help finish off the eyes with fake lashes break your
4:42lashes in so they're not too stiff
4:44kind of like breaking into your new jeans you know what to do apply glue and
4:47stick them on
4:53we're not done yet with your brow pencil failing your browser like you normally
4:59do
5:02but before you finish take an eyeliner pencil in the similar shape to your
5:09bright eyeshadow color my hair is purple and fill in your brows colored browse
5:14intensify the colors of your eye shadow
5:22with the matte bronzer or a matte taupe eyeshadow concert the sides of your nose
5:31this will make your nose look more skinny using a matte white eyeshadow
5:36apply this as highlighter and apply along the bridge of my nose to create an
5:41illusion of a taller knows
5:44also apply this on the high point of your cheeks to bring out your cheekbones
6:01and with the bronzer you all know the deal
6:04contour your cheeks and add more definition to the face
6:09yeah
6:13and apply natural looking blush to add softness back into your face
6:27for the lips i'm going to use a nude lip liner because I'm going to make my lips
6:31look smaller by reducing the size of my lips
6:34I'm going to do this by erasing the edges of my lips the more you erase the
6:38outline of your lips
6:39the smaller your lips look your new lip pencil should be as close to your skin
6:43color as possible
6:46blend the pencil until you don't see any marks
6:51afterwards take a pink lips take and with a brush
6:55load it up and add the color on the center of your lips
6:58you want your lips to look softer and delicate because enemy lips are usually
7:02just a thin line
7:03you don't want the edges of your lips to appear too sharp keep in mind that the
7:07smaller and delicate your lips look the larger your eyes will look and if you
7:12really want your eyes look bigger
7:13pop on your enemy eyeballs also known as circle lens
7:18I been an aide you need that we were done with brush em last step
7:23finish up with the hot pink blush to give you that sweet finish now I look
7:29flying

4:09away the baked underneath my eyes
4:14[Music]
4:19this shouldn't come as a surprise but a
4:23first timing my eyelids to make the look
4:25last all day long
4:27using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I
4:30mean yeah you can try a different primer
4:32I just know that soft ochre ensures me
4:36of having my look on all night for all
4:39day long so i change it up for the
4:41crease and outer corner and going in
4:43with her beauty's rose gold palette in
4:46the shade sandalwood but please trust me
4:49when I say you can use any media warm
4:52brown it doesn't depend which brand just
4:54make sure it's a mat warm medium brown
4:58and I'm starting off by placing most
5:01intensity on the outer corner here
5:05touching the lid and the police to start
5:08making little circle motions to blend it
5:11out and as your blending work your way
5:13up higher up into your crease from there
5:18you can lightly swipe it into the center
5:23of the crease and all I'm doing is soft
5:27circle motion
5:29you know you want to think of it as
5:30whenever you want to blend something out
5:32you want to create circle motions think
5:35of it as the wheels of the blending
5:38brush go round and round then once you
5:41have most definition apply to the outer
5:43portion of the I now you can swipe
5:45whatever is the left in the brush to
5:48work the inner portion of decreased but
5:50dude is very softly and not to hajj now
5:53with a more dense concentrated brush and
5:56that same color really build up
5:59definition on that out of fun here we're
6:02not focusing on the crease here just on
6:04this outer portion super easy just
6:07focusing on that outer portion and
6:09leaving everything else behind now going
6:11to go in with this color pop super shock
6:14shadow this looks amazing and it's in
6:17the color glitterati and you can choose
6:19to apply this color with your fingers or
6:21with the brush and then he is both i
6:23like using my fingers to kind of stamp
6:25the product down onto my lid and then
6:27with the brush I refine the shape
6:30this may be a simple look but i still
6:34want to catch all the attention so over
6:36top of the colour-pop product i'm
6:39applying this Maybelline eye shadow in
6:41the color New York silver for maximum
6:44impact of that shady you want to tap the
6:47product onto the lid so see how I'm not
6:52swiping the brush at all I'm tapping it
6:54up and down this is to get the maximum
6:56coverage of my eyeshadow as a base on my
7:03inner corners are using this mix
7:05lingerie I tint and going over top using
7:08this
7:08inglot pure pigment and number 75
7:11blinding first laying down that cream
7:15product to really make that highlight
7:17pop stick go over top using the link now
7:28I personally obsess over strong inner
7:31corner highlights they just hope that
7:33just made me warm on the inside but if
7:35you feel like that is too much simply go
7:37in with a little q-tip kind of rub the
7:41surface of the highlight to tone it down
7:43and it should become a lot more soft for
7:48the lower lash line and going back in
7:50with that medium brown color from the
7:51crease and applying it to the outer
7:54third of my lower lashline only using a
7:56flat definer brush and we use that flat
8:00definer brush to really pack on the
8:02color and to get it there and then we go
8:04in with a pencil brush to blend and
8:06smoke it out
8:11and by keeping that definition on the
8:16outer portion of the lower lashline only
8:18it will open up the eyes in such a
8:21beautiful flattering way but it won't
8:23drag them down to make him look too
8:24heavy a little bit of white Michael on
8:27the waterline and now all we have to do
8:31is apply some fun flirty lashes these
8:34Arlena lashes in the style Naomi and a
8:39lot of people always ask me how you can
8:41master applying false lashes and in the
8:45screen here i will show you a video that
8:48create a long time ago is not the
8:50technique that he used today anymore but
8:52it definitely helped me getting into a
8:54pine false lashes a lot better so that's
8:56a great way of starting out and in the
8:59screen here you can click the video and
9:00check it out
9:07all right to contract today I'm going to
9:11go in with the makeup geek contouring
9:13powder

9:16this one is called a breakup and I know
9:19these are super super pigmented so you
9:21only need the tiniest bit you know find
9:27the top of that cheekbone and go right

1:01alright so since we want to look glowing
1:03and moisturised and a beautiful for
1:06things giving the first thing I'm gonna
1:08go in with is Kim ties and wonder lush
1:10in collaboration with ofra again this is
1:13a test or form I've been with her
1:15through this process since the beginning
1:17so I'm this is not the final but its not
1:20its final form but this moisturizer is
1:24just amazing it leaves a glow it leaves
1:26you looking beautifully taking care of
1:29it's just life and more ah the life
1:33right now for foundation I'm going to go
1:35into a new product this is x la girl and
1:39this is called the pro coverage HD along
1:42where illuminating foundation it looks a
1:45lot like makeup forever i have the color
1:49porcelain right here but they also came
1:53out with a 1l a girl yes yes and yes you
1:59are representing as ghosties out there i
2:02love this i love this you can lighten
2:03any foundation or concealer with this i
2:06love that this is perfect what it's so
2:08revolutionary thank you for breaking the
2:11rules
2:11thank you got that coverage
2:20oh god only girl I see you it has a
2:25lovely dewy finish did have averaged now
2:34if only they could just follow their own
2:37revolution every break of rules by doing
2:40a white concealer as well that will
2:43really make my day I will say though the
2:46foundation remains very wet like do you
2:51see how it's almost what like I have wet
2:54skin like I'm sweating I'm not sure if
2:56I'm the biggest fan of that I kinda like
2:58it when it sets down and becomes a
3:00little bit more dry this is still very
3:03very wet for concealer gonna go in with
3:05the kat von d lock-it concealer creams
3:09in l1 and l3 and I've heard that these
3:14are a little bit more dry so trying to
3:17counteract the wetness of the foundation
3:19with the dryness of the concealer
3:32let's see if this will make it a perfect
3:38mixture of wet and dry
3:48and now going to set my under eye area
3:50to prevent it from creasing
3:59all right now to set the rest of my face
4:01using the Maybelline better skin
4:03super-state powder in 10 but my fear is
4:07with really wet foundations when you set
4:10it with powder it kind of moves the
4:11foundation right before you said it
4:14leaving it looking very disrupted and
4:17like messy so my fear is that that will
4:19happen so before i go in with my powder
4:22just make sure that it's in parish
4:24they're ready to be set with powder
4:27you guys are so sad I had such high
4:33hopes for this foundation once I first
4:36applied it I got so excited because it
4:38has beautiful coverage but it just
4:40remains so wet
4:43alright so the first thing I'm doing as
4:45always is priming using my soft or group
4:48in pot by Mac
4:56and now going to go in with the hoodie
4:58Beauty rose gold palette and going in
5:01first with the color shy or just
5:03blending this into the crease to build
5:06our definition and as a transition color
5:11for all the Jets and darkness that will
5:15come in later and for this look we're
5:17going to go all the way into the inner
5:20crease and all the way out
5:28now using the color bossy i'm going to
5:32deepen and intensify that and again
5:40taking this from inner to outer corner
5:43now to really cut the crease we're going
5:46to cut the lid by using Pro Longwear
5:48concealer by mac and with this we're
5:51going to really clean up the lid going
5:53right up against that crease color to
5:55cut it
6:06and I'm gonna set that all using angelic
6:20now I'm going to blend and smoke out
6:22that crease just at a bit more using a
6:24mix of bossy and man-eater all right now
6:33going to create a wing using my Tom Ford
6:35I defining pen in deeper
6:38from there you want to create your basic
6:44wing and filling in using my favorite
6:49MAC liquid last liner in black
7:03and now from that wing i'm going to
7:05swoop one clean line into the cut crease
7:09and now you want to softly buff black
7:16above that wine to give it a night
7:18planned
7:27for the lower lash i'm going to go back
7:28in with bossy and just smoking up that
7:31outer lower lash line and then on the
7:37inner corner
7:38I'm going back in with angelic and as a
7:44transition right in between going in
7:46with henna going into this beautiful
7:54Murphy highlighting palette and taking
7:57the two pink shades to highlight my
8:00inner corner
8:05all right all we need not to finish off
8:07our lashes and i'm going to go in with
8:10the any 22 snobby lashes and for my
8:18lower lashes are going to be using the

0:58then people cheering alright so the
1:00first thing I'm gonna do for this
1:02perrie edwards makeup look is moisturize
1:04my face to get a nice base to work with
1:07and I'm going to be using this little
1:09magic pot right here this is a new /
1:12product that will be launching january
1:14second and it's in collaboration with
1:17one of my best friends Kim Tae
1:19congratulations baby and this is still a
1:21tester form because I've been trying to
1:23smush Ty's are out for a couple of
1:25months now and I fallen in love with it
1:28and i not only love it as a moisturizer
1:30I think it is perfect to use as a base
1:34underneath your makeup because it really
1:36makes any product that you put over top
1:38grab onto it and really adhere to the
1:41skin so I think it's a great makeup base
1:44and that's why I'm using it today and no
1:46this will not be the final packaging i
1:48cannot even begin to tell you how good
1:51it is to finally be able to talk about
1:53this can let me try this
1:57I think three months ago and I've been
2:00obsessed ever since but I couldn't talk
2:01about it now I finally can
2:05love this stuff for foundation I'm going
2:08to be using this one by Mac this one is
2:10called the pro longwear nourishing
2:12waterproof foundation i'm in the color
2:14and see 15 and this was also the
2:16foundation that her makeup artist used
2:19for her for the music video and i'm
2:21applying this using my Beauty Blender
2:23dog
2:37and for concealer today I'm gonna go in
2:39with the urban decay naked skin
2:41concealer and the color fair neutral and
2:48of course also blending it in order to
2:50render a I'm trying to step away from
2:56using the top shape concealer but after
3:00using the shape tape for so long and
3:02then stepping back to another one it's
3:04just such a disappointment like nothing
3:06in my eyes can compare to shoot at this
3:09moment but nothing and now i'm going to
3:12set my under eye area with powder to
3:15prevent throne creasing that's just that
3:22the rest of my face and go in with this
3:24maybelline superstay better skin powder
3:27i discovered this in New York and ever
3:30since I've been in love with it it just
3:32beautifully sets your makeup and keeps
3:35it on all day long plus it's affordable
3:38I am really really really obsessed with
3:41this one
3:48ok now with Max shivering white powder
3:51going to highlight my under eye area
3:53using this new brush that I've been
3:55really really liking it's the stigma
3:57bake kabuki f-89 brush and I think it's
4:01the perfect size and width and density
4:05for the under eye area to just
4:07flawlessly apply that on your highlight
4:09or just do or just to set your bank or
4:12get rid of your it's just a really
4:14really good under eye brush see it's
4:24pervert already i'm going to do my
4:26eyebrows off camera and then we'll be
4:28back before i do anything on the eyes
4:30and the Prime to make this look last all
4:33day long and this is my mac soft ochre
4:35Paint Pot
4:41the first color I'm going to go in with
4:44is by the morphe 35o em paulo and
4:47discovered here is going into my crease
4:50and we're software going to focus this
4:52more towards the insight crease so see
4:56how I'm pulling focus right here on that
4:59inner crease that's where you want to go
5:03don't your fridge google high up in that
5:07crease if you have a lot of space to
5:09work with use it now hopping over to
5:15this shape right here for more
5:16definition but softer definition in the
5:19crease we're just continuing defining
5:22that crease we just don't want the color
5:26to be as dark and intense on this outer
5:29portion here we want the focus to go
5:31here on that increase
5:44now with the darkest color of the
5:46palette i'm going to define that
5:48increase even more so we're creating a
5:51cut crease definition here and although
5:55we haven't cut the crease really once we
5:58go in with the lip color and really go
6:01against that line it will look as if we
6:04had a couple is going on all the time
6:06and what this i think you can see that i
6:09really mean that we want all the
6:11definition to be a met in our cruise
6:14right here
6:15don't be afraid to go all the way in
6:17hopping over to the morphe 35o shimmer
6:21pallid and taking the very lightest
6:24color to cut the lid and you'll see by
6:26me going right up against that line of
6:28the crease it will give you that cut
6:30crease illusion and continue blinding
6:37that lid using that same shade and also
6:43highlighting the inner corner using that
6:45same shade using a combination of the
6:50two crease colors i'm slightly defining
6:53the outer V for the waterline first
6:56going to go in with these you ways limb
6:58cream eyeliner in matte black
7:10and then taking the darkest color from
7:13the crease again from morphe 35o and
7:16palate and smoking it out and then we're
7:21also bringing that out slightly for my
7:29wing today our first lining out using
7:30the tongue forward I defining in deeper
7:40and fill in using my favorite MAC liquid
7:43last liner all right now with black
7:51shadow is really important to diffuse
7:53and smoke out the outer corner of that
7:56liner and kind of like it out as well so
7:58that is exactly what we're doing with
8:05the pencil brush I'm softly smoking back
8:08out little by little until becomes
8:11beautiful Hayes same sort of like that
8:17nice and smoky for lashes i'm going to
8:20go in with one of my all-time favorite
8:22styles these are be Lily lashes in the
8:25style tease and for the little star I'm
8:29putting down a little bit of lash glue
8:31and then sticking the start right over
8:33top
8:40alright first for cheeks let's do a
8:44little bit and by a little i mean a lot
8:46of contouring I found out about this new
8:49product right here this is my Road aisle
8:51and it's the instant glam compact deluxe
8:56contouring powder and number three and
8:59this is what it looks like
9:00and honestly if you're using it in New
9:02York with Maybelline and it just it has
9:05changed my world you only need a tiny
9:08bit of it it has the perfect color to
9:11make it look like a shadow as an actual
9:14contour as opposed to like a warm brown
9:17muddy mess and I've been really really

9:21use today to contact with oh I honestly
9:31want to look so pinch and so singed and
9:35so pull together i'm going in with the

9:50i love that I love it when is the artist
9:52that just upset over glam like I do is

12:57see you guys on the next one
0:00hey guys today I'm doing a review /
0:02tutorial on the new kylie jenner
0:05burgundy pallid this recently came out
0:08and no one kindly during its probably
0:11blowing up the internet but this is what
0:14this gorgeous little creature looks like
0:16now personally before i start off this
0:19got sent to my mom's home address and
0:21every Kylie product i've talked about in
0:24the past before i have bought with my
0:26own money and got sent to this place
0:28right here where i live and i went to my
0:30mom's place and she was like you have a
0:32package so i opened the package up and
0:34it turn out to be highly Jenner and I
0:37was like oh how did she get that address
0:39but I think it's so cool that Kylie sent
0:42me her fall collection now of course
0:44when you are positive about kylie jenner
0:46a lot of people think you're being
0:47bought or you sold your soul or that
0:50you're being sponsored not trust me
0:52Kylie has not sponsored any of my videos
0:54she sells a bunch
0:56she sells enough product without my
0:59support so no Kylie didn't sponsored my
1:02last video she isn't sponsoring this one
1:04and trust me with the FCC rules
1:06I it will be illegal for me not to tell
1:08you if this was sponsored so let's get
1:11that out of the way now let me tell you
1:13about the bronze palette the bronze
1:14palette wasn't really my cup of tea
1:18I love the colors but my main issue with
1:20that palette was that the shimmers were
1:22really not kind of shimmery and the mats
1:25i found that the more you blended them
1:27on your I they all turn out to be the
1:29same color so I wasn't a huge fan of
1:31that pallet now this one however hope
1:33ball i created these very grungy
1:36warm-toned smokey eyes for fall and i
1:39must say i am really impressed with this
1:41palette the palate looks like this and
1:43of course the tears have the colors in
1:45chrome of what's inside
1:48not this is what the inside looks like
1:49it comes with nine shadows which are
1:5312345 maths and for shimmers it still
1:57doesn't include a mirror although Kylie
2:00has set herself on her snapchat that the
2:02next palette will have a mirror and
2:04honey for $42 mirror
2:07yeah we have nine alisios cranberry
2:11warm fall rich I shadows and I
2:16personally I love these colors
2:18especially that metal 1 i'm running on
2:20the inner corners the Malaysian obsessed
2:22so yeah without any further ado let's
2:24hop right into the demo / tutorial on
2:28this look right here using the palette
2:29so you can see how the shadows work on
2:32my eyes how I like them i'll give you my
2:34feedback on every shape that i use and
2:36let's just get comfortable and relax and
2:39let's enjoy this kylie jenner bergen
2:42appellate review all right the first
2:43thing before he'd do anything with this
2:46palette is prime because i want this to
2:48last all day long
2:50this is my mac software her paint pot
2:58the first color gonna go in with is
3:01penny and I'm just defining my crease
3:04with this now as we can see the pigment
3:09on penny is in sane and I love the color
3:13I love the warm i love that orange tone
3:17would still looks it looks like a mat
3:19copper almost is crazy pigmented it
3:23blends into the socket like a dream with
3:27such ease obsessed with penny
3:31now i'm going to go into brick and
3:33defining my inner and outer corner for a
3:36halo smoky eye
3:38ok the pigment of the mats is insane i
3:46read into a couple of problems with the
3:48maps in the previous palette I just felt
3:50like once you blend everything together
3:52it all just kind of looked like the same
3:54color but this is pigmented a velvety
3:57smooth and it just it's so easy to work
4:00with
4:01[Music]
4:04I'm just going to smoke out and blend in
4:08the edges to give it a nice smooth
4:11gradient and to make sexy and seductive
4:16for this halo smokey eye and then a
4:18darkened the inner and outer corner even
4:21more using almond honestly you guys i am
4:27really impressed with the map for the
4:30center of the lid i'm going to go in
4:32with the color dubai okay okay yeah okay
4:36not okay this isn't a bad shadow
4:42I just feel like the consistency is very
4:45thin it's almost as if the shadow is
4:48really thin like it takes a little bit
4:51more effort and pressure to get the
4:53pigmentation of the shimmer to work and
4:57I mean once it's on it's stunning
5:00I just feel like it's it's where to
5:02explain but it's a very thin type of
5:04eyeshadow also not gonna lie i expected
5:07that color to be a little bit more
5:08chromatic and extreme so we're going to
5:11do is go over top with the bronze the
5:13bronze is called la and this is going
5:15right on the center of Dubai ok that is
5:22the stunning color but again I feel like
5:25the shadow itself is a thin shit it's so
5:30hard to swing it's a thinner shadow but
5:33I mean once it's on it is absolutely
5:35stunning and beautiful i just feel like
5:37it's a it's an odd texture for a shimmer
5:40I should because if it's quite fit for
5:42my lower lash I'm gonna go back into
5:43brick and smoke that baby out
5:55and for the inner portion of the lower
5:58lash I'm going to be applying burgundy
6:00oh my god this car
6:05yes ok it has a little bit of all out
6:08that colored oh oh my god its fall in an
6:13eyeshadow ok deepening the entire lower
6:16lash line using almond again and lastly
6:22going to highlight my inner corners
6:23using naked
6:25ok ok i know a lot of people are not the
6:31biggest fan of this color but I think
6:34heard up with all the beautiful warm
6:36tones this on the inner corners makes it
6:39so sultry and different I mean yes it's
6:42too dark for my skin tone but somehow i
6:44don't mind did weirdly enough though the
6:47texture and formula that feels away
6:49different than the other shimmers I used
6:51so this one feels a little bit more
6:53dense a little bit more easy to work
6:55with and Jessica lights on easier to
6:57finish off the look i'll be applying
6:58some falsies these are literally lashes
7:01in the style tease
7:05[Music]
7:14alright so eyes done my cheeks almost
7:16done i think we still need a bunch of
7:19glow for this look because the matter if
7:22its fall winter spring summer we need to
7:25go i'm gonna go in with my current
7:27favorite highlighter which is by morphy
7:29it's a pressed pigment and it's in the
7:31color champagne nights and its just oh
7:34it's everything so i am just go no blind
7:41and we can't forget about the tip of the
7:47nose
7:48you either loved it or hated I guess we
7:50know which team I'm on
7:52and to finish off this look I think it
7:54will only be fitting if I apply a Kylie
7:57lip kit color dirty peach page or mm-hmm
8:05from God
8:09let's do moon to make it super super
8:11fall in like
8:27all right just like that now we're going
8:28to do a little spritz of settings free
8:31to lock this into place and we call it a
8:34day and that guy's is how the kylie
8:42jenner burgundy paulo works on the eyes
8:46I overall think it's a really really
8:48cool palette I mean the shimmers do need
8:51a little bit more love when applying
8:53them but the man would talk about the
8:55mats the mats are absolutely insane
8:58they're smooth buttery painted and they
9:01are so easy to work with
9:02I am really really impressed by these
9:04maths my absolute favorite shade of the
9:06entire palette is penny it is just so
9:09rich and the ability to make it look
9:13like a mat copper is insane to me i love
9:16it so much so um yeah
9:18for me the kylie jenner burgundy palette
9:21gets a huge he has a highly recommended
9:24it is a pricey palette is $42 but i do
9:28think it's worth it as always i do want
9:30to just claim that makeup is a personal
9:32game something may work for you and it

0:09still very clean and easy and simplistic
0:11to do with the pressure on clean and
0:13simplistic because people have been
0:15demanding it from me and then of course
0:16I needed my touch of glam so I a dish
0:19that highlighter and glossy bronze
0:22metallic red lips yummy i am seriously
0:26obsessed with this look I think it
0:28screams ball i think it is so sexy and
0:32seductive and clean and simplistic and
0:34easy and you know that any forever do if
0:36you like to know how to get this look
0:37right here then please keep watching
0:40alright so the first thing I want to do
0:41for this fall Vybz makeup look is sort
0:45of prime not really going to apply a
0:46primer because I'm just filming this and
0:49then I'm taking it off and i'm going to
0:50sleep and then i'm going to the airport
0:52and going in with the touch of dewy skin
0:54missed and just going to spray and and
0:58soak up the moisture
1:03I'm gonna go in with the air flash
1:06foundation by dior and I am in the color
1:10100 now little side note this is the
1:12last time I'm giving this a shot
1:15I've tried this numerous amount of times
1:16and every time I tried it I absolutely
1:18hated it so I'm giving it one more shot
1:21and if I hated after this it's going to
1:23be no God oh it's gonna be one I don't
1:26care it's gonna be one so what I did in
1:28the past was kind of keep it at a
1:30distance and then spray myself and it
1:32would end up everywhere my shirt my
1:34hairline my nose hair browse ears teeth
1:38everywhere so not today today going to
1:40keep it very close to my actual face and
1:44tried to try and make this work
1:54what the brush on a blended in and hope
2:02for the best that are ready is one of
2:06the best tries its ever had on my face
2:08usually it would just go everywhere and
2:11not cover anything i would have to go
2:13layer upon layer upon layer right now
2:16that's a pretty damn girl i mean so many
2:21people love this foundation they're like
2:24it's my holy grill it makes my skin look
2:26at best it has amazing coverage and
2:29every time people would say that I'd be
2:31like fish well so what a lot of my
2:34friends do is use this as a base
2:36foundation and then go in with a classic
2:40foundation over top in areas that you
2:42needed so maybe I'm gonna have to get
2:45that shot because so far no no God no
2:49i'm not going to go in with my classic
2:51Foundation which is two-faced born this
2:53way and picking up a little bit more on
2:55my brush and in areas where i always
2:58prefer a little bit more coverage i'm
3:01going to apply that right on top of top
3:03of cheekbones just a thin layer which we
3:10all know is a lie because I don't work
3:12in layers can I just say this day is
3:14full of surprises or ready i use the air
3:17flash foundation because i always need
3:19it i wanted to give it one last shot
3:21same goes for this brush this is the
3:24morphe and 439 I usually never really

6:08transparent eel reflex make it stick for
6:11some lit clearly with glitter base just
6:14a very very thin layer and then let's
6:18get crazy
6:27oh I want to feel bathtub with the stuff
6:32and dunk my body in it right now to seal
6:34the deal i'm going to apply some falsies
6:36and today i'll be using my trusty Lily
6:39lashes in NYC
6:52alright we got these smoky mermaids
6:54swimming on our eyeballs but now it's
6:56time to snatch the face so first things
7:00first I'm going to contour my cheekbones
7:02because we are in need of some snatching
7:05this right now I'm gonna give you a pot
7:07with today I'm not going to contour
7:09using my morphe m530 this is my baby
7:11this is my everything but sometimes you
7:13gotta change it up a little bit today
7:15I'm gonna go in with this newest Sigma
7:17powder sweep f06 brush now I think this
7:21is meant to brush away baking or
7:23whatever you want with it but i think
7:25this is insane to contour with like
7:28insane and of course as always going to
7:30contour using my camera quantum medium
7:32sculpting powder so i'm going to pick up
7:34some on the brush and tap tap and I
7:38don't know how this brush does it but it
7:41has enough sturdiness and like denseness
7:47to it that it can really really like
7:49really accurately snatch that contour
7:53for you but then it also has this like
7:55flimsiness and softness to it to just
7:58effortlessly blend and define its it's
8:02insane
8:02this brush has been doing for me lately
8:04it's all I conduit they leave it is like
8:07now I just still going with my m4 44 by
8:10$OPERAND more feet with my face powder
8:12and clean up underneath around it and at
8:16the base
8:17same old same old I will always do this
8:20to make sure that my contour looks flow
8:26now I feel like we need a little bit of
8:28bronzer on our face today so I'm gonna
8:30go in with the chocolate soleil bronzer
8:31from the power of make a pallet and at
8:34first it's going to warm up my hairline
8:37very slightly because if I do this too
8:40much I look muddy and disgusting and
8:43then also just right at the contour to
8:46warm it up and diffuse it out and give
8:49yourself that tan and the very quickly
8:52without paying too much attention to it
8:54i'm going to contour my nose just a tiny
8:56bit using light sculpting powder by
8:58kevin kline
9:00[Music]
9:05[Music]
9:07just quick and easy just like that going
9:10to go in with a lady slipper or a powder
9:12which looks like this and my morphe and
9:15509 brush and I'm just going to pick up
9:17at any minute and really softly I'm
9:20gonna add a tiny teeny bit of color just
9:24very minimal she said she applied 10
9:29pounds of blush lived and never
9:33highlighter and then i use a new
9:34favorite this is citrine powder
9:37highlighter buy UA now citrine sold out
9:40like in a day but i will tell you that
9:42the darker one topaz is almost the same
9:46the only difference is that with topaz
9:49the base is just a tad bit warmer but
9:51citrine is the one that stole my heart
9:53so I'm going to use that today and i'm
9:55going to blind like a moment and then
10:03with this am also going to highlight my
10:05cubed bow and then with the tip of my
10:09ring finger I'm gonna pick up a little
10:11bit more and i'm going to highlight the
10:13tip of the bridge right right
10:24so when I was in Paris with issue way I
10:28wanted a super beautiful new lip but I
10:30wanted to give it like a twist so I went
10:33in with buff lip cream one of my
10:36all-time favorites because it's such a
10:38beautiful nude liquid lipstick that
10:41works i'm going to be a pine bluff first
10:52and now for that fun twist and to make
11:00it so much more mermaid and like sexy
11:03and uh I'm gonna go in with rose quartz
11:06highlighter buy UA this is this is

1:43fun glittery festive party look

2:09let's keep watching alright so let's get this glam look started i'm gonna drink
2:13my Beauty Blender in one of my favorite moisturizers and I'm gonna pick it up on
2:17that beauty blender and with this i'm going to moisturize my skin and what
2:22this will do is of course this will prep your face for foundation to make
2:26everything going smoothly and beautifully
2:30I'm just the way you want it but also because you're applying that foundation
2:35with your Beautyblender your Beautyblender will absorb some of that
2:38moisturizer and then once you start using it for your foundation it's going
2:42to mix in and create this lovely blend of a nourishing foundation and that will
2:48make your foundation go in even more beautiful
2:51it will just melt into the skin so nicely one of my favorite tricks to just
2:57transform a foundation into Photoshop skin for foundation today I'm going to
3:02go in with Too Faced Born This Way and i always use the color snow and pearl I
3:06mix them together to get the perfect match with that same beautiful
3:10understood dabbing it onto the skin
3:22yeah
3:25for concealer today i'll be going in with the tart shaped concealer in fair
3:30and to make it even lighter and go in with Kat Von D's a cream concealer in
3:35white out the heart really going to highlight with this is rach assistance
3:42is a very glam look
3:51and the whiteout just mixed into the tart one just dotting it in and same
4:03Beauty Blender and we're going to bounce that in
4:14I using mine are soft velvet loose powder and snow i'm going to bake my
4:18under eye area as always the first thing i'll be doing is the priming my eyelids
4:27using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and using Ivy I'm gonna set my brow bone to
4:37crease area to help lending later on with the two-faced sketch marker in
4:47black which is included in the kid first going to map out the outer shape of the
4:52eye from there with a precise angle brush and picking up the dark black from
5:01the palette called wanted and just shaping out that outer corner and
5:05filling the outer third in with that same brush and same color picking up
5:14some makeup and chill and with this I'm gonna blend from the black onto the lid
5:19and this is going mainly on the center of the lid blending in with that black
5:28now picking up painkiller and learning that right next to make up and chill
5:39going back in with ivy and really highlighting the inner third and inner
5:44corners
5:49now going to pick up makeup and chill and i'm going to create a new crease and
5:58make sure you have a little bit of room for some glitter with painkiller and
6:02make a potential and a fine liner brush I'm going to blow and blend that out
6:06even more and because it's such a small area and it can be a little tricky to
6:13blend it out would I like to do is place up eyeliner brush laughs onto my skin
6:19and with short strokes kind of drag it up to create a blend you can always go
6:27back in with makeup and chill only Andrea intensified the base of that new
6:31crease as a base for the glitter and to make the glitter go on even sparkly er
6:37I'm gonna grab Urban Decay's heavy metal glitter in glam rock and this is going
6:42right in between those two lines and quickly setting it with the glitter from
6:49the kit
6:56with the sketch mark liner and creating a basic wing
7:04for the bottom i'm taking makeup and chill and buffing it on the outer
7:09corners of my lower lashline and with painkiller I'm just continuing defining
7:16my lower lashline some what I call on the waterline and with the white liner
7:23i'm placing a little white dot on the inner corners of my eyes and to finish
7:27the look off i'm going to do is apply some lashes that these are goddess
7:30lashes by Coco lashes
7:41alright for cheeks the first going to cut them using my camera quan medium
7:49sculpting powder
7:57and with a delay 140 brush and just gonna intensify the base of that contour
8:03and lend it out and then grab your face powder in your face brush and go right
8:11underneath to clean the line or rounded and even right over top of the base of
8:18the contour to soften it that will give you really airbrushed perfect contour
8:25finish for blush I'm going to go into my power of make a pallet and mixing both
8:29blushes for a beautiful pinky coral and for a killer glow today i'll be using
8:40the sugar-coated from the palette this unfair skin tone as a highlighter is hi
8:50there
8:51no this is the stuff I live for
8:56let's not forget about that nose Cupid's for lepers going to hi Tom for nude
9:08vanilla because this nude is just it works with everything and I think the
9:12eyes are so special I want all the attention to go to hear
9:21and then over top will be applying the over metallic liquid lipstick in
9:27Versailles
9:34and to finish you want to lock this all in place with a setting spray and i'll

1:50tacky base to work with so I'm ready for foundation for foundation today i'll be
1:55using the girl and time proof foundation in the number to base Claire and I
2:00thought why not change it up for once I'm not going to use my beauty blender
2:03and then we use the brush it's been forever since i use a brush for my
2:06foundation and i'm going to use the morphe g36 brush
2:11all right then got that makes the foundation go on beautifully I was a
2:18little skeptical at first with having used a brush for condition forever
2:22again it looks good it's faster than a Beauty Blender - so I'm liking this
2:30and everybody like this more if you want i did in my first time trying it so I
2:33didn't know what to expect but it
2:35it's good i'm really excited about that but my base is a little bit too dark so
2:39I'm going to lighten it up with a little bit of concealer and by a little bit i
2:42mean a lot
2:43so the concealers that we go in with today are the urban decay naked skin
2:47concealer in fair neutral and amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
2:52so going in with amazing cosmetics amazing concealer
2:57first I am
3:04yeah
3:05all right never mind about the Urban Decay concealer I'm keeping it at the
3:10amazing concealer only and in my opinion nothing once concealer in like a Beauty
3:15Blender so for concealer i am using the Beauty Blender
3:25yeah
3:26yeah
3:30and with a loose powder I'm going to step my under eye area to prevent it
3:34from creasing
3:41and now grabbing my Armani luminous silk powder and my morphe m 4 44 and setting
3:47the rest of my face
3:54yeah
3:57and then for larger areas of my face and then switch over to the morphe be 54
4:02which I know the classic ii collection by morphy is discontinued they're no
4:07longer available
4:08but i also know they just came out with a brand-new line the early to collection
4:14which is basically the same brushes but better and i have yet to receive them i
4:18did order couple and once i have them i'll let you know what I think of it on
4:23snapchat and right here
4:24but for now i'm using my trusty old C 50 people and to highlight my under eye
4:29area and to brush away the baking going in with Max shivering white studio fix
4:34powder and i'm going to use a more fiji 35 to use this and I know these are hard
4:39to get by
4:40I personally got mine off of ebay because they couldn't find them in the
4:44stores anymore but maybe they're just so that and we'll come back but i don't
4:50know i don't
4:51and the best part about this is that it looks absolutely horrendous right now
4:56but once you do your contour blush highlight everything
5:01it will all just kind of melt in with each other and it will just look for
5:06eyes the first thing i'll be doing is applying a base of course to keep this
5:10eye on all day long and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot from this
5:21a little trick to make blending easier is applying a lighter matte eyeshadow
5:27from creasing brow bone area and this will just help lend anything you put
5:32over top so much so I'm doing that right now with a matte black eyeshadow first
5:37gonna wing out my lid and for this amusing morphy m1 6116 brush
5:44go ahead and fill that in and now we have a nice direction to go with for the
5:55rest of the lid to cut the little using the mac pro longwear concealer and a
6:00sigma l 05 brush and with this we're going to create our lid shape on the
6:08inner third i'm going to set that using Color rain Malibu eyeshadow and of
6:13course you want to stay inside that cut lip line
6:22yeah
6:23and on the center of the village this danessa Marik's metals pigment in sequin
6:34yeah
6:39yeah
6:43yeah
6:45not going to grab the more few 35p palette and taking this color right here
6:50and with a cara de 22 brush I'm going to cut right above that line to create a
6:55new crease
7:01and then now with a small little more fee fi 15 brush on a bus and blend that
7:10out
7:16and I know I say this all the time but the higher you get up the less pressure
7:21you want to put on the brush to make a beautiful blend you can always go in
7:28with a large brush to soften the edges and make it seamless on the water line
7:35will be upon these two for our contour inner rim gel liner in black and going
7:43back in with my morphe 35p palin and going into these two colors right here
7:48for the lower lash line using a sigma e 05 brush to apply it
7:59and then right at the outer corners you want to wing that purple out parallel to
8:03the wing and with Anasazi Beverly Hills pink heart i'm going to highlight my
8:12inner corners
8:16and also highlighting the brow bone
8:20for lashes today i'll be using the lily lashes in the style goddess
8:33all right let's move on to cheeks were cheating on a contra first because India
8:41is like sculpting to Collins
8:43I'm gonna go in with my makeup geek a breakup cool toned
8:47I'm gonna go in with my makeup geek a breakup cool toned contouring powder and
8:54my morphe and 5 30
9:05all right for blush I've been dying to show you this on camera i've already

9:47here and apply it using a more p.m. 509 brush it is super super pigmented so a
9:56little bit goes a long way
9:58trust me on this one so you definitely want to use a light hand because if you
10:03go too strongly
10:04you're gonna have a lot of clowns running for their money
10:07but hey I look like a car right now i love it i love my k-cup so who cares

11:13means India's cheeks look like a magical shining aura of light so i think we
11:19pretty much know that today
11:20all right for lips it's actually really easy just want a very neutral
11:24softly glossy lip so whenever I hear that I'm like okay we need something
11:28neutral effect extreme gloss but somehow my brains transformed the word neutral

1:21it onto my morphe beauty sponge
1:23I've tried the whole spring it on your face and it for me just get everyone
1:27gets my clothes get the my hair at one point I even felt like it accentuated my
1:31nose hair so you know the first you want to give it a shake and then now I'm
1:37going to spray it onto my morphe Beauty Blender this is my first time trying it
1:41out so let's see how it goes
1:45then apply and this will give you a very minimum weight of foundation on your
1:56face
1:57but it's still nicely balances it out see how that's super lightweight and
2:02totally doesn't cover anything at all
2:04who am i I'm not like this anymore well it is beautiful if you want to go for a
2:08really light coverage barely there makeup look
2:12this to me for here bomb

2:38alright so switching back to a Beauty Blender to see if I notice a difference
2:42and bouncing that traceless foundation stick my tongue forward into my skin
2:49I don't know guys I think it's pretty damn identical as far as what the sponge
2:54is due to my foundation or concealer going to go in with the colour-pop
2:58sculpting sticks in gummy bear and mix it with tart shape tape concealer in

3:57amounts of powder and you're left with like airbrushed flawless skin just like
4:02Kendall

4:34with this you also brush away the baked and you're left with beautiful
4:38highlighted under eyes that look crazy right now but in the end once you have
4:43your bronzer contour blush highlighter on it all just melts in together and
4:48it's amazing

0:00hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial with the beloved modern renaissance
0:05alibi on the sauce a Beverly Hills when I got this palette i'm going to be
0:08honest I was like a lot of red but then when it finally started playing with it
0:12i am in love with you
0:15I think the modern renaissance palace by Anasazi Beverly Hills is really really
0:19cool
0:20it has a bunch of warm red homes and warm Browns but its overseas highly can
0:25do so many looks with this so today i went for the super glam red smokey eyes
0:31with the pink touch and some glitter some humongous false lashes and metallic
0:36lips because I'm all about the metallic - lately because also in this video i'll
0:40be using a lot of new products some products I've never used on camera
0:44before but if love before and some products I've never tried so this video
0:48is going to be a wind of fresh air with new products on camera so i cannot wait
0:53to show you how i did this and if you want to know how I did this and keep
0:57watching
0:58alright so throughout today video i'll be trying a lot of new products and I'm
1:02so excited to share with you my first impressions
1:05so the first product i'm going to go in with is by benefit this right here is
1:08the total moisture facial cream
1:11this is my first time applying this on camera i've been using this for about
1:14two weeks now a real life and i'm really enjoying what it's doing for my face
1:21before applying makeup
1:23I wouldn't really use it as a moisturizer for my skin care but I do
1:27think it moisturizes the skin perfectly for makeup so i really like it for
1:32makeup moisturizing information today I'm going to go in with this girl and
1:36why
1:37and this is called to New the public's you on which is a high friends think
1:41that's what he called time proof foundation ultimate lasting perfection
1:44think I got the color to which I feel like this will be a little bit to turn
1:48out a little bit this will be too dark for me
1:50we're going to mix it with a lighter foundation something very new for me
1:54mmm this right here is an artiste brush and we all recognize our toothbrushes
1:59because they look like little like one of those showerheads and this right here
2:04is the fool went at overall number eight and i'm just going to pick up some of
2:08the foundation on the brush and with this you're just going to foundation
2:12phase up and that's where using the RTS brushes for your foundation is one of
2:19the fastest ways of doing your foundation because you literally just
2:23brush it on and the brush does all the work for you
2:26and what I find so amazing about these brushes is that they really give you the
2:31most coverage you could wish for in your foundation other brushes are like a
2:35Beauty Blender you get a lot of coverage but sometimes you feel like the brush or
2:39the product you're using to apply your foundation with it kind of takes away
2:44the pigmentation and coverage that the Foundation provides with this it just
2:49keeps the ultimate amount of coverage in the brush and you're just smear and
2:54apply it on and it does the work for you it's it's amazing for concealer i'll be
2:59trying two new ones today the first one is going to be x amazing cosmetics and
3:04this right here is the amazing concealer in ivory and then also the brand new
3:08heart shaped tape contour concealer in fair and then mix it to first going in
3:13with the amazing concealer on the inner part of my under eye
3:20that's why i love that print that appreciates us
3:24tasty ghosts out there and the tar concealer right here on the tops of my
3:30cheekbones and to blend it and i'll be using my new more feet
3:36beauty sponge I have no idea what this is called it the black one and I'm
3:40wondering actually knew sponges other than the beauty blenders always kind of
3:48scare me because the Beauty Blender is the only one that is like so soft and
3:53blend the concealer in like perfection
3:56so any other sponge kind of scares me because usually they're harder and more
3:59rough and they kind of take a way foundation and we like patches and holes
4:05in your base but so far this morphy one looks looks really good
4:09a moment of truth under eye area
4:18ok just looking beautiful so far
4:23to make i'll be using mine arse powder in snow and again I'm kind of afraid
4:28because with the beautiful you have like a nice tip to go underneath your eyes
4:32with the loot
4:34ok so not gonna lie
4:39really impressed with this it is harder to go underneath the eyes with this so i
4:44might not use it for powder but so far it's it's really nice
4:48now with a loose powder and my morphe e51 brush I'm going to try the alyssa
4:53ashley technique she picks up way too much powder douses it all over the face
4:58and busted in and then wife's i'll be excessive powder away so too much powder
5:02too much
5:08notes are roughing it in and that is how she sets the face to blend in my under
5:15eye area i'm going to go into the max shivering white powder and with this i'm
5:19just going to brush away the baked and highlight my under eye area
5:28the first thing i'll be doing as always is priming my eyes using this camp up by
5:33Mac called soft ochre with more face porcelain eyeshadow on the set my crease
5:41the brow bone area to help lending later on and doing so using a mac 252 brush
5:54let's dive into the Anasazi Beverly Hills modern renaissance
5:58hello I'm going to go in with the color bond fresco first and with a more fiemme
6:03504 brush
6:04I'm just gently applying that to the crease and slow and steady start adding
6:09more layers of fun fresco to create more depth
6:17you can always go back in with porcelain by morphy and that mac 252 brush and
6:22clean up the shape and the blending if you've gone too far up or you're just
6:28not feeling
6:29what are you seeing this is kind of your eraser all right now going into this
6:33beautiful color right here called Venetian red and with my favorite lower
6:38lashline brush this one is by morphy I talked about this and snapchat this is
6:41the end 508
6:43this is perfect to pack on color on the lower lash line
6:50from the palette i went in with red ochre and i'm using back here on the
6:54outer corner to meet in that crease and then with a little more fee fi 14 i'm
7:00just going to blend and both that in the outer corners
7:12now going in with a small synthetic angled brush and creating a new inner
7:18corner on the lower lash line
7:27to cut the lid I'm not going in with the mac pro longwear concealer in NC 15 and
7:33this is like cutting the crease but we already put a crease in so by cutting
7:37the lid you mimic a cut crease and to cut the lid of using a sigma lip lo5
7:43brush
7:52overtop i'll be applying for mirror of course you want to stay inside that cut
7:57lip line on the center of the little be applying this is you a pink pearl powder
8:05eyeshadow and on the inner third of the live i'll be applying the steel a
8:13metallic rose quartz
8:21quickly highlighting my inner corners using porcelain by morphy again
8:26all right and on the waterline this the for our colorful eyeshadow and liner in
8:33white
8:34all right all that is left to do now is the play some beautiful gorgeous lashes
8:39these are my new bouncing called Bella and they're my new obsession
8:43they are so full so fluffy so amazing is so we've just modern renaissance to our
8:57eyes it's time to modern renaissance are cheekbones
9:01the first thing i'm going to do is contoured this is already on my face
9:04because I didn't realize I wasn't filming yet i'm using break up by makeup
9:08geek on a more feet and 5 30 brush and I'm just going to mimic what I was doing
9:14ok so what I did was I just swooped break up right here in the hollows of my
9:19cheek data that cut and then with my zoeva 140 brush
9:24I picked up a little bit more of break up a contour powder by makeup geek and I
9:29focus on the base right here and then if you do that if you focus on that base
9:34there and then go in with a face powder and clean up underneath at the edges and

2:18super super light so I kind of mix these two together to get a really nice
2:23highlighted under I and for this amusing a more feet be 49
2:27I don't think people know how hard it is for Pihl people to have a highlighter on
2:31your eye area
2:33so this pallid having that white color that looks beautiful on the skin gives
2:38us pill pasties out there the opportunity to look highlighted as
2:43always the first thing we'll be doing is applying a base and this is my mac soft
2:47ochre Paint Pot i'm using a sigma 3d HD precision brush to apply this

3:58you don't want to have this huge amount of violence packed on and then you won't
4:04be able to blend anymore know you want to build it up

4:39alright going back to the 50 50 s pellet and taking this gorgeous peachy shimmery
4:44color gotta see color right here and using a mac 242 just applying this all
4:50over the lid
5:01to blow up the inner corners are going to take this a lot pigment in number 75
5:06and with a damp
5:07Luxy 217 brush i'm just going to blow up the inner corners
5:16for the lower lash line going to take this color right here from the morphe
5:1935o all matte palette and with a Cosette d 2 30 brush of first kind of lay down
5:25at base and then once you reach the center i'm gonna go in with an angled
5:32brush and create a new inner corner and then in that space in between
5:39i'm going to apply that same in wat pigment
5:43all right i want to do not to finish is apply some lashes and these are my
5:48glossy makeup and these are called Chelsea
5:58yeah
6:00now on this hot summer day we met was a part of sweat but we still want to
6:04exaggerate that we want to look sculpted and and like ready to to you know it's
6:09just I just went to school so i'm going to go in with the capital quantum medium
6:13sculpting powder and my favorite contouring brush the morphe m530 and a
6:19contour with that they're not a contour lover
6:23by all means skip this keep it fresh
6:27but Mama's gotta sculpt and then hopping over to my 140 brush by the way that and
6:35it's tiny bit of that contouring powder as well and really like really
6:42exaggerating the hollowness hollowness and then with your face powder
6:50underneath you can clean it up and make it look even more
6:57i'm also going to do a little bit of bronzing i'm going to go in with the
7:01cover effects bronzer in sun kissed and my Cosette number one brush I'm going to
7:07just this lightly around the hairline lightly also a little bit over that
7:14contour almost kind of as the blush a little bit on the chin
7:25and on the nose for watching going to use this mac blush in what I fancy and
7:32my new favorite blush brush
7:33I know the Co said number to brush is amazing for blush but I feel like it
7:39almost kind of lift the foundation and powder and kind of leaves holes in your
7:44base and this brush just one more feet this is the M 509 brush this just glides
7:51blush on like a dream
7:52so this is happening this brush is just so feather soft it just glides the blush
8:00on without disturbing the base
8:03I love it
8:07all right time to glow and I wanted this look to be all about the globe's so we
8:12have really flirty eyes beautiful skin but i want a glow
8:17I want this glow to be like when you're on the beach and you're wearing this
8:21glow
8:22I want people to think that your glow as the Sun your glow is stronger than the
8:27Sun and in order to do that I have a trick
8:30we're gonna spray are faced with a setting spray and by the time it's
8:35almost dry but it's still a little bit damn that's what you want to apply your
8:39highlighter it's the same as with eyeshadow when you use a damp brush it
8:44will go on so much more intense singles for highlighter so if you use
8:48so we're going to spray your face and then wait for it to be almost dry
8:52the perfect amount of dampness and then we apply highlighter and it's really
8:56going to count and for this we use the moonstone by becca and the setting spray
9:00i'll be using is by urban decay and this is the all nighter and give it a shake
9:04so we're going to do one half one half
9:10all right almost dry BAM
9:15can we take a seat
9:18can we take a seat
9:26not only will that make your glow last longer it will do this which is amazing
9:34almost mother of holy highlighters
9:43I'm sorry if you're watching this video with your parents in the room they'll
9:46probably think you're watching porn uh ok tip of the nose
9:50that's not forget and we don't need a damn place for this because the
9:56highlight on the nose is strong enough as it is
9:59and of course Cupid's bow alright ten-four lips
10:04all right now for this look I feel like you can go with ever you want for lips
10:08you can go bright dark nude matte glossy whatever is in between
10:14you can do whatever you want now I personally feel like this look is so
10:17much about the skin and about this flirty eyes
10:21I want to apply nude glossy lips just to keep it very sexual and summerish and
10:27just that
10:30so I'm a lightly going to outline my lips using the colour-pop lippie pencil
10:35in BFF
10:41yeah
10:41and then with the tiny brush i'm actually going to diffuse the center of
10:45the lip liner see what a lovely like about that gives by diffusing the center
10:54here but diffusing it just a little bit of it really gives you that j.lo like
10:58without that's a half over
11:02ok for loops are first going in with mel cosmetics sext just to kind of fill
11:09everything in over that lip liner
11:21all right and you a little bit more warmth in this lip so I'm going to go in
11:26with kind of sexy by Mac just happened over top

0:05lemonade and i'm not really doing a look inspired by Beyonce and more so doing
0:10they look to inspire you to wear to the formation tour
0:14so let's say you were one of the lucky few to actually get tickets to go see
0:18beyoncé

0:31me beyonce is a glam and beautiful and pretty so yeah if you want to have to
0:36get this Beyonce lemonade inspired makeup tutorial then please keep
0:40watching
0:41alright so the first thing we're going to do today is hydrate and for this is
0:45going to use today the Mario Badescu skin care facial spray and this contains
0:50a lot of rose water and lately I've been on a rosewater kick
0:53so i've been using this to kind of lock in moisture and hydrates i'm going to do
0:58that before we get in with the foundation smells amazing so just let
1:04your skin Stoke this up and then we are ready for foundation today for
1:08foundation i'll be using the new clinique beyond perfecting foundation
1:11and I'd be really really loving this one lately i'm in the color . 5 breeze and i
1:16were really loving this one because this one provides full coverage which you
1:20know i'm all about but yet it feels like nothing and it looks like a natural
1:24matte finish which is what I wish for in the foundation and I also make it is
1:29because it comes with a doe foot applicator which I like because you can
1:34evenly distribute the product all over the anyways let's get your plan
1:37so I'm just going to distribute some unto my face and buy some money
1:43enough for me
1:50I'm gonna blending using my Beauty Blender and you definitely want to tap
1:54the foundation in to get the most coverage but just look how much it
2:00covers any redness and flaws but still looks like natural skin
2:10another reason why i really like this one is because it stays on like a dream
2:17I wear this to an event in Dubai and it lasted for the entire day and didn't
2:21have to touch up
2:23it just looked perfectly flawless all day long and just people can we shut up
2:30to clinic for actually having a color light enough for my pasty Whiteface
2:34not a lot of brands have that option and the point five breeze color is amazing
2:39it's an exact match
2:41all right i'm loving this finish it's time for concealer for concealer today
2:45I'm gonna make a mixture with my bye-bye on your eye by a cosmetics and light and
2:50this new product for me this is by sephora and it's called the smoothing
2:54and brightening concealer and this is in the color Clara light one so popping bye
3:00bye under eye on earth
3:05right we're gonna ask them for some extra money and again going back in with
3:11my Beauty Blender and one solid
3:17and now i'm going to set it use mine arse powder in the snow
3:23all right now with my morphe m 4 44 and is a loter double wear powder and just
3:32going to set the remaining remaining parts of my face and they usually for my
3:41forehead and like using IE before consists a little larger and makes it
3:47quicker and for my under eyes are going to take the morphe 49 and mix double
3:52wear powder within our snow and apply that under my eyes to blend in the bank
4:01the first thing we're going to do four eyes is a pie base to keep this look on
4:04all day throughout that entire concert and I'm gonna go for max after great
4:09pain pot and to apply them using is Sigma 3 HD precision brush from the
4:17morphe 35o all mac palin going to take the lightest lightest shade and with a
4:22mac - 50 - I'm just going to set everything from my brow bone to crease
4:27with that color to help lending later on
4:30for the crystal be taking this color right here and mixing it with this one
4:39and with my morphe and 5 11 i'm just going to apply that to the crease
4:43softly now hopping over to the morphe 35o all shimmer palette and taking the
4:56lightest shade all the way in the top left and with my luck c 211 brush i'm
5:01just going to highlight my brow bone which i never do because I always keep
5:06my bride will Matt but for today i went for shimmer now going with this color
5:10right here for the lid and using a mac 242 to apply this
5:18and going over top a little with that whiter shade and also really
5:26highlighting the inner corners
5:29alright hopping back to the 3500 map palette and taking a warmer darker brown
5:36and with my morphe m5 14 just going to darken that Chris a tiny bit more
5:44all right now stand for the liner i'm going with my ardency Inn punker rock on
5:51liquid liner to create my outline and from the tip bring it back to the lash
5:58line and then connect the inner corner to the rest of the wing now going to
6:05feel everything in using line a sleigh is Sigma into color legend
6:10ok now we're going to create a new inner corner so extended with that same liquid
6:23liner
6:26and then I like taking my Oprah fix on eyeliner gel in black to really get that
6:33inner corner there
6:38all right now let's focus on the yellow and then go in with my yellow submarine
6:45six light eyeliners on my old friend I'm going to place it right underneath that
6:49you in a corner and then drag it out and that will be the yellow
6:53so with a Smith - 12:00 brush first laying down that eyeliner gel and then
7:03quickly right after said it with a yellow and I'm gonna go in with color
7:09pop scream gel liner in punch on my waterline and don't be afraid to drag
7:13this on to the actual lash line as well and also setting this with the yellow
7:21eyeshadow and i'm using well cosmetics neon and also dragging it out
7:30now with the black liner we're going to trace underneath the yellow to create an
7:35all-new I shape
7:41leaving the tiny room in between and only go in about this far
7:50yeah
7:52and then for the outer corner kind of pull it out straight and then going in
8:00with a warm brown and smudging this out slightly
8:05all right we finally reached our end destination as far as the I department
8:10goes it's not time for lashes
8:12I'm going to go in with the velocity lashes in Abu Dhabi and these are so
8:18amazing
8:19and yet so I'm gonna probably freak out
8:24all right we've come this far don't give up now it's time to conquer the face
8:31I got a contract today as always using the cabinet quantum medium sculpting
8:35powder and my favorite contouring brush the more feet and 5 30 time to match
8:42those sheeps give it to the haters
8:50we're also going to contour the Jolan because mama de fries yesterday and we
8:57gotta act like we didn't eat fries yesterday and a little trick I've been
9:01doing to make my contour even sharper but still natural and concentrate at the
9:06same time I've been taking my is so Ava 140 lux petite buffer brush and just a
9:13tiny bit of that conference powder and just at the very base of the contour
9:19intensified with that brush you can see how that's like a sunken and now
9:26lightly get it in get it out to blend and see how it made my contour more
9:35intense but not like oh my god
9:39contour where you going with that girl it's it's a girl where you go with a
9:43beautiful contour you know what to say and you can always go back in with your
9:46m44 for brush my morphe that still has your face powder in it and clean up
9:52underneath and can attempt at the edges to stuff it in and look for Less going
9:58to use a sigma or a powder this is in the color coeur de rose that and it's a
10:04very warm salty goodness for the cheeks
10:08so I'm going to use my cuz that number to brush to apply it and chest at some
10:12life to this cheeks
10:15and then a little trick I've been doing lately is grabbing the blush and also
10:22playing it softly on to the chin and I feel like that just adds a little bit
10:30more warmth to the face
10:33whereas if you don't do it it's just like no cheeks no so much life in the
10:37rest of the place is kind of dead like having a step for highlighter and then
10:43we use moonstone by becca and my favorite morphy highlighting brush my
10:47morphe m310 Becky with the good hair wears this is a highlighter and a little
10:58bit on the tip of the nose to show beyoncé when you're in the back of the
11:02audience that you're there
11:04she will see you a little bit on the Cupid's bow and if you really want to go
11:10from it below
11:11grab the time bid right here just in the center of your brows a little bit of
11:18love it
11:18just that sometimes just a tiny and the will make you look goal only for lips

11:26ombre I'm gonna go in with the new two-faced melted matte liquid lipsticks

11:36queen bee of course and this is going mainly on the outer corners
11:45yeah

12:05like this the perfect ombre new clip now all we need is some setting spray and

0:28first movie for me that she was everything I wanted her to live
0:32alert so Queen Ravenna charlize theron is back for the second movie which will
0:38hit theaters April Stevens here in the netherlands I'm so excited I saw the
0:42first trailers and I went up and this movie is all about Emily Blunt joining
0:48the cast because she is going to place your least Thrones sister and basically
0:52Emily Blunt is going to bring charlize theron back to life and then the sisters
0:57or at least they wanted that until jessica chastain and chris hemsworth

1:06below where you can see it but yeah go check it out i'm so inspired by this
1:10move a lot with so much and who knows maybe you can wear this look when you go
1:13see this movie
1:14although it's 3d so you'll be wearing glasses and nobody will be there to
1:19appreciate your beauty plus it's dark but hey hey hey it's the thought that
1:24matters
1:25yeah without any further ado if you would like to know how to get this Queen
1:28Ravenna
1:29charlize theron the Huntsman winters war inspired makeup look then please keep
1:35watching
1:36alright guys the first thing we're going to do is moisturize because we want our
1:39skin to look young and radiant I'm gonna go in with my cetaphil moisturizing
1:43cream first
1:46and following through used to make pixi by petra hydrating milky missed give it
1:51a nice little shake and spray
1:54well for foundation today I'm going to go in with the Loreal infallible Pro
1:59matte 24 hour foundation and i'm in the color 101 classic ivory
2:04I'm going to be working it in using my Beauty Blender
2:07for concealer abusing the it cosmetics bye bye under eye and light
2:29yeah
2:30and again blend in using my Beauty Blender
2:35and sometimes after all that blending it can dry up a little bit more so I like
2:40to go back in with that milky more shrines and missed and kind of rhe
2:44dampen it
2:50yeah
2:54and now setting it using mine are soft felt that loose powder and snow like
2:58Snow White and since you don't want this foundation to go anywhere throughout the
3:02day
3:03it's a good idea to now set it with powder and my favorite brush for that is
3:07the morphe m44 for this just packs in that powder like a dream
3:13and for my under-eye cereal like using this makeup geek angled stippling brush
3:17so a combination of these two for powder is amazing and the power I used for like
3:23all three of my face is my mac studio fix in NW 15 and as we get closer
3:28underneath my eyes i mix this with the nurse powder
3:37studded baby right here on the cheeks
3:40I don't mix it with the nurse powder yet but as soon as I hit that like on your
3:44eye area
3:46I know that I should be mixing so I mix the powder on the brush underneath set
3:53and wipe away the baby and for like this spot right here like to take a smaller
3:59brush
4:00this is by sephora and it's the pro press full coverage precision kind of
4:06going on and pack the partner in there because one of my biggest makeup papu's
4:10is when like that side of the nose is all shiny in and I like them sides of
4:16the notes to be Matt as always super thing going in with is of course my mac
4:21software her pain part to keep this look on all day long
4:24people always ask me why I never changed this one up
4:27now it's like it's like oh would you put your child up for adoption when you've
4:33had your child for like five years
4:35no yeah you love it and you won't leave it you know some products are just meant
4:40to stick with you forever
4:42going in with the amazing to face sweet peach palette and going in with the
4:47color white peach within back to 52 i'm just going to start highlighting my brow
4:51and then dragging it down
4:55so really apply this from brow bone to crease and this will make blending later
5:01on extremely easier for the crease of mixing this color right here with
5:06charmed I'm sure
5:08and doing that softly using a mac 224 brush you want to go all the way to
5:16words the inner cruise with this color because it's going to be dramatic and
5:22evil and smoky
5:24so we really want to make an impact here by going all the way to that inner
5:29corner here and also focus on really wanting it onto the outer corner here
5:34and smoking it up and out
5:38I guess that you want this to be super dramatic so don't be afraid
5:45go out make that way and I keep telling you guys
5:49the further you go up the less pressure you want to put on that brush the softer
5:55you apply that shadow once you go higher up the nicer the blend you can you can
6:01like really stamp it in here at the base of the crease with the higher you go up
6:06soft pressure for a really nice applying lino like going back in with that - 52
6:12and white peach and really clean up underneath tape is unnecessary
6:18all you need is in highlight color and brush and clean it up and also let's say
6:24you feel like oh my god just tested some of the eyeshadow and I tasted it it's
6:28just like page
6:29it's amazing you feel like you're blending it a little bit off key you can
6:32always go back in with the brush and kind of soften right at the edge just
6:39really softly
6:41making it a little bit soft and your blended with charmed I'm sure mi is the
6:47wave a 234 I'm darkening my inner and outer thirds for the living to go ahead
6:56and take over the case
6:58gold mine eye shadow which is gorgeous and with a damp mac 242 brush just
7:03applied to the center of the lid and blend out now going in with tempting and
7:12darkening that inner and outer corner even more
7:24for the lower lash line now applying the color pop cream gel liner in were and
7:29really applied from inner to outer corner and now with the pencil brush and
7:34charmed I'm sure only going to buff that lower lash line out there really
7:38darkening it using tempting
7:43and i also really darkening those inner corners to have a base for the gold
7:49later on
7:52and you guessed it with means the wave a 240 and gold mine
7:56I'm going to blast those inner corners with gold not to finish off all you want

0:00hey guys so a couple of days ago I ordered some new Anasazi portfolios
0:03eyeshadows off of sephora and they came in yesterday and they truly inspired me
0:09to come up with this makeup look right here
0:11it's a very warm tone sexy smoky eye with the glitter pink and silver glitter
0:17and then I wanted to do something different for the lips so not go with
0:21like a typical new door like a dark or like a red so I went from like a
0:26cool-toned pinky nude which totally contrast with the eyes and I i am
0:32totally living for it I went for my cool girl hair
0:35so yeah if you would like to know how to get this makeup look right here
0:39then keep on watching alright guys so the first thing you want to do is
0:42moisturize your skin so you have a nice base to work with and my skin is still a
0:47little bit dry from all the drama that happened last week
0:50so prior to filming I again went in with this labo superfood he's calm cleansing
0:55oil it's a two-way product it can be used to take your makeup off with adds a
0:59like break up oil but it's also great as a serum which is what i use it for
1:04and again I went in with my most hardcore moisturizer I know of beauty
1:08sleep cream by olavo as well
1:10I do however want to minimize the appearance of my pores a little bit so
1:14I'm going to go in with the pores no more pore refiner primer by dr. brand
1:19and i love this line by dr. brand so i bought it and i'm going to try it out
1:24today and i'm only going to spread this out on my nose and my chin area because
1:29in those areas my ports are the largest comes with a little bit of a tent was
1:35very involved
1:36oh holy baby jesus that really I don't know how but that like filled up all my
1:42pores but still has it looking hydrated instead of like normally when you use
1:48creams like this
1:49it gets rid of the pores but it always ends up looking so dry and like
1:53dehydrated but this looks just like your ports have disappeared my god

0:54and this is also the reason why on wednesday i didn't have video going up
0:58on monday i got a facial peel and it was with all natural fruit acids and the
1:04girl who did it on me told me you know what you'll be fine your skin will be
1:08renewed and reborn for tonight's video that you're going to film today
1:11basically my skin got all red and then after that it started to peel and get
1:15really dry and patchy - I tried to record this video yesterday and I feel
1:21up to two times and it looks like crap because my under eye area was so dry and
1:26it just looked so wrong but after a day full of masks and moisturizers i'm back
1:32and ready to film this one so i went in with the hola bow super foodies com
1:37cleansing face oil and this is a great product because one it's a cleanser
1:44it's a cleansing oil to get your makeup off with but - if you use the tiny teeny
1:49bit it's great as a serum that degree find it that you have two purposes for
1:53one product and then after i went in with the only moisturizer I know that is
1:57like hardcore and will moisturize a desert and that is the alabi beauty
2:03sleep cream and this is the most hardcore moisturizer I know of
2:07so I packed those
2:08you on this morning and I'm almost surprised and ready to go
2:12today I first want to do some color correction so I'm gonna go in with the
2:15new
2:16Becca backlight targeted color correctors and i'm going to use the
2:20color green for my redness peach for any shadows and going to use the color
2:24violet to perk up my skin so just with a flat foundation brush I pick some of the
2:29product up and just painted my face
2:37yeah
2:43can see how much had already reduced any redness on my faiths so much more
2:49peaceful as you can see the more i applied the violet sort of as a flower
2:58from within the more healthy and just radiant a certain look and last but not
3:06least a little bit of the peach
3:07on my chin area
3:15now with the slightest like the slightest bit of powder you gently want
3:19to press is all over the face to set the color correction and go over top with
3:23the foundation if you do not do this
3:26basically what you're doing is all this color correction work
3:29once you go over with your foundation it will just start dragging the color
3:32correction and you've done everything for nothing
3:35so you kind of want to sit and lock all this correction with the tiniest bit of
3:40powder for foundation today I'm going to go in with my favorite my makeup forever

5:29blending it in there and then with the lid car we can really clean it up and
5:34cut it now with the Cosette d 2 20 and as somewhat lighter color from that same
5:43palette i'm going to buff it out
5:51and now with this color right here i'm really going to intensify the base of
5:55the cut crease and doing so with my Cosette p 365 rush

6:10softly blend all the edges and give them a nice fade and kind of corrected with
6:15all of this for my lids i'll be going in with this dose of colors ideal duo in
6:21frozen and the top comes with a creamy product so i'll be playing that as a
6:26base and on the bottom it comes with a beautiful pigment and i'll be applying

2:35yeah
2:42and now going to bake using the NARS soft velvet loose powder in snow in
2:56order to make this look last as long as possible i'm gonna prime using my Mac
3:01soft ochre Paint Pot and applying it using my Sigma 3d HD precision brush
3:07now i'm going to set my Christian brow bone area using a lighter not shade and
3:14this will really help blending later on with makeup geek americano eyeshadow
3:19i'll be cutting my crease and for this it's best to look straight ahead in a
3:23mirror and just place your crease a tiny tad bit above your natural crease like I
3:28did here
3:29it's just right above it and then just follow through by following the natural
3:33curve of your eye and then it's just a little bit more dramatic and the person
3:38using for this is a makeup studio number 22 brush
3:50now mixing americana with Barcelona beach also make up because medics and
3:55with my Cosette p 365 brush i'm just going to start blending that crease that
4:00a little bit more
4:09you want to remember to never go below this line to start to speak this is your
4:15new crease and we're not going to put anything below your new crease because
4:19everything below your new crease is for that beautiful gold now with my Cosette
4:24d 2 20 and Barcelona beach only I start blending even more
4:34yeah
4:39and then with my zoeva - 20 brush and that same color we apply them the crease
4:43and brow bone you can kind of use it as an eraser for the goal i'm going to go
4:47in with this amazing metal pigment by danessa Marik's and it's in the color
4:52Pharaoh and as my mixing medium today to really make it stick
4:55i'll be using the Bionic gel activator by Bionic beauty
5:00so first I apply a layer of bed gel that's a base and remember with this you
5:06can also really clean up the line underneath the cut crease because
5:10someone that pigment up and Pat it on top
5:25now with my morphe e43 brush and the americano only are really going to
5:30concentrate on the base of that new crease for the waterline i'm going to go
5:36in with these two wava graphic eyes in black to earth and with my tweezer men
5:46line glider brush and americano only I'm just gonna bust that in
5:57for the winged liner I'll first be making my outline using the Kat Von D
6:01tattoo liner in trooper now using Sigma's aligning at the legend to
6:10continue the wing
6:14now it's time for some crazy amazing lashes
6:20these are by elevation lashes and these are called ascension number five
6:25after the lower lashes i decided to go a little bit more on the softer side so i
6:30went for the house of lashes precious lashes
6:44ok now that we finish up on these beautiful golden eyes intend to cut
6:48those cheeks and get our contouring on today I'll be contouring used to make
6:52Kevin a quan medium sculpting powder and my morphe and 5 30 brush and remember
6:57this is a draft tutorial but if you want to wear this as a woman
7:03please make the contour as intense and stark as you want and I'm thinking going
7:07to go a little bit more extreme today
7:14yeah
7:17yeah
7:19but i'm also going to do a tiny bit of nose contouring and by tiny I mean a lot
7:31now as you can see this is way too intense so a trick is to grab a bigger
7:35brush and your face powder and just glided over top to stop and the
7:42harshness of it and this will also blended down
7:46it's still has a defining moment now but it's less harsh
7:50this is a trick I picked up from the same and it's amazing
7:53and that's to make it even more intense what you can do is pick your
7:56Beautyblender up with some powder and on top of the edge of the contour line you
8:03created you want to bake and this will make it even more intense but it will
8:11also clean up any shadows you don't want to brush away again and that way you
8:16have a nose contoured that remains very soft but still very effective
8:21I'm going to warm up my face using my to faith milk chocolate bronzer and light
8:25medium and my Cosette number one brush for black going to go in with Max
8:33Spellbinder and my Cosette number to brush for that ultimate glow I'm first

0:05rihanna work inspired makeup tutorial
0:08it was hard to kind of pin down what she was wearing because she was either in
0:12the shade or humping someone's leg so I decided instead of going like literal
0:18recreation to give it a little bit more of a dramatic spin i made my eyeliner a
0:23little bit more seductive and mysterious and intense
0:26so besides from the eyeliner i think this is pretty close to what Rihanna was
0:30wearing green lips cream lips people
0:34I had so much fun doing this look for you and if you want to know how to get
0:37it then please keep watching
0:39all right the first thing we're going to do is go in with the kills ultra facial
0:43moisturizer because my skin is still feels very dry
0:46so we need all the moisture we can get for foundation today I'm going to try
0:53something new

0:58foundation and concealer

0:05Bowl when she sang the national anthem when that camera flew by and I saw a
0:12spark of red which was her suit
0:15I already felt like that was the greatest moment of my life when I saw
0:19that spark of red
0:20I went yes Queen lady gaga killed it
0:24lady gaga was so amazing i was so proud of her and when she blinked and we all
0:29saw that beautiful glittery red lid my Twitter bombarded with tweets asking for
0:35requests and I just died
0:37i drooled a little and today I'm here to do the look for ya
0:41surprisingly enough i think this look is perfect for valentine's day or for like
0:44clubbing on Valentine's Day
0:46it's just a really cool glittery look anyways without any further ado if you
0:51would like to know how to get this lady gaga makeup look right here
0:54then keep watching alright so the first thing you want to do is prime and today
0:59I'm going from my becca backlight priming filter because i want to glow
1:03like a super bowl
1:05national anthem star for my nose and chin i need a little bit more of a prime
1:13for that i'm using the Bekaa ever Mac parlous priming perfect
1:26firm foundation today I'm going to go for a ride or die and make up for ever
1:29ultra foundation sticks because they're my favorite so I'm lasting 120 on the
1:35outer perimeter of my face and 117 on the inner
1:56and with my trusty Beauty Blender I'm going to blend it all in
2:10for concealer I'm going for the cabinet quan central skin enhancer in sx a one
2:16and lightning it a little bit using my krylon TV pin stick in
2:2100
2:28and again blaming that in using my Beauty Blender and i'm going to bake
2:41using mine are soft velvet loose powder in snow
2:56i'm priming my eyelids using Mac soft ochre Paint Pot
3:04work max of vanilla eyeshadow i'm just setting my crease of Robin area to get a
3:10completely met and easier to blend later on we need a little bit of transition in
3:16that crease so first i'm going in with makeup cosmetics peach smoothie and
3:21softly blending this into the crease using a mac 224 brush
3:38now for some depth of hiding Showtime also by making because medals to the lid
3:42and the crease and I'm first using this naked studio number 17 brush to lay the
3:48color down
4:00and with a Cosette d 2 20 brush I'm just softly blending it into the crease
4:20and with these a waiver to 40 brush i'm also applying it to the lower lash I
4:24know about halfway in for the inner corner i'm highlighting with a mixture
4:34of max think pink and nylon eyeshadow and applying this using the light
4:40portion of my cavity shade + light eye brush
4:46ok now comes the fun part but also the hardest part
4:50the glitter and what I did was just go a little bit above my natural crease and I
4:55did give it a little bit of a shape at the outer corner just to lift the I a
4:59little bit more a trick is when you're not doing this on camera
5:02lean forward with your face while looking down and then pack that glitter
5:07on and that way you will have the least amount of fallout as an adhesive today
5:11i'll be using the lit clearly liquid glitter base and the Glitter i'll be
5:15using it's also by lit and this is firecracker number for the first laying
5:20that bass down and going right over top with the glitter
5:36and if you feel like the glitter is not fully opaque there's this amazing
5:44pigment by illamasqua called berber and i'll use that to fill up any holes can
5:54always use a fan to dry the glitter a little bit quicker so you will not get
5:59any creases in it
6:00now all you want to do is finish off with some lashes and i'm using the hood
6:05of beauty Maryland the goggles cheeks looked very sculpted and glowy and
6:17supernatural flushed so wrong so I'm going to contract today using my cabinet
6:24one sculpting cutter in medium and my morphe and 5 30 brush going to do a
6:38little quick with of baking

7:02my favorite also highlighting the tip of my nose & mckellips ball
7:15Oh cute
7:20and for watched a little bit of mac speeches and cause that number to brush
7:27and spring a little bit of makeup forever missed em fix to set this entire
7:41shebang
7:42all right for lips going to go for something nude and flattering because
7:51there's so much going on in here in this portion of the face
7:55so you want to keep this portion of the face a little bit more wearable
7:59I hate that word no kidding that suffers are going in with a mac lipstick called
8:04kinda sexy and I'm aiming to words more of the outer parts of my lips and going

0:15applied the lashes out of nowhere
0:17glitter came around the corner you know glitter is always near when I'm around

0:26line
0:26I kind of started living for that by the time I had to do my kebab am bright lip
0:31I was like no I'm not in the mood to do a command right now live right now so

0:40angelic glitter lashes she knew d look see the previous two episodes of winter

1:17instead of always going for my nivea men after shave long today I'm going to mix
1:21things up a little bit and show you different options
1:24so the first product and going in with is by marc jacobs and this is the
1:28invisible undercover perfecting coconut primer and what I personally love about
1:37this primer is that it feels a little bit more thick and you really feel it
1:41hydrating your skin and therefore it makes it perfect for drier skin and just
1:46really gives it that lecture skill to apply makeup to to minimize the
1:51appearance of my pores and then go in with this tart clean slate primer
1:55I'm going to tap this into my skin because after watching the purposes of
2:00all morning and she loves this stuff and she told me to pat
2:06this in instead of smearing it
2:09I'm follow you boo since my skin is going to be such a huge feature of this
2:13look I wanted to be flawless
2:15so I love changing things up just not the sticks so i'm going to go back into
2:19my makeup forever alter HD foundation sticks
2:22I love them ride or die and that is what i'll be using to achieve a flawless face
2:28so again folks outer perimeter 120 inner 117
2:43london using your beauty blender
3:00for concealer i'll use another writer die it cosmetics bye bye under eye in
3:05light and like I said skin will be such a big feature of this look so go ahead
3:09and highlight with that concealer and really get it to an A plus plus
3:21yeah
3:27yeah
3:29so really now also using it as a highlighter and again you know it
3:37so I want to do everything first and then my eyes
3:41last I don't know why but it works for me
3:49yeah
3:56yeah
3:59so from the lowest point of where you apply the concealer work your way up
4:05towards your eye and I really buff it in
4:13now what is that you're under is using powder to prevent it from creasing we
4:17call it
4:18baking
4:28and then I also like to bake the sides of my nose because I get shiny there and
4:36like 1.2 seconds so mama needs the bank
4:40get all of it and now would be the time to do your brows and that's exactly what
4:46I'm going to do right now off camera
4:48ok so that I look is super minimal but we still wanted to look flawless
4:52so first I'm gonna prime using with software group in part by mac and for
4:55this amusing a sigma 3d HD precision brush now i'll be taking the lightest
5:02shade from the urban decay naked smoky palette and that is called 13 and what
5:07days away about 220 brush

6:30roots of my lashes and for lashes i'll be using these true beauties right here
6:42these are ahead of beauty and they are called Raquel
6:52and then really lift him using your fingers by pushing up the base of the
6:57lash and then the front and a push straight board so it doesn't go up as
7:01much because i like these clashes better when the front is more straight out
7:06words and the outer corners more up to get there really nice with my Urban
7:11Decay heavy metal glitter liner in glam rock
7:14I just had a couple of letters to my lower lash line

0:31yeah i just hope you enjoy and without any further ado let's go on to the
0:35tutorial so it's Christmas and you want your makeup to last all day long and so
0:42the first thing I'm going to do is prime
0:44I got a prime using nivea men after shave balm insensitive
0:48ok I haven't said this in a long time so here we go this contains glycerin at the
0:53second most used ingredients and glycerin makes products stick to it
0:58so when you use this as a base the makeup will really stick on to it making
1:03it last all day long I've been a fan of this for forever now and I've got so
1:07many people to use this
1:09and trust me this works and the goals that you only take a little bit and
1:14start buffing it into the skin and you want to keep puffing until it starts
1:19feeling Jackie
1:20so you'll feel it be really liquidy when you first apply it but then once you
1:24start smoothing and in for like a minute it becomes tacky
1:28that is what you want so for me right now is really tacky and that is perfect
1:34also can we say hi to the space troll I have right here
1:37why I want that flawless finish is so for foundation today I'm going to go for
1:42my favorite makeup forever foundation ultra HD sticks
1:46i apply 122 the outer perimeter of my face and 117 to the inner
1:5417
2:07and then with the Beauty Blender i'm going to start bouncing this in
2:19then for concealer it cosmetics bye bye under eye in light my favorite
2:28and again london using your beauty blender
2:39and then setting everything with powder to prevent it from creasing the first
2:45thing i'll be applying to my eyes is my mac suffer great pain pop to prevent my
2:48eyes from creasing and i'm applying this using a sigma 3d HD precision brush now
2:56to help blending i'm going to set my crease the brow bone area using a match
3:00new Chado going into these you a ready-to-wear were solid I'm taking the
3:06color
3:06sahara and with an honest hacer Beverly Hills blending brush i'm applying that
3:10to the crease all you want to do with this is just give your eyes some
3:18definition because later on once the wing is on we're going to go back in
3:23with a darker color and really intensify that i'm just giving myself a guideline
3:28here now I'm applying makeup geeks peach smoothie
3:31and with that same Anasazi Beverly Hills brush go ahead and buff out that crease
3:36and this was especially help get that beautiful flawless blend and a little
3:42bit of warm for my little first applying a tiny bit of this color pop gel liner
3:47and this is in the color exit and we're going to use this as a base to really
3:51make that live
3:51pop
3:57and immediately right after go in with a match cream color and said it
4:05i'm also applying that mac cream color to my inner corners to open them up now
4:12for the fun part the lower lash line first we're going to start off with
4:16eyeliner applying a point to be very intercourse here to extend the eye and
4:21from there we can create a liner and from there we can create a whole new I
4:25shape and from the tip of the winged dragon back onto the lash line now
4:37connect the extended inner corner to the wing and you've got yourself an outline
4:42now of course you have to feel this all in
4:46and for this I'm using my Sigma legend line ace
4:49now with that seems you a color i applied to the crease you want to create
4:53a line parallel to the eyeliner we just created and dislocate a new inner corner
4:59i'm going to give them more depth and strength using a medium brown matte
5:05eyeshadow
5:06so now it's time to really open up that I using a white liquid liner for this
5:11i'll be using my Sigma 1 this is the line 8 in endorse and to open up my eyes
5:21even more i'm applying a white liner to my waterline
5:24this is the same one by color pop it's the same color exit but it's in a pencil
5:29form
5:32now to really ground that new lower lash line and using makeup geeks americano
5:37eyeshadow and just really start adding definition to that new lower lash line

0:12look it was inspired by selena gomez at the 2015 amas she slayed that look honey
0:20and the performance girl
0:23Selena was definitely my top favorite of the night she looked gorgeous i love the
0:28pop of copper and red so I was inspired by her makeup looked to create this look
0:33right here
0:34so yeah without any further ado if you would like to know how to get this
0:37selena gomez inspired makeup look
0:39then people watching as always the first thing i'll be doing is priming my
0:43eyelids and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this and i'm applying this
0:47using a sigma 3d HD precision brush them with a light cream colored eyeshadow i'm
0:54setting my crease and brow bone area and this will help me blend the shadows i
0:59put in the crease a lot easier for my crease I'll going with the Urban Decay
1:03blush in video and makeup geeks cherry cola shadow and with a more fee and 505
1:10I'm first blending this into my crease but mainly on the outer part and winging
1:14it out
1:26then with a zueva - 20 brush
1:29I just softly blend the edges now with cherry cola only and that same brush
1:36start building up definition going in with Max a little lusty blush and visit
1:44the exact red tone that Selena had on her outer crease and increase so i'm
1:48going to apply that to the outer and inner crease and i'm using a more fiji
1:5317 for this and this we can just make everything a little teensy bit more
1:58bright for the latter first going in with Captain D's metal crush eyeshadow
2:03in raw power and i'm applying this with a mac 239
2:11following through with this next prismatic eyeshadow in fireball
2:25every pop of peach i'm using this - I'll see every Hills illuminator in peach
2:30nectar and with these a wave at 234 that is going on the inner third of the lid
2:35for your lower lash line and going back in with fireball by nicks and then with
2:45that mac blush and a sigma e 15 i'm just adding more red to the lower lash line
2:51now i'm going to apply the Urban Decay 24-7 waterline pencil in legend to my
2:58waterline and now directly to the roots of the lashes apply some black shadow
3:06now it's time for the beautiful smoky liner so first going in with my captain
3:13d in kleiner in trooper to make my lines and then fill in using my signal line
3:18aids in legend
3:32yeah
3:42once you've got that line now you want to grab these the wave of 322 and smoke
3:47it out with black eyeshadow
3:52I want to do now is finish the look off with some lashes and these are hood of
3:56beauty
3:57Audrey and a little trick I always do to get the inner corners lifted is I come
4:07with a tweezer from above and kinda bend them straight up so I just go to that
4:15route and stick it straight up kind of lifted
4:25and they would also helps us just with your finger to push at them so they lift
4:32up
4:34I'm for cheeks Selena didn't really have much going on on the apples of her
4:39cheeks with mostly contour and warmed up with a blush and lots of glow so further
4:45that bronze up my face using this to face and was summer 16 hour long wear
4:50bronzer the blush i'll be using for this is a more fee and 527 just lightly
4:58contour and bronze up your face with this bronzer or any bronze you may have
5:05I love this bronzer so much
5:08it's not too orange is not too yellow
5:13not too dirty and then what I always like to do is take a big fluffy brush
5:16and just about everything and even more so it's traceless and blend it in and
5:23just look good there for a highlighter today I'm going to go in with
5:26unnecessarily hills the Starlight illuminator and i'm using a sigma hi
5:32cheekbone highlighter fo3 brush for this and then also highlight the tip of my
5:44nose the bridge of the nose and my Cupid's bow and therefore blushing and
5:54we use urban decay's blush in video again the same that went into the crease
5:58and I'm just taking a little bit because the Urban Decay blushes are super
6:02pigmented and a sigma s 37 brush which I really love for blush lately and from
6:09the contour kind of go up to the highlight and kind of diffuse everything
6:17together but don't really come forward to the apple of the cheek because solita
6:24definitely didn't have anything
6:26they're just keep it on the side like a slob bitch
6:30look at that hole now i'm going to do to finish this off is spray my face using
6:34the skin and Naevia make a finishing spray i love this one
6:39get rid of the powder look for lips are going to use this urban decay liner in
6:44naked Urban Decay Naked lip liner and this is the exact color I'm looking
6:55first i'm also going to fill in the entire lip with this
7:06and then only in the center a little bit of melted sugar by two phase

1:53I've been trying it for like a month now and it is so so flipping although and
1:58why I love this so much is because it doesn't have any silicone and the thing

3:19it just looks photoshopped to perfect it like there's a blur on your face so I
3:25like to just go on to my face

3:34hello to me and then with your Beautyblender start tapping this into
3:39the skin and give yourself that flaw lost face

5:02brown in the crease later on a lot more now going into the urban decay Gwen
5:07Stefani palette and I'm taking the color zone and with a morphy m505 i'm just
5:13applying that to the crease to build definition then also dragging it down to
5:22the outer V and also making that nice and smoky
5:29now i'm going to grab a little bit of Anaheim and with the morphe mb 23 I'm
5:34just blending that out of the transition color now going in the tart tart lapel

6:18be applying Urban Decay polyester bride
6:25for the lower lash i'm using a Mac - 28 to apply that same dark brown color from
6:32the tartlet pellet again all you want to do now is focused on the beautiful black

1:51nice and perfect now I'm going to bake my under eye area to prevent everything
1:55from creasing quickly to my brows a little back
1:58so then some loops first such a key feature of the look i thought why not
2:02start with lips today and then build onto the eyes
2:05if we're looking to use this fusion beauty lipstick in Moulin Rouge
2:09it's actually the fusion beauty lip fusion plump and shine lipstick in
2:13moulin rouge and I got recommended this by a friend and she told me it has

2:45highest here and then kind of moved down here to get that really nice hard shape
2:50than a heart-shaped give that really classic shape
3:02so instantly do you see how has that little curve right here
3:08that is what you want to follow that gives it that really classic vintage
3:11touch
3:15now fill in straight from the bullet
3:20so as I'm applying it straight from the bullet I definitely feel a slight very

4:01for the crease along in the Cielo eyes are the window shadow palette in mind
4:06and for that I'll be using this color right here plus the color at the top and
4:10I'm going to slightly cut the crease with this
4:13so with my makeup geek defined crease brush
4:16I'm looking straight forward and applying the shadow right above my
4:21crease so that when I look straight forward can still see it and then at the
4:26outer portion want to softly wing it out then from the outer corner
4:38bring that up to that wing and blend the two together and with a more fee and for
4:4633
4:47I'm slightly blending that out and slowly but surely start defining that
4:55cut crease soft cut crease more and more using the same colors for the living
5:03going to take this Natasha Nona eyeshadow in cream and this is going
5:07onto my lid and also softly cutting that crease even more
5:14using that color right up to the crease and sort of cut it even more and also
5:22putting this on the inner corners for the lower lash time again using that
5:28seal appellate and i'm using this color right here and this color right here and
5:32really closely to the lower lash line start bringing in that shadow and then
5:44to really grab the eyes and give it that vintage he feel you want to apply a
5:48small clique of eyeliner just on the outer corners and keep it really nice
5:52and cute

0:41tutorial and i started doing my make up today sort of following along with Perry
0:45had on her face and then once i was done i feel like all the attention was so

1:38minimizing color brightening homes like a jilted me
1:42and since most of you enjoyed the natural way of applying my foundation in

3:07little bit more natural so let's go on to setting this whole thing so in order
3:11to keep the face looking a little bit more natural you don't want to powder
3:14too much because that will become pancake e so too lightly part of my face

3:31so to keep it a little bit more natural and powdering my t-zone plus a pet peeve
3:37of mine is when airlines are greasy they want to partner right next to the nose
3:44and then also a little bit on the chin and on the sides of your mouth where you

0:14hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial on the black smokey look that demi
0:18lovato was wearing in her new music video
0:21cool for the summer which in my opinion is these summer anthem of 2015 the
0:27entire music video is so sexy and I was makeup is on . and i think she's never
0:32looked better
0:34so that is the look that I'm doing for you today if you would like to know how
0:36to get this
0:37demi lovato black smokey eyes makeup look and keep watching
0:41so the first thing i'll be doing of course is priming and today i will not
0:45be going in with my aftershave balm nivea I'm actually a little bit more dry
0:49today
0:50and when I'm a little bit more dry i like going for the set of Phil and this
0:54is the hydration low shown a subscriber here on my channel recommended this to
1:00me if you have dry skin this also has glycerin as it's the second ingredient
1:06and glycerin make stuff stick to it
1:08so if you use this as your base your makeup will really stick onto the
1:11cluster in making it stay on all day
1:13so instead of my aftershave balm i'm going to use this because I'm a little
1:17bit more try
1:18just as with the aftershave balm I do like to follow through with my smashbox
1:22primer water for foundation today I'm going to go in with my born this way
1:26foundation by to face and this is in the color ivory and of course I cannot go
1:31without my dearest cojiendo on confirmation in 213
1:35so i'll be making a mixture of these two right here and that will be my
1:39foundation and i'm applying this using my morphe e6 brush
1:55for my concealer and first going to correct so let me use my mac studio
2:01finish correct and conceal in pale pink and pale yellow
2:15and then going over top with my urban decay naked skin concealer in fair
2:21neutral and working that in with a real techniques bunch
2:38and setting that with powder to prevent everything from creasing so for the eyes
2:44the first thing you want to do is prime them
2:46of course because we're going to work with black eye shadows and that is one
2:50of the hardest looks to do and for this we're going to use my mac software paint
2:54pot and i'm applying it with a days away by 142 concealer buffer brush then to
3:01make the blending and decreased way easier and i'm going to take this Bobby
3:04Brown ivory eyeshadow and i'm setting the softer could paint pot from my
3:08crease up to my brow bone and this will just help blend all the eyeshadows that
3:13we put over top way easier as you may have noticed i still have some powder
3:18underneath my eyes and I'm doing this so that would ever dark color falls down as
3:23fallout
3:23I can brush away right after so this way you will not have any fallout at the end
3:28of the look for my crease that first going in with these two shades from the
3:32morphe 35o and palate and with a morphy m 4 12 I'm just blending that in and for
3:42a black smokey eye look it's extremely important to have a blending transition
3:47color in your crease because if you don't lending will become so harsh and
3:52so unattractive it will become so wrong
3:57so having that blending transition color in the crease will really make this look
4:01a lot more wearable and easy to do
4:04from that same palette of mixing these two colors right here and this is also
4:08going in the crease just to darken it up and with ajax beauty line number 7 brush
4:13I'm just buffing that in
4:19yeah
4:21and to really blend those edges just take that first brush you used with the
4:25first to blending shades and just wiggle back and forth between the lines and it
4:30will soften it and blend it out for Matt late i'm going to use the Tasha de known
4:35as blackest black matte eyeshadow and I'm going to pack this on using a mac
4:39242 and with a makeup geek defined crease brush
4:48I'm just blending the edges into the brown
4:55once you're done doing the top portion you can take away all this powder and
4:59remove the fall out for a bit lower lash line and again going in with that
5:03Natasha didn't own a black is black eyeshadow and I'm just smoking the black
5:07into the roots of my lower lashes then with my Mac - 13 in a soft brown color
5:18I'm just blending and smoking that out and then for some shine on the inner
5:22corners of taking this color pop
5:24liberty is super shadow
5:33to finish off going to apply some mascara and false ease and the policies
5:37of using today are by her beauty and these are the main clashes in Naomi p
5:50yeah
5:54ok for cheeks i think it's an understatement when I say Demi was glowy
5:59and bronzy like her makeup artist went all out on the cheeks
6:04so first I'm going to warm up my skin because I definitely need a lot of
6:07bronzer to mimic her bronze venus
6:10so I'm gonna mix - I'm going to use the tart park at princess bronzer right here
6:15and then to warm it up a little bit more
6:18my give me some more light skin finish my mac draw a line
6:29groans adult and of course around the hairline then to contour i'm going to
6:38use a bobby brown eyeshadow this is weeks and this is a New Found Love
6:43Actually this is great
6:45so with miles away but luxe highlight brush and just carving up my cheeks for
6:54blessing to use melodia Luminoso and for this amusing a is the wave looks cheek
6:59finished brush now you want to go all out with the highlighting we're gonna go
7:04cry so the highlighter i'll be using today is Mary Lou because this you can
7:08see this in space
7:09it's that Chinese so we need that so with great morphy and 501 brush my new
7:14favorite highlighting brush i am going to go and highlight my cheekbones first
7:19now with Demi you could clearly see that when she smiled
7:25it was also on the apple of her cheek so give yourself a little small and ding
7:29ding ding ding
7:31just a tiny bit we're also going to highlight the brow bone with this above
7:39the arch of your brow then also of course your Cupid's bow and then also
7:44those two lines going up to your nose

0:19hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial on this makeup look right here
0:24this is inspired by rihanna's new music video
0:27bitch better have my money i love this music video because rihanna is just
0:32patch it crazy in it and I i love that
0:34so I decided to recreate the look where she is about to cut murder the man she
0:43grabs his knife that looks at it all fiercely and then she's about to cut
0:47someone that is the look that I'm doing plus i'm also collaborating with shan XO
0:52Shannon here I knew too and she is recreating the library Anna is wearing
0:56the purple blue lips and the eyeliner that scene cuts by really fast but the
1:01look is gorgeous they definitely don't forget to check out Shannon's but i'll
1:04put the link down below and you can click here in the screen and it will
1:08take you to her video show her love
1:10no comment tell her i sent you and just share the law without any further ado if
1:15you would like to know how to get this Rhiana bitch better have my money make a
1:19book then keep watching
1:21alright so the first thing i'll be doing is priming my face so that my face stays
1:25intact all day long and for this I'm using my nivea men after shave balm
1:30insensitive
1:31now if you're new to my channel you're like what
1:34so this aftershave balm contains a lot of glycerin and glycerin makes products
1:39stick to it
1:41so if you apply this is your base the glycerin in this will keep your makeup
1:45on all day and after working it in for a while you will feel becoming tacky and
1:52then it's what you want
1:53after that I like to follow through with my smashbox primer water for foundation
1:58I'm using this kogan dell'acqua foundation into 13 and mixing it a
2:03little bit with the Kogan dough and moisture foundation in 20 12 and to
2:10apply it i'm using my morphe e6 brush
2:16you want to apply this in a nice stippling motion
2:28for concealer and we use the urban decay naked skin concealer in fair neutral and
2:34first just underneath my eyes and then go crazy and applied wherever you think
2:40you need it
2:42war paint and then with my Real Techniques sponge and blending that in
3:00then setting up with powder to prevent it from creasing the first thing i'll be
3:06doing is applying a base to my list to prevent everything from creasing and for
3:11this I'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and i'm using is away the concealer
3:15buffer brush for this
3:16the first I should i'm going to go in with is by understand early hills and
3:21this called orange soda and this color will act as our transition for inner
3:25crease and amusing a morphy em 5044 this as the main color i'll be using love +
3:34by sugarpill and with a morph em5 13
3:38i'm just applying that to the crease
3:48and I'm barely touching my skin with the brush and because of that you will get a
3:54really nice blend on its own
3:57of course it will need some more blending later on but just slightly
4:01touching the skin it will do most of the work for you then here on the outer
4:06corner you want to wing it out a little bit
4:08you can always go back in with the orange soda and diffuse the edges
4:16i'm also concentrating the red on the outer portion of my lid
4:22now for the lid i'm going to use the max new dazzle shadow in
4:28let's roll because the shadows are kind of hard to work with as a base
4:32i'm going to use a glitter glue this is by lit and this is a clearly liquid
4:37glitter base and we use this as a base of the shadow over top and that will
4:41really make it pop
4:53and with the tiniest bit of Anasazi Beverly Hills rich velvet I'm just
4:57darkening the corners and the crease
5:07for the lower lash line i am first applying love plus the sugar pill again
5:11and this time with a mac - 28
5:17then with a mac - 13 I'm softly blending the edges then with rich velvet and the
5:24morphe em 508
5:26I'm just darkening the roots of my lower lashes to highlight the inner corners
5:30I'm taking to make a peak oil
5:32I shadows this is whimsical and where am I in the spotlight now with a little bit
5:43of black eyeshadow and be more fiji 28
5:46I'm just darkening the roots of my top lashes on the waterline i'm applying
5:52this hourglass 1.5 mechanical gel liner in obsidian just to you know get the
5:58smoky effect going all you want to do now is finish off with mascara on top
6:05and bottom lashes and some falsies and the falsies of using today are by lena
6:10lashes and these are called Bianca and if you use code
6:14nikkietutorials at checkout you will get fifty percent off to warm up my face and
6:21first going in with this mac bronzer and give me son and just start bronzing up
6:25your complexion
6:29the contrary i'm using heroin eyeshadow by illamasqua and for this amusing a

0:15hey guys so today i am doing a tutorial as always
0:21today I'm doing a tutorial on this warm toned smokey eye look I was super
0:25inspired because next monday here in holland it is kings day
0:30therefore the orange background this is sort of an homage to my duchies I've
0:35done a couple of kings and queens day tutorials in the past before but this
0:40year I wanted to make it super wearable and sexy and smoky and appropriate for
0:45mine under she's also because i want everyone to be able to do warm tone
0:49smokey eyes see if without any further ado if you want to know how to get these
0:53warm tone smokey eyes perfect for kings day as well then please keep watching
0:59so the first thing I'm doing is always is applying a base to my limits to
1:02prevent everything from creasing and for this obvious my mac soft ochre Paint Pot
1:07the first action i'll be using today is cocoa bear by makeup geek I'm just
1:14starting off by softly placing this into my crease kind of push it in there and
1:23wiggle around and then once it's on start blending and diffusing that out
1:30now i'm taking makeup geeks peach smoothie and mixing this in with cocoa
1:38bear and with that mixture you're dragging the crease more towards the
1:43inner part of your crease so this is outer part this is inner part so with a
1:49softer shade of warm brown we're going on the inside of the crease now with
1:58peach smoothie only i'm going to soften the edges just lightly now taking the
2:07unassessably hills artists palette and taking this color right here or into
2:11fancy and that color is going onto the inner third of my eyelid
2:20i'm also placing this right here sort of the outer third of my lid for the center
2:31i'll be using this makeup geek fold eyeshadow in in the spotlight and blend
2:41it with the orange for the lower lash time we're basically mimicking what we
2:46did on top so I'm first going in with cocoa bear by makeup geek and applying
2:51this to my outer corners then also high in colbert on the inner corners and
3:04putting in the spotlight right in the center and with orange you fancy i'm
3:11going right in between the two for my eyeliner today I'm using a necessity
3:18briefly hills a liquid lipstick in vamp and the liquid lipsticks by on the cyber
3:22bully Hills actually make the best liquid eyeliners and I personally will
3:31be doing the wing for this look but if you feel like doing the wing then do it
3:35to bring back a little bit of that orange element I'm taking another liquid
3:39lipstick by on says Beverly Hills this is persimmon and mixing it with vamp and
3:45that together we will create a really warm warm brown and that is going right
3:49on the center of the eyeliner
3:56to open up my eyes and using a little bit of mix milk eyepencil doing this
4:01off-camera and all you want to do now to finish is apply mascara and false ease
4:05and falses i'll be using rvs by house of lashes these are called the temptress
4:10lashes for cheeks i'm going to highlight using my Keaveney shade and light
4:17pellets
4:24the Browns my skin i'm using this L'Oreal glam bronze in number one
4:39for blush I'm using Mac speeches
4:48then to highlight our first going in with Rebecca press shimmering skin
4:52Perfector in rose gold in a bigger brush and this is going to act as a glow all
4:57over and then with moonstone later on and really going to intensify everything
5:01so taking a little bit of rose gold and popping that on the tops of the cheeks
5:07nose just everywhere really
5:13and as I said with moonstone only i'm really going to highlight
5:27and that's safe for the cheeks or lips I want to go for nude and Matt so the
5:32first liquid lipstick i'll be using is my honest as early Hills this is called
5:36pure Hollywood
5:53and then on the center i'll be applying milkshake
6:05yeah
6:10and that guy's concludes my warm tone smokey eye makeup tutorial which fits

0:16hey guys so today i'll be doing a tutorial on Jennifer Lopez's performance
0:21on american idol from her new single field the lights
0:24Jennifer looked like a goddess no she looked like a twink Ling dazzling
0:30goddess fairy itself up
0:34no words i was absolutely dying overlooked it was so sparkly
0:39so intensely gorgeous i I just knew I had to recreate it for you see I without
0:45any further ado if you want to know how to get the sparkly JLo look right here
0:49then please keep on watching
0:51alright guys so I already went ahead ended my foundation concealer browse and
0:54all that stuff and it also already applied a base to my eyelids to prevent
0:58everything from creasing now onto the first I shadow this is by understand
1:02perfectly hills this is called bone and I find blue eye shadows to be one of the
1:08hardest colors to blend so little trick is to take a light colored eyeshadow a
1:13new tone and brush it all over your eyelids and that will make blending
1:18easier so just with bone just going all over my eyes now for the blue and the
1:29crazy i'll be using two eyeshadows the first one is by officers roughly hills
1:33this is called star blue and also be using this fold eyeshadow by makeup geek
1:37and this is called center stage now really slowly start blending these two
1:43colors into your crease now again I find blue to be one of the hardest colors to
1:50work with so you want to go little by little
1:53don't rush yourself take all the time you need for blending I want to keep the
1:57artery edge more of a rounded shape as opposed to a more angular and wing shape
2:03so I'm just going to keep it soft and follow the curves of my crease a little
2:07by little star working your way into the inner part of your crease just really
2:16smoothly and lightly blend that in take your time then to make the blend a
2:22little bit smoother going to go in with another on the says Beverly Hills
2:25eyeshadow this is called stone with the center stage only
2:29to intensify the blue a little bit for the lid i'll also be making a mixture of
2:36to us directly hills eyeshadows the first one is gold rush and the second
2:41one is suede and as I said this is just going onto the lid blending into the
2:48blue
2:58alright then for the lower lash line and again taking center stage and that is
3:02going from the outer corner to about half way in then because I don't want to
3:13make the lower lash line to stark into cool toned and bringing in some warmth
3:18using this eyeshadow by makeup geek this is called latte
3:28I'm taking center stage again and going over top
3:34all right now it's time for that insane sparkle i'm going to take this makeup
3:40studio jewel effect in sparkle and literally i'm going to dust this all
3:45over my eyeballs and not just on the eyelids everywhere
3:59therefore even more shine and sparkle makeup videos jewel sex and shine and
4:04this is going on the inner corners and the brow bone
4:13I'm going to line my waterline using Mac's pression I'm cutting this out
4:16because students in camera is unfortunately ugly and all you want to
4:20do now is eyeliner and we're first going to create a little tiny point on the
4:25inner corner to elongate the eyes and then follow along the lashline and no
4:30wing
4:40all going to do now is apply mascara and false lashes and then we'll be back
4:45right for cheeks first we need a little bit of contouring and for that I'll be
4:49using my own desk eyeshadow in heroin into further warm up my face and taking
5:01this birch wob what's called Matt illusion bronzing powder in number 21

0:22hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial on the look I was wearing in my March
0:27hits and Oh God knows you guys my bar to me with requests for that look so today
0:32i am here doing it for you
0:34it's a very monotone earthy brown toned makeup look with this super-intense cat
0:40eyeliner and just the lips and just the everything it's super glam yet still
0:44edgy and different and monotone so monotone cat eyes see without any
0:52further ado if you want to know how to get this look right here then keep on
0:55watching
0:57so I already went ahead and did my base foundation so I used my foundation
1:01concealer did browse all that it's now time to do the first thing for the eyes
1:06I'm first putting down a base
1:08I'm taking my mac software could paint pot and this will prevent everything
1:11from creasing now i'm just taking a light-colored matte eyeshadow and with a
1:21big fluffy blending brush
1:23this is going all over and this will help make blending easier
1:27the first I shall be using is a fun by unsaved early Hills
1:32no no what are you doing and really simply i'm defining my crease with this
1:40and you can go for a winged eye shape on the outer edge you can go round it i'm
1:46just following the natural curves and hugging the natural curves of Mike
1:50wreath
1:55yeah
2:02then with a big fluffy blending brush and still using fun
2:06I'm just blending that out even more making it look seamless for the lower
2:10lash line I'm again taking fun and what people seem to love so much is that the
2:15lower lash line was very smoky and champion dark
2:19so go ahead and blend this as far down as you like now going in on assessing
2:27briefly Hilson smoke
2:29eyeshadow and just deepening that outer corner for the little using makeup geeks
2:38foiled eyeshadow in grandstand first applying the majority of it with my
2:43finger
2:44I feel like I get most coverage using my fingers and then perfecting with a brush
2:50now it's time for the key feature of this look
2:58the cat eyeliner so I'm first going in with my cavity tattoo liner in trooper
3:02just to make my outline and i'll fill in is in my NYC black liquid liner just
3:08because i love sort of mapping out the shape with captain d and I like the
3:13madness and the opaqueness of the NYC one and that is why use that to fill it
3:18in
3:18then from that long you want to drag it back onto your lid as close to the inner
3:26corner as you can then what I like to do next is focused on that cat flick
3:34so I just place the cavity tattoo liner in my like it might tear duct area like
3:40directly into my i drag it out and that creates a line and from there you can
3:45finish the whole thing off
3:51from here you can drag this side back into the eye and from here you connected
3:57to the eyeliner so once you've got the outline all you want to do is fill in
4:09between the lines
4:19ok from there to give the crease a little bit more of a cut feel like a cup
4:23crease
4:24I'm taking on the says he readily hills smoke again and because i want to warm
4:28the shade a little bit up because I feel like it's a little bit too ashy for a
4:32look
4:33I'm mixing it with a little bit of caramel and then that shade is going
4:38right into the crease from that wing you want to bring it into the crease all the
4:46way to the inner corner like a cut crease and blend it out softly that way
4:53you give your crease a little bit more definition and define meant without
4:59actually cutting your crease
5:01once you've got that you're done all you want to do now is the PI mascara and
5:05just some false lashes today I'll be isn't build these are the pixi luck by
5:10house of lashes but first mascara
5:30all right onto cheeks the first thing i'll be doing is giving myself a lovely

0:04glowy flashy nude free hair just go natural today I felt like doing this
0:12super wearable easy to do
0:14natural makeup look that super glowy and I think very flattering plus i also
0:19included how I got this very free curly hair I really this is how the styling my

0:30sure you please stay tuned and if you want to know how to get this then please
0:36stay tuned
0:37alright so to get myself started today I'm first going in with the dior glow
0:41maximizer and it's just an illuminating base and that is exactly what i want for
0:46this look because i want to go no no I can
0:48angel oh dear oh that's a globe now for foundation I thought really long and
0:54hard on this and this look today is more of a soft look but still I want my base
1:00to look on fleek and gotten a lot of comments that my basis sometimes too
1:05perfect
1:06but you know what I'd rather have my base looking perfect then not so perfect
1:11so today I'm going to make a mixture of my benefit hello flawless foundation in
1:16pure for sure ivory and just to give it a little bit more fish
1:19I'm going to take the cross island TV pin sick in g 191
1:23so first i'm going in with the benefit foundation and then wherever I need more
1:27i apply the cryo and TV paint stick
1:41there now go ahead and highlight today I'm going to use my mac pro longwear in
1:45NC 15 and my crew on TV pin stick in 4062 highlights but if you feel like a
1:52lot of foundation + concealer is too much for you then by all means
1:57skip that do you you do you I'm going to do me
2:13and now quickly setting everything with powder so it will increase
2:20so now i'm going to quickly do my brows and one I off camera and that it will be
2:27back
2:28okay so four eyes were going to keep this very easy quick and simple and
2:32silly little glamorous and last year so it's always the first thing I'm doing is
2:36priming my eyelids to prevent any creasing from happening
2:40and for this I'm using my software group in part by Mac them from my tartare
2:44lapel and i'm going to take this color right here and I'm applying the shade of
2:48right into my crease and up to my brow bone and what this will do is it will
2:53help blend out the crease color that will place on later it will help let
2:59those out easier and smoother
3:01so from the same palette i'm going to go into wonderer and with this i'm just
3:05going to start defining the outer parts of my crease a little bit more just to
3:09get more definition and depth so ride into the crease focus applying wonderer
3:18and bring it in about half way in now my eye shape greatly benefits from a
3:25rounded outer corner but if your eyes benefit from a v-shaped outer corner
3:31by all means do that so I'm going to drag the brown on to my outer corner and
3:38rounded out then picking up a little bit more of wonder on a big blending brush
3:47we're just going to diffuse and blend out this define - because it's
3:53definitely way too harsh now and we wanted to be soft and hazy for the
3:58living room using color pops XO super shock shadow and for some extra glam
4:07over top i'm applying the the bomb overshadow whatever in and no money no
4:12honey it's a pigment and
4:14right over top XO just for some extra glam and shine
4:20I don't wanna go too far with the lower lash line so again taking that crease
4:24color and really slightly defining the roots of my lower lashes and then to
4:33open up the eyes and devise a wide awake feel I'm taking my bed nine neutralizer
4:38cream crayon and that is going on the waterline
4:41all right to finish up the eyes all you need is some mascara on your top lashes
4:45only if you prefer mascara on your bottom lashes also that
4:48by all means go ahead and do that I find that my eyes look more natural without
4:53anything on the lower lashes so going to do that and falsies
4:58I wanted to be super lash e so i'm going to go with the siren lashes by house of
5:02lashes to give the I a fun and unique look I'm going to take a little bit of
5:06black eyeshadow and a really tiny tiny TV brush I'm going to place that right
5:11here where the lash stops right next to the roots of my lower lashes to the
5:16inner . of my eye so to speak and then once i reach that inner corner
5:22I drag it out a little bit as if you would do an inner corner cat . like with
5:26the Arabian style smokey eyes and then just leave that line there and it just
5:30makes your eyes look so cat-like and defined and i really like this for
5:42cheeks today I want to keep it soft glowy and very flushed
5:46so first going to contract just a tiny teeny bit using heroin eyeshadow by
5:50illamasqua there's a warm of my complexion a little bit i'm taking my
5:58macro find golden bronzer or blush today I'm using bobby brown's pink coral just
6:08to give that flesh that pop of cheek and for a highlighter of course better
6:15shimmering skin Perfector press two moons
6:18and let's go glowy up in heel
6:32for lips the first using Mac's a little pencil in boldly bear just to give
6:36myself a little bit more depth and volume and then for the lip gloss and
6:46making a mixture with honest as a perfectly hills lip gloss the new lip
6:50gloss is amusing - I'm using a dainty and undressed and together this is like
6:56the perfect nude gloss
6:58it's so everything so I'm putting dainty on my top lip and undressed on the lower
7:08lip and then to mix them all you want to do is smack them lips together girl
7:16and that concludes the makeup now on to the hair
7:20so for my hair today I'm using the new new me tighten three curling iron set it
7:25comes with three curling wands and this is the medium one
7:29this is the small of course we got our big one
7:32so it comes to three wines and today I'm going to start off by using the medium
7:37sized curling wand I actually used it to curl the hair of my model for a campaign
7:41to yesterday and it rocked my socks off
7:45I created such a full glamorous voluminous hair do for that shoot using
7:50this curling set and a 1 not use it in my video today and not only do i think
7:55it is an absolute great quality but the fact that it has a three ones it's
8:00perfect for beginners out there because you don't have to buy three separate
8:04curling irons it also comes with a heat protectant glove if you're not used to
8:08curling hair with one of these curling ones and this is great because i
8:13actually burned my finger because i forgot to put the glove on top of the
8:18glove on it heats up to 200 Celsius degrees which is hot
8:23so again use the glove and there's a little push the button right here and
8:28that will release the wand
8:30so I'm going to go for the medium one so I'm taking the medium one and then you
8:34just click it on
8:36I thought I'm just going to go ahead and give myself some soft waves today so
8:40we're just going to part a little section of
8:43we're going to take it brush it
8:46the hand that is curling the hair around the curling wand should have the glove
8:52on it
8:53hold it like this and then I wrap the hair around and then I bring it all the
9:00way to the ends and keep it there so I'm not starting all the way at the roots
9:05and really just curling the ends and i'm just going to sit for about 10 seconds
9:10and then for this section of hair right in front of it so the new section we
9:14grab you want to curl it in words
9:17so we go from outwards inward away from the face to the face away from the base
9:22to the base so grab it across all the way to the end and hold it and then we

0:37grammys inspired makeup look then please stay tuned
0:40ok guys so the first thing i'll be doing is applying a base of violence to

0:48and I literally have like one or two uses left which I'm shitting my pants
0:53because i have like a big event tomorrow and I need my soft ochre and we focus on
0:59my I the first I shall be using is by on accessibility hills and this is stone
1:04and a little miss stone is going to be my transition shade so this is going
1:09right in the crease and blending up and out
1:13once you reach that outer corner here just going to flick your brush to decide
1:19like this
1:21ok and then with a bigger fluffy blending brush I'm going to drag that
1:26onto the in your corner and kind of rounded out right here
1:30then on the outer third of my living them to take on accessibility hills in
1:34Emerald i'm just applying the street to the outer third and then with another
1:41clean blending brush I'm going to diffuse the edges into that outer V that
1:46we just created right here
1:48blended into the mix make it one
1:54our next color is going to be on the fuzzy briefly hills moss and i'm
1:57applying this color straight onto the lid to the middle so from emerald it
2:02goes into moss
2:04you just want to apply it their all the way up to the crease
2:09kind of go towards those inner corners also but not all the way kind of leave
2:13some space open for now I'm taking the next my pencil in cottage I mean Nikki
2:18tutorials that and this is going straight on to that inner tear duct area
2:24and then with unessential Beverly Hills soft gold I'm going over top and this is
2:30also a shadow used by her makeup artist and so I'm taking a pencil brush and
2:35going over top of the jumbo pencil by NYX to really get that highlight going
2:40because I feel like Kim's look was all about the highlight and the glow and the
2:45illumination and then also you want to apply it onto that inner third of the
2:50lid blending into that Moss color for the lower lash line you want to take
2:54moss again and that is going from outer to inner corner and then i'm applying a
3:03little bit of emerald on the outer corners to darken it and sauce called on
3:10the inner corners
3:20now to grab the look I'm going to use an eyeliner and today I'm using campanis
3:24tattoo liner in trooper just to get my outline and you want to start out by
3:28creating a line aiming towards the end of your eyebrows and then from there
3:32drag it back onto the lid and then what I like to do now is drag it all the way
3:39to the inner corners then also to elongate the eyes you want to extend the
3:48inner corner just a tiny bit and then I'll filling everything in with my NYC
3:55black liquid liner
3:59all right all you want to do now to complete the eyes is apply some cold to
4:03the waterline i'm using max power surge
4:06I'm going to do this off camera because doing this on camera is a living hell
4:10and then now all you have to do is a pie little bit of mascara to top and bottom
4:14lashes and some faults is of course we're talking to Kim Kardashian here and
4:17i'm using the house of lashes temptress wispy
4:30yeah
4:31for chicks it wouldn't be a Kardashian video if you're gonna go all the way
4:35with contouring blush and glow and all the magics on the face
4:39so first going to contour my face using my LS guy shadow in heroin and i'm going
4:44to use a mixture of two brushes i'm going to use these away by 109 because a
4:48lot of people told me that I should try this
4:50after hating the NARS one and then also my trusty old Mac 163 just because it
4:57works for me
4:58now this i do like pollen Ouya you can make like super sharp stripes with it
5:04and then blend up this is like a hardcore contour brush if you're feeling
5:09like getting them cheekbones carved out like no other
5:13this is your brush that this is what the nurse eater brush was supposed to do for
5:18me that you further bronze up my face i'm going to use the mac refined golden
5:22bronzing powder and with my makeup studio as a one brush never blush
5:29Mario on his Instagram told everyone that the blush used on Kim was nars
5:34orgasm
5:35so why not use that one
5:41and lastly for highlighter i'm going to use of the bomb
5:46mary-lou manizer
5:55yeah
5:57and that's it for cheeks
5:59Kim's lips were super nude and glossy so first going to give myself a little bit
6:03more volume and plump using the design pro lip pencil in mehran more on them
6:15for lipstick i'm going to use macs a flash pot and then as a gloss

0:58look without any further ado if you want to know how to get this Gwen Stefani
1:03Valentine's Day night inspired makeup look that police say two top
1:08alright guys so as always the first thing i'll be doing is applying a base
1:10to prevent everything from creasing and i'm using my soft ochre Paint Pot which
1:15is almost done and with days away but 142 and just buffing this into my lids
1:22the first crease color are we using is warm taupe by Anasazi berkeley hills and
1:27the brush I'm using for this is a zueva - 27 you first want to focus on the
1:33outer half of your lid so actually placing the brush onto the lid and then
1:38from there you want to flick it into the outer crease right here and then start
1:46blending it out and diffusing that color
1:52as your blending it out you can see that it's starting to build the definition
1:59and it's starting to shape the I then taking a massage and Beverly Hills a
2:03nude and i'm blending this lightly above the brown that we just placed and also
2:09towards the inner crease right here
2:13so the new color is really really light but it still gets the tiniest bit of
2:17definition on my fair skin tone for the living to take this amazing bh cosmetics
2:22a while child palette i am loving this
2:25and the color are we using for my lid is this white shimmery color here and this
2:30pinky color
2:31up top and with a sigma f 70
2:34I'm just placing that on to my lids and I am obsessing over this color right
2:40here is just such a vivid glamorous nude color I love this bh pallid they come in
2:47three types and the wild child is my favorite because it's got all these new
2:51d colors and the pink and the purple and the peachy is a great great palate and
2:55they look awesome apply dry but i will apply a color to my lower lashline wet
3:01damp and it's just out of this world chrome heaven
3:04it's amazing to warm up my outer feet a little bit more and taking this new
3:08color pop super shock cheek in Swift and just a tiny bit of that goes again on
3:15that outer corner and this is to bring in some warmth for the lower lash i'm
3:21going to take this color right here and apply it with a damp brush and then
3:28immediately right after with a dry brush go over top with that same color and
3:34that will sort of kick it up really nicely and they will give it that super
3:38awesome chrome finish to further highlight the inner corners I'm taking

4:22my NYC black liquid liner to fill this all in
4:31and with that i'm also going to slightly extend my wing a little bit and that's
4:40it for the eyeliner what I'm not going to do is open my eyes by using a nude
4:44light colored eye pencil this is the been nine neutralizer clean crayon in
4:49ultra lights and then just going to pop this on to my waterline I'm going to be
4:53out of frame because this is impossible to do on camera
4:56now all that is left to do is to finish off the eyes by using a lick of mascara

0:14hey guys thank you so much for watching today i'm bringing you a tutorial
0:18inspired by lady gaga at the 2015 grammys the red carpet look I thought
0:24that lady gaga I looked absolutely stunning it was by far my most favorite
0:29makeup look of the entire evening and I know before y'all get crazy on me again
0:34guess the biggest back I'm doing the lady gaga tutorial here today guides
0:39lady gaga lady gaga the life support our wigs and I kind of get why this week
0:44bothers you because of the dark roots but i'm getting the dark roots fixed
0:48next week say without any further ado if you want to know how to get this lady
0:52gaga look right here then please stay tuned
0:55all right so I already put down the base to pretend everything from creasing and
0:59now it's time to move on to the first I shadow the first I should i'll be using
1:03is caramel by an associate beverly hills and i'm applying this color on the outer
1:09crease a little bit higher up than I would usually place my crease color and
1:14this is for some transition and warmth
1:18because you get to police the on God that she had all these cool tone shades
1:22going on but then in the crash at this warmth
1:25so I'm just going to place this here and then also wing it out
1:28and of course it wouldn't be a goggle look if we didn't go all the way to the
1:33inner corners
1:35now i'm going to go into max plumage and this will be used as the winged shape so
1:41with an angled brush I'm going to create a line that is going towards the end of
1:44my eyebrow you want to go high up goggles line almost reached the end of
1:49her eyebrows so it's totally fine to go high up and go extreme with this one and
1:56then from that line go ahead and pull it back to the lid and of course fill in
2:05using that same color
2:07then I'm going to blend that out with a pencil brush using the same mac color
2:11but also mixing it with a little bit of a necessity of Beverly Hills mermaid and
2:16literally all you want to do is grab that pencil brush and diffuse the edges
2:21of the line that you just created and for now it doesn't have to be super
2:25precise on the lid
2:27but the close to you come to word the point of the eyeliner you want to keep
2:31it really tiny and need to precise
2:37so just keep lending and making it soft and diffused for the lid him first going
2:43in with this color pop super shock shadow in sugar and this bad boy is
2:48going on to the center of the lid so plumage and mermaid kind of stopped here
2:53and then from there you want to continue using sugar and then going over top with
2:59honest as a Beverly Hills
3:00I see there for me in her third and inner corners and going to take a legend
3:06also buy omnicef early Hills who's going right on that inner third and inner
3:13corners now going back into plumage by mac and then to create a more definite
3:20line
3:21so right now it's all kind of like healing and we're getting there but i
3:24want a super defined line as if it's an eyeliner going way up now for the lower
3:34lash line again taking plummet and we're running this as i said on the lower lash
3:40line but you want to connect it to that eyeliner part ride here just connected
3:47to it and then what you want to do is drag it towards the inner corners then
3:53i'm taking mermaid and I see by honestly berkeley hills again and smoking it out
3:58all right now what really made this look where the sparkles and the sparkles were
4:07all over and i love that so I'm going to take my dual effects and shine my makeup
4:11studio and I'm going to dazzle it all over the light parts of the eye
4:22and that's it for the eyeshadows i'm not going to apply some mascara
4:26do you give a base for my lashes and the lashes i'll be using our right of the
4:30lower and these are the adult meet up for the cheeks Gaga didn't really have a
4:39whole lot going on so i'm gonna do is bronze and warm of my complexion a bit
4:43using some contouring powder and bronzer the blushes and highlighters first part
4:47is i'm going to use is always is my heroine eyeshadow by illamasqua then to
4:57further warm of my complexion and taking the two-faced at milk chocolate bronzer
5:01then for blush and then use a shocker Luminoso and then to highlight my
5:13complexion
5:14i'm going to use the becca shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone using mine
5:18ours either brush after my January hits and God knows a lot of people told me
5:23that the nurse either brush is perfect for highlighting so I'm gonna give it a
5:27go to digg when bam bam bam
5:33I mean it's okay
5:36alright so what I think of it is that i have to dip into my highlighting powder
5:40a lot more with the nurse eda as opposed to my England for SS brush so so far
5:46i I'm just really not a fan of this brush I'm sorry I'm also just going to
5:51highlight the bridge of my nose tip of my nose keeps both the works that the
5:55further cheeks
5:56all right last step is the lips that you don't really want to overdraw the lips
6:01with the pence or anything you just want to New them out to get a really nice
6:04fleshy skin new tone and after that i'll be using Mac's flash pot and then you
6:14sort of what this natural flush of a gloss over top and the product that
6:18totally rang my bell for the book was the bourgeois color burst in color
6:26births it all faded off because I've had it for so long but the color is peach on
6:31the beach and it's one of those glossy bombs that just ask the tiniest bit of
6:35color
6:36it still gives the color and sheen and flush
6:39so this is going right over top and that's the guys that concludes my lady

2:13transition shade so i'm going to apply this right into the crease and i'm using
2:19a zueva - 27 for this and i'm also going to go ahead and come to the inner corner
2:26of my crease sort of speak

3:46sick rabbit
3:47no we just want to diffuse the line a little tiny bit so it makes it look a
3:52little bit more like a haze
3:54ok not to highlight the inner corners I'm again taking my new obsession

4:02they call this cottage cheese and just dab this onto the very inner corner and
4:08then i'm going to go over with a shimmering pink

0:16Super Bowl halftime show I absolutely loved Katie's look it was like pinup
0:22showgirl on sleek can we talk about Missy Elliott's anyways without any
0:26further ado if you want to learn how to get this makeup look right here then
0:30please stay tuned
0:31alright so the first thing i'll be doing for my face is applying my primary /
0:35base for the glow for the globe to happen so the first product i'll be
0:39using is by to face and this is d hangover replenishing face primer and
0:44forgive myself that glow i'm using the becca shimmering skin Perfector in pearl
0:49so this mixture is going arrived on to the face
0:54ok then for foundation I'm going to take the mac face and body in c1 and the mac
0:59studio sculpt in NC 15 and a subscriber commented on one of my last videos that
1:04this combo is awesome so I tried it and she was super duper and it's totally
1:09awesome
1:10it gives your face it really nice glowy filled with still covers and makes you
1:13look flawless so I'm going to be mixing of these two together and that will be
1:17my foundation and then loving it in with a brush and the brush I'm using is by
1:21Sigma and it's the f88 ok once you've got that i'm going to conceal and using
1:31my pro longwear by mac and i'm applying this right underneath my eyes to
1:36highlight along the bridge of my nose forehead basically basically everywhere
1:43if he can panty any makeup fine not here and I'm taking my Real Techniques sponge
1:49and i'm blending this all in
1:56and then quickly going to set that using my secret brightening powder right lower
2:01marche ok so first things first I'm first applying a base to my list to
2:09prevent everything from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint pop for
2:13this then with a large shadow brush and a light colored eyeshadow running this
2:22from the crease up to my brow bone and what this will do is help blend out the
2:27crease color easier prettier and better the first crease color on the take comes
2:34from the tart tart with pellet and it's this grayish color right here and with
2:39a's away by 227 i'm going to start applying this to the crease and we're
2:44not really cutting the crease but we definitely do want a prominent crease so
2:50go ahead and carve in the crease right here then I also go ahead and wing that
2:55out just slightly there with a light gray color I'm going to diffuse the
3:02edges and make it look more soft and the item using comes from these away for
3:07smokey eyeshadow palette and it's this grayish color right here for the living
3:14taking this color by on associate early hills and this is Blanc just pack it
3:19onto the lid and for this I'm using a zoeva 234
3:27for the inner corner I'm taking this NYX jumbo pencil in cottage cheese as my
3:32base and i'm going to set that using makeup videos dual effects and shine for
3:42the lower lash on taking this brown from the tartlet pellet and this goes from
3:47inner to outer corner and then with a pencil brush I'm going to defuse that
3:58out and blended a little bit more down and then now it's time for the winged
4:06liner and the glitter liner so first I'm taking my cabinet tattoo liner in
4:11trooper to lay down a base for my eyeliner and you want to go thick and
4:15bold
4:23yeah
4:25I'm going to fill this in using the NYC black liquid liner and therefore the
4:38glitter what you want to do is create your own glitter eyeliner a can do this
4:42by mixing a glitter adhesive with the glitter so I'm taking the lit clearly

1:16first you want to focus most of it on the outer part of your eyes and then
1:20keeping the shape quite rounded on the outer edges and then whatever is left on
1:26the brush
1:27I start applying closer to the inner corners of my eyes and making that nice
1:31rounded shape also now i'm going to go in makeup geeks oils eyeshadow in
1:36flamethrower and this is going on to the outer third of my eyes
1:41blending in with that rounded crew shape so you want to flick it up and then with

1:51crease a little bit for the lid on taking make a week spoiled eyeshadow in
1:55grandstand and this is going right next to flame thrower onto the lid blending
2:01up to the crease also and you can go as far in as you like with this one
2:08after these very inner corners of the lids I'm taking this color pop super
2:13shock shadow and I heart this
2:16oh and the first have been applying all these with issy 234 by the way ova

2:52brown and i'll be applying this on the outer corner of my lower lash line and
2:56the first time using is the 237 by the way for any dark brown will work
3:01you just want to darken this part right here up a bit because it will give it a
3:05little bit more definition to the eyes and make it ground and look more
3:09wearable for the awesome in a corner sparkle and first laying down a base
3:13with my NYX jumbo pencil in cottage cheese and i love this for a very fair
3:18skin tone to highlight the inner corners with because there's not a lot of
3:22products that actually reflect on us
3:25I like putting this down as a base to really catch the light and then to
3:29really spark it up and taking my jewel effects and shine by makeup studio and
3:33that is going right over top
3:35now with an angled brush and a dark dark brown almost black shadow
3:41I'm running it across my lash line to ground the lashes a little bit more and
3:45to make my false lashes blend in to finish off the eyes only to do now is
3:53the place in the scared to the top lashes only and some policies and the
3:58photos i'll be using today are by mac and these are the 36
4:09ok

4:27have a little bit of sculpting going on but I'm going to enhance that a little
4:31bit more using my illamasqua eyeshadow in heroin just to intensify it a little
4:38bit more and to make it look a little less orange
4:42Rihanna's cheeks looked really bronze in the picture so I'm going to go into
4:45refined a golden bronzer by mac and with this further warming up my complexion

5:15cheeks and then blending back into the contour and highlight I'm using my
5:21favorite highlighting powder
5:23becca shimmering skin Perfector pressed in moonstone

5:33going up and once you've got that also the bridge of the nose that then we're
5:42going to take a pencil brush and dip it into the highlighting powder and i'm
5:46applying the highlighting powder to the very highest tip of my nose just to lift
5:51it
5:55then also go ahead and highlight that Cupid phone and then you're a
5:59highlighted God before those awesome dark brown lips are first going in with

0:48so my skin currently is dry as so i'm going to put an argan oil on this is by
0:54josie maran and this is the pure argan oil light's it's the light one
1:00oh my god is gonna so dry oh hey them so disappointing you and the other products
1:06have been really liking to punch up my dry skin is the two-faced hangover
1:11primer on this smells heavily it has coconut water
1:16electrolytes and probiotics in it
1:20sure and this also is great for if you are having a little bit of a rough skin
1:27de que on to foundation so I've been trying to make sure out for a couple of
1:31days and i'm really liking it
1:33it's a mixture of the Studio Fix fluid by mac and the cavity lucky tattoo
1:37foundation
1:39and light 42 and i'm just going to . this mixture onto my face and I'll be
1:46buffing this in using my Sigma f80 688 baby eight
1:59so because we're doing smokey is inspired by jlo chances are that these
2:03smoky colors the dark colors will drop down onto her face and create bought a
2:09little trick it's the first year for nation
2:11then do your browse to your eyes and then once you reach the bottom portion
2:16of your eyes you first put concealer and all that on so that you will not have
2:20any cloud
2:21so what I'm going to do now is do my brows off camera and then it will be
2:25back
2:26so I already put down my base is my mac soft ochre Paint Pot and the first thing
2:30I'm going to do now is taking a light matte eyeshadow I'm taking this color by
2:35these Oh Ava smoky eyeshadow palette because it suits my skin tone a lot and
2:40in order to get this blending to be on fleek you want this blending to be
2:44perfect
2:45a little trick is to put down a net-like color all over the ice first and then
2:50whatever you put on top glides is so much easier and blends is so much easier
2:55so that's a great trick
2:57so I'm taking the light color and it's going all over my eyes from lid two
3:05brow-bone the former transition shades the colors i'll be using our by makeup
3:09geek in unexpected the shape right here and also day raised by Anasazi Beverly
3:15Hills
3:16so I'm just taking the two and tilting my brush up and then smooth this in to
3:22the crease and this is going from outer to inner corners because J Lo has really
3:27nice deep set eyes and we want to mimic that plus her makeup artist when all the
3:33way in also and make it as smooth as possible because this will be our
3:37transition shade there now mixing day rate with purple rain by makeup geek and
3:42with this we are going to start defining that crease out even more
3:45so again same position for the brush and go right in that crease and start
3:52building the definition and smokiness
3:57where the lid him again taking two colors i'm mixing Anasazi Beverly Hills
4:05utopia with make a peek
4:07prom night I'm first laying this down using my finger and this is going all
4:14over the lid and then with a brush you can go back in and define now taking
4:22purple rain and a little bit of black eyeshadow i'm going to deepen the outer
4:26parts of my eye
4:27I'm not cleaning up my under eye area by using my foundation brush and getting
4:32rid of any fallout that i may have and then now it's time to do the concealer
4:37and then we can work on the lower lash line so I'm going to really quickly pop
4:40some concealer on
4:41ok now i'm going to go back into purple rain and running all the way along my
4:46lower lash line now with a pencil brush I'm going to soften the lines and make
4:58them
4:58ultra ultra smoky because they were super smoky on JLo now going in with the
5:04tiniest bit of black and running it straight to the base of the roots of my
5:07lower lashes
5:12time to darken that water line i'm taking my our class at one point five
5:16millimeter mechanical gel liner and then JLo was also rocking this super sexy
5:21inner corner eyeliner push it was very vixeny and kidney and it was very very
5:27sexy
5:28so I'm going to take my Kevin eat a two liner in trooper and i'm going to make
5:32just a really tiny teeny . on the inner corners just to elongate the eyes and
5:37make more cat shapes and then all we want to do now is run a little bit of
5:43black eyeshadow along the routes of my top lashes so it's a complete the look
5:54all you want to do now is the PI falsies and the ones i will be using our max 36
5:58lashes and these are perfect because on JLo you could definitely see that they
6:03are the art of corners really flared out and give that cat shaped feel again and
6:08these do that
6:09these do that all right time to get that j.lo glow I'm first going to contour
6:13using mobile using my eyeshadow by illamasqua in heroin is a new brush that
6:19I've been wanting to get for years and years never really got to it now I did
6:25the NARS e to brush this one better be good after all that hype underneath
6:30the cheekbone
6:35ok and then to further bronze i'm taking my to face that milk-chocolate light
6:40medium matte bronzer just warming up my face with this for blood shall be using
6:49the Lonnie's illumine oh so just because it goes with everything and jayla
6:54definitely had that really peachy glowy JLo glow and then give yourself that's
7:02super glow and go into becca shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone pressed dog
7:09and this is who basically almost going everywhere on the face
7:13first of all highest point of the cheekbones is a must
7:18Cupid's bow also a must in my humble opinion tip of the nose also a month
7:27JLo had a bridge of the news and this was a new one to me right in the middle
7:34just above the brows JLo had highlight ride here and that's that French shape
7:43so for the lips JLo word this really cool toned pinky nude color it was super
7:48super nude
7:49so we're going to mimic that but she also had a lot of volume with a lip
7:53pencils
7:54so I'm gonna make my lips look more full using the LA girl
7:57auto lip line you're in nude and a little bit of stone by Mac

5:03i bought these little things for nail art and in our little square it's called
5:09squares and I thought when you tilt them a little bit to the other direction they
5:14become like little diamonds
5:16so what I'm going to do is place one mini done of eyelash glue ripen eat the
5:20yellow and that is where i'm going to apply the little stud and then quickly
5:28taking a little bit of makeup studio jewel fix and shine and going over the
5:32yellow and the middle of my eyelids
5:34ok so that's it four eyes now going to apply some lashes
5:42these are the house of lashes iconix and then it will be back
5:46ok so far the cheeks i want to go contoured with a little bit of blush
5:50because my skin is looking very pale right now so i do want all the attention
5:55to still go to the eyes but a little bit of cheek is always good
5:59so first going to contour using my herring eyeshadow by l'a mascot
6:10then for blush I'm going to use a Luminoso by Milani and i'm applying this
6:14straight on to the apples of my cheeks really in the middle there for
6:23highlighter i'm going to use becca moonstone
6:26i I've been contemplating about bathing in this product
6:30I love it so much you just want to add that right here next to read that smoky
6:35eye stops and then blend it out and also here on the nose and then I'm actually
6:44quickly going to go back into heroin and I'm gonna define my Cupid's bow right
6:49here so everyone almost everyone naturally has a shadow right in between
6:54here and i'm going to really exaggerated that
7:06and therefore lips are going to keep them nude and then highlight with goals
7:09and added these things that are on my eyes to my lips
7:12also ok so for a lipstick i'll be using my hourglass fam new number one new
7:16lipstick
7:17then I'm going to take the colour-pop super shock shadow in get lucky which is
7:24a cool tone gold and i'm applying this to my Cupid's bow the top of my lip and
7:29the middle of my bottom lip
7:40and then again some lash glue and then three of those weird little squared of

4:19so thinking is so much for watching I hope you enjoyed and hopefully i'll see
4:23you guys on the next one
0:20hey guys so i recently watched the new music video by Iggy Azalea and jennifer
0:25lopez which is booty and oh my gosh
0:28dead ass so much as I did I couldn't
0:32oh my god these two ladies looked super smokin hot
0:36and I was like okay i need to find someone to do a crazy
0:41smoking hot collapse with and I saw my solution in crispy throw up your hands
0:46if you love a good collaboration see that today's video is inspired by jlo
0:51super gorgeous glowing skin their JLo glow and it's a super wearable look
0:57actually and crispy did her look inspired by Iggy so absolutely don't
1:01forget to check out krispies video I love your videos
1:04she's so talented and subscribe to her and show her some love
1:08but other than that I don't have anything else let's just go right ahead
1:11to this j.lo booty look first product i'm going to use is by L'Oreal and it's
1:16the Lumia chic pure light primer and this is a really light reflecting one
1:21and you could go for the becca shimmering skin Perfector in pearl but I
1:25find that this one right here by L'Oreal has just a little bit more shine to it
1:29and that is exactly what we want today so I'm taking that and blending it in to
1:35my skin for information today I'm again taking my benefit hello flawless oxygen
1:40while brightening makeup foundation
1:42I just because it just it's a beautiful and I'm the car and pure for sure
1:47ivory at first I'm just dotting that onto my face and then i'm taking my new
1:52favorite brush
1:53this is the stigma 3d HD brush and I'm taking a little bit of Evian facial
2:00spray and I'm going to spray the brush and then with the brush to start buffing
2:06in the foundation and what that Evian facial spray is going to do is it's
2:11going to make the brush a little bit more moist and this way its blending in
2:19the foundation in a much more natural way
2:22and every time you feel like your brush is starting to become a little bit more
2:25dry again just respray it every buffin now it's time for concealer and i'm
2:32using my trusty old
2:33mac pro longwear in NC 15 and i'm taking my sigma f 86 and the Evian spray once
2:42more spray it and buffing now I'm quickly going to set my under eye area I
2:51using SI shaping powder by mac and i'm going to do browse off-camera going to
2:56do this all off camera and then we'll be back
2:59ok so now onto eyes the first thing I'm doing is applying a base to my entire
3:04eye area to prevent the eye shadows from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre
3:10Paint Pot for this next I'm going in these songs books a tude palette and I'm
3:14making a mixture with three colors because i find that these three colors
3:18combines may just the perfect crease color for this look so I'm taking a
3:22little bit of caramel toffee and cream dream and with days away that - 20 a
3:28crease brush and just lightly feathering this in my crease
3:34I want this to be really soft and diffused
3:39so once i have most of the products on I will take it up a little bit higher and
3:45higher and higher
3:47I'm taking a little bit of Max emphasize shaping powder and with this i am
3:52highlighting my brow bone and I'm also taking a big and loading it up here on
3:59the inner corners because on JLo those inner corners were so bright and so
4:04intense you really want to lay focus there for the lid on mixing emphasize
4:10partner by Mac again and was a little bit of makeup geeks bling eyeshadow and
4:15as I said this is going onto my lid leading up to the crease and all the way
4:22to be outer corners
4:24what I like to do now is take a more concentrated brush at this is by the way
4:27if i did see - 31
4:29Lux petite crease and going back in my crease shadows and with the tips of the
4:34brush is slightly want to reapply their crease color and that will make it a
4:41little bit more concentrated as I said one of the main features of this look
4:45are those in 10
4:46inner corners so first laying down a bit of next eyeshadow in crystal avalanche
4:52you just want to pack that on that inner corner brightening that up and blending
5:01in a sort of V shape like this then going in with the most shimmering eye
5:06shadow of life
5:08nylon nation of my mac i'm taking a little moist brush and going over top
5:14and nylon damp is just the sparkliest glow easiest shut out of life
5:22ok I'm quickly going to go over to the bottom lash line and it looks super
5:26clean on jail yet still shit definition with those lashes so a little trick is
5:31to make your lower lashes pop we don't want any eyeshadow there is taking a
5:35really small and precise eyeliner for that personally I love to use the
5:39hourglass at 1.5 mechanical gel liner in obsidian and all you want to do is place
5:44a couple of dots on the roots of your lower lashes and then once you put
5:49mascara over top it just gives it way more definition
6:03so I'm aware of the fact that it looks super crazy right now but trust me once
6:07you put the scare over top it looks fine just I mean look at this side looks fine
6:12ok now to define my upper lash line a bit i'm going in my the bomb meets mad
6:17nude eyeshadow palettes and I'm going in the collar
6:20Matt's wood and with an angled brush i'm placing this super close to the roots of
6:27my lashes and slowly start building some definition there
6:33ok so once you've got most of that on you want to take a really small brush
6:38this is the pencil brush by makeup geek and a mixing net would with met rosen
6:43and all you want to do with this is smudge out that lying and make it really
6:51soft and diffused and smoky and lived in a on the waterline I'm quickly running
6:57some been nine year twice or cream crayon in ultralight MP 0 and then to
7:02finish off and curling my lashes and applying mascara and false lashes
7:06mascara is going to be the makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra black and
7:11therefore falsies i'm using these I don't know the brand but they're called
7:15Daisy and these days he wants our supernatural and that is exactly what
7:20you want to go for because JLo have really natural ones on also so I'm just
7:24going to pop this on right now and then we'll be back
7:26now onto cheeks the first thing i'll be doing is sculpting my cheekbones to make
7:30me look a little bit more you know
7:32j.lo and as always i'm using my msg eyeshadow in heroin for this energy is
7:38go to town and sculpt create those cheekbones
7:43but Daniel wasn't wearing any blush it was more so a lot of bronzer and a lot
7:48to lot of shine and glow
7:50so I'm just going to warm up my complexion a bit more using this
7:53bronzing powder by Mac this is called refined golden you kind of want to swirl
7:59it around on the high plains of your face and give yourself that sunkissed
8:04look I'm also gonna use it as a blush a little bit because there's not going to
8:08be any blush and then for that immaculate glow
8:11I'm of course going for my bed night looks from the air powder in
8:14I because this - it's my skin tone the best and this is what's going to give me
8:18the most glowy effect of all the highlighters that I have this doesn't
8:22really suit really dark skin tones nor medium skin tones I think so
8:27the darker of us can tell you are the more golden and bronze you want to go
8:31with your highlighter
8:32so Jennifer was super glowy like everything was a glow and we're even
8:37going in with a spray later on but the key focusing . you want to focus on when
8:42highlighting with a powder for this look is first tops of the cheekbones super
8:48super importance
8:49so right here sort of next to your eye
8:54oh we're going to get the glow up in here
8:57I'm gonna go a little bit further of course i'm taking a pencil brush and I'm
9:02highlighting my nose by just drawing a line in that little scoop here and onto
9:09the bridge of my nose and then on the highest tip of your nose
9:13please a little . highlighter like so and that is going to live the tip of
9:20your nose up now what I really noticed is that there is a lot of highlighter on
9:24the Cupid's bow but also on the highest point of the forehead and then as I said
9:31you also want to do
9:32cupids bow take a little bit more and onto the highest point of your tin for
9:40me that's right here
9:46right there so I'm going to take 6 plus x mac and whenever you want super ultra
9:51glow super high do we finish fix plus and I'm quickly going in with a
9:59stippling brush and stipple this out
10:04so you get an even do we finish and then to finish of this look all you need to
10:08do is your lips
10:10so I'm going to completely blank on my lips because her lips were nude
10:14so I'm taking the hourglass lipstick in some nude number one because i wanted to
10:18use myth by Mac but i found that to be too dead in the face so I want a little
10:23bit more and miss her and then 4a plus i'm using this
10:31illamasqua sheer lip gloss in exquisite
10:37I may want to take a little bit more and especially focusing on the highest point
10:41of your Cupid's bow to really reflect that light
10:55and that guy's concludes my JLo inspired makeup tutorial for her new music video

2:58and i'm using my Sigma f80 six and i'm going to set my under eye area using
3:08emphasize shaping partner by Mac all right now I'm going to do browse off

3:22will be doing my eyebrows using the Anasazi Beverly Hills brow ways and ash
3:28blonde and also the dipbrow pomade in taupe so i'll be doing my eyebrows for
3:34eyes are going to start of by priming them of course and i'm using my soft
3:38ochre Paint Pot by Mac my first eyeshadow is going to come from the
3:46Urban Decay Naked 3 palette and it's going to be the color
3:50nooner reason why i chose the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette is because it's
3:55the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette i am taking nooner and i'm going to apply it
3:59straight to the crease and first mainly focusing on this outer edge here but
4:09then once most product is on
4:11I work my way to the inner corners of my crease for the let him taking my own
4:19estas de Beverly Hills
4:20tamannah pellet and going in the color china rose and I'm applying this to the
4:26inner half of my lids and oh can you look at this
4:32color i am now going in that same palette and then taking song griha and
4:37this is going on the outer half of the lid meeting up to the crease and then
4:44I'm actually taking a blending brush with sangria and applying this to the
4:50crease to give it a little bit of that warmer color that song right has its a
4:57blended in nicer then still using the term on appellate and going in chocolate
5:02and for this look I want a fairly colorful lid and really smoky liner and
5:07underneath portion so this is going from inner to outer corner of the lower lash
5:12line and then to blend this out and give it a nice smoky feeling going back into
5:20sangria and i'm using this to soften and blend out chocolate on the lower lash
5:29line and then now it's time for the liner i'm taking my Sigma wicked
5:36standout eyes gel eyeliner to start off with
5:40and i'm going to start off with a line right here determining where I want my
5:45angle to go to from my line
5:54and then switching over to the cabin D tattoo liner in trooper this product has
6:00been talked about so so much
6:02first let's just fill in that sort of triangle we create it ok then for the
6:08inner corner for this little thing right here
6:11you want to look down and sort of pull the top line of your inner corner down
6:18from that line you go back to the the lower lash line portion and then you
6:24have a little trying to fill it in and fill up and then all we want to do is
6:37connect this corner to that line right there
6:49on the waterline am using the hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel liner in
6:54obsidian and this is one of the products that I wish is going to create some
6:59serious buzz in the community
7:04I'm really a lover of putting something right underneath the pupil of the eye
7:09so for this I'm going to use my born pretty store nail art wheel thingy majig
7:14right here and there are some seriously small gold studs in there and i'm just
7:19going to pop them right on the skin on the eye on everything
7:32ok so there's that now to completely finish off the eyes I need some falsies
7:36i'll be using my shen x 0
7:38soul mates lashes alright so for takes the first gonna sculpt and contour the
7:45face and i'm using my understanding of Beverly Hills contour kit for this
7:49everyone also and their mamas grandma's grandpa's everyone is using the Contras
7:57kid on YouTube to either highlights or contours
8:00so I figured that is what i'll be using and i'm going to take a little bit of
8:03this color right here because it's the coolest out of the three and i
8:07definitely need that with my pal skin tone so I'm just going to start carving
8:15the cheeks out

1:47crease so that they meet and i'm also focusing it on the outer third
1:53so you leave a nice clean gap in the middle you can even focus it in the
2:00crease a little bit more to do with some definition we just want to keep that
2:05middle part bear with a fluffy brush
2:08go ahead and blend that out and soften the edges really importante

2:48and then I'm going into my Anasazi Beverly Hills taman address your face
2:53palette and it has a color called a blush which is the perfect color to
2:57highlight that liquid gold pencil even more so with the same brush I'm taking
3:02blush and going over top slightly so we can blend the edges a little bit better
3:09with the brown then for the lower lash line them again picking up a warm taupe

0:57then please stay tuned
0:59so to start this look off i'm taking a new favorite this is my mac care blend
1:04of essential oils in grapefruit and chamomile
1:07so I'm just going to take about four drops of that and apply that to my face
1:14it's very early right now and I feel like with kidneys a little bit of glow
1:18to it because I love dead i'm going to take the becca shimmering skin Perfector
1:21e in opal and just take one pump of that and then also apply that to the face for
1:30my foundation today I'm going to take l'oreal true match in c1 and then I'm
1:34bluffing this in using my Sigma f80 brush and give yourself a flawless days
1:42for concealer going to go with max pro longwear in NC 15 go crazy on this bish
1:51and then as always buffing this in using my Sigma f80 60 poke yourself now going
2:01to set this all using a little bit of powder this is next studio fix powder in
2:06NW 10 and then i'm going to do browse and one
2:10I off camera and then we'll be back first thing I'm doing is applying a base
2:14to my eyelids to prevent that I should from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft
2:18ochre paint up with this first going to highlight my eye using my shaping powder
2:22by Mac in emphasize and no just
2:25highlighting my brow bone and inner corners but this now for the lid I'm
2:36going into my too faced chocolate bar and I'm taking the really soft pinky
2:40color and was a really big soft fluffy brush you just want to place that onto
2:45the lid to get a soft wash of the color and i love this touch of pink in the
2:52look because the kind of changes the entire feel of it it makes it more
2:56interesting
2:57I am taking a little bit of kid eyeshadow by mac and I'm just a softly
3:02defining my crease with this just because I don't really have deep set
3:07eyes and a doing have that illusion and I noticed that big E's eyes aren't the
3:13biggest of eyes either
3:15so her makeup artist that's this trick as well
3:20therefore the lower lash line and going to take copperplate by mac and mix it
3:24with a little bit of that kid eyeshadow and just to give the lower lash line a
3:28little bit more definition
3:31I'm packing copper plate on on the outer corner here of my lower lash line and
3:36then continuing with kid only i'm going to drag it further in
3:42so you have a dark concentration of copper plate on the outer part and kid
3:49on the inner part on my waterline of popping a bit of jumbo pencil by NYX in
3:54milk and then just on the inner corner only i'm packing on a little bit more of
3:59that emphasize to really open up my eyes for the winged liner and taking NYC
4:06liquid liner in black and we're just going for a really soft ring to line
4:12scoop over it just has a regular same old line as always but I sup right in
4:19the middle of my lid and that will keep the inner part of the ice clean and soft
4:23and natural but you still have that wing going on for that starting line you kind
4:28of want to aim for the end of your eyebrow
4:35and then I like to go in with a black net eyeshadow and really clean up that
4:44edge and with this you can also really make it really nice soft flick at the
4:59end
5:01now i'm going to do to finish off the look is apply a little bit of mascara
5:04this is my makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra black and for lashes I'm gonna
5:08go with the XO beauty
5:11sea lions and when you cut the felines in half
5:14you have the beginning . that flares out to that really flared out end and you
5:19want to cut it in the middle and then you have this really nice flared up
5:24short
5:25you know natural lash you're just going to pop that on the outer part of your
5:29eye and then you have this really nice to look for cheeks there wasn't a whole
5:33lot going on other than a really nice a soft sculpting and soft blush and soft
5:39glow
5:40so that's what we're going for today I first going to contour style pleasing my
5:44LS guy shadow in heroin there for blush I'm using a little bit of launch away by
5:55mac and this is just a beautiful soft peachy color and that is exactly what
6:00you want to go for soft and peachy and then for my glow today I'm again taking
6:07my Ben Nye lumiere looks powder in ice
6:10just because this gives the most stunning a glow of life for lips you
6:20want to go for a classic red and further mixing tool it mixes by mac i'm using
6:25crimson and read and read because it is a little bit more orange based in a
6:30little bit more bright and crimson for that nice deepness

0:24black widow inspired makeup tutorial question was am I going to do Iggy
0:29Azalea or am I gonna do Rita Ora and up until like two o'clock this afternoon
0:33I could not make my decision but time was taking and I needed to film
0:37something and I couldn't really decide which one to go for it so I was like why
0:42not do or rainbow lie
0:44yeah without any further ado if you want to know how to get these rainbow eyes
0:48then please stay tuned
0:50ok so the first thing I'm doing is applying a base to my eyelids to prevent
0:54the eye shadows from creasing and to make the colors pop a lot more than they
1:00normally would and for this I'm using Mac's soft ochre Paint Pot then to give
1:05my crease some definition I'm taking max sculpting powder in taupe and I just
1:10take a little bit of that and start applying it to my crease and with really
1:14soft movements you want to go from outer to inner corner and then blend up really
1:21softly now i'm taking the max shaping powder in emphasize and with emphasize
1:27i'm highlighting my brow bone and blending down that taupe color that we
1:32applied previously and this way it will get an even nicer blend and also I like
1:37to load this up on the inner corners and blend up right here for the lid of
1:43taking that mac emphasize partner again and mixing it with makeup geeks
1:47eyeshadow in shimma shimma and i'm applying this combo to my lid area a
1:54nice a light neutral shimmery color to make the bright colors stand out even
2:01more
2:02i'm going to start off by taking savage from the Urban Decay electric palette
2:06and I'm applying this color to be very inner corner of my eye
2:12this is going to be my beginning . of the eyeliner and you can make this as a
2:17thick and dramatic as you want i'm going to go quite far with it because I love
2:23that
2:23next up is
2:24sugar pills of flame points i shadow you want to place a flame . right in the
2:30middle of the line and blending the edges with savage and you just want to
2:39keep reapplying the colors until you get the desired intensity and color payoff
2:44and then at the end i like to wet my brush with a little bit of water and
2:50trays the top to get a nice clean edge
2:54next in line a little bit of red this is a left plus by sugarpill and you guessed
3:00it
3:01this is going right next to flame . and again you want to blend the edges in
3:07with the previous color and just drag that to the outer corner of your lashes
3:12your lash line for the wing i'm using a purple this is sugar pills poison plum
3:17and you want to make your wing with this and from the outer . of your winged
3:21dragon back to the red then you guessed it you want to fill that in and
3:32eventually blend the edges with the red
3:36so taking a bit of that red and reapplying it in between that orange and
3:42the purple to give a really nice gradient know what you can do is throw a
3:47little bit of mascara and false lashes on this look in your dawn color today
3:51and have a really nice rainbow eyeliner I'm however going to take it all the way
3:56so i'm going to take the cooler shades of the rainbow and apply those to the
4:01bottom part of my eyes
4:03so for the blue which is going on the outer part of my lower lash line from i
4:08educate electric palette i'm going to take a chaos and gonzo and i'm just
4:12applying them really close to the roots of a lower lashes
4:16connecting to that purple for the green portion I'm taking sugar pills and
4:22midori and Urban Decay electric thrash and this is going on to the middle of my
4:30lower lash line and i'm going to drag it down quite far because i want to give
4:35the lower portion of the eye
4:37I was really nice grungy sunken-in feel and it kind of blends in better with the
4:43sort of i jewelry that i'm going to apply later on then to open up the inner
4:47corners a bit more
4:49I am dragging down my new inner corner so i'm going to create this new inner
4:53corner illusion by just dragging a line a little bit further away from the
4:58actual inner corner and then to open that I up and use my glass color of the
5:10rainbow which is yellow
5:11I'm going in butter cupcake by sugarpill and I like to really load that up on the
5:17new inner corner that we created you just want to feel that line of and
5:23packet on on the inner corner area right here and bam your rainbow is the whole
5:30the way I am quickly highlighting my inner corners using that emphasize
5:34powder by Mac then run a little bit of milk jumbo pencil by nicks on the
5:42waterline and now i'm going to take this super gorgeous mill decoration sort of
5:47it's not a sticker it's sort of like a little you know a little piece of paper
5:53and I thought because this has a really nice triangular shape to it why not
5:57place it on the middle of my lower lash line and that gives us really nice sort
6:01of you know
6:03golden touch to the look I'm going to grab a little bit of glue place a little
6:07. and you know put this over top and then we have this really nice

2:39mac studio fix powder foundation powder and number and the w 18 and I'm gonna do
2:46browse than 1i off-camera and then we'll be back
2:49the first thing I'm doing is applying a base two eyelets to prevent that shadow
2:53from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint pop for this now going in
2:59the Sigma brilliant and spellbinding eyeshadow palette and I'm taking the
3:03color balmy and with a big blending brush i'm applying this to the crease
3:08and then blending up and to the sides you want this to be very smoky and
3:15blended out and hazy just sexy really from that same brilliant and
3:21spellbinding sigma IV the palette i'm taking radiant and i'm applying radiant
3:27to the inner part of my crease very lightly and white brush off and diffuse
3:33the edges and blended in with ball we and i love that later on we're going to
3:39have that really serve dark Toby brown lip and then that warmth on the eyes
3:45I love that i'm going to highlight using the shaping powder by Mac called
3:50emphasize and that was just going on my brow loan and with this you can really
3:57blend out radiant as well and i also like to load it up on this inner corner
4:04here i'm taking a bit of makeup geek mocha eyeshadow and first
4:11applying this right near the roots of my lower lashes about half way in from
4:20there I'm going to go back into the crease from that lower lash line up to
4:28the crease so you can nicked it and then slightly start blowing it to the sides
4:34and then still working with mocha I'm building this up on the very outer edge
4:45of my I really build definition there as the base for my lady I'm taking this
4:54makeup revolution awesome metals eyeshadow in magnificent copper and this
4:59is a really nice creamy products i'm just going to take it with my finger and
5:03dab it onto the lid it's very very pretty and sparkly and intense but i
5:10just want that sparkle for my base so not as much the color more so that
5:16sparkle because that is brilliant overtop of Devon going back into the
5:22stigma brilliant spell lighting palette and I'm taking number 10 and I'm simply
5:27applying this over top of that awesome metal eyeshadow by makeup revolution and
5:35you still get that amazing Sparkle from that from the base but you slightly ship
5:41the color a more topi way
5:45ok now for the very inner corner your first one to make a new sort of tear
5:49duct area so you want to take a black liquid liner and then draw a tiny tiny
5:55mythical little line on the very inner corner and you drag it out of it so you
6:00create this elongated in the corner for this i'm taking my NYC eyeliner liquid
6:05liquid eyeliner in black you know I got this because of crispy and this is going
6:09to be so balls hard to do on camera so i'm probably going to do it off camera
6:14and then mimic the movement
6:16ok so i did it how you do it you want to tilt your head down create this sort of
6:203rd kin and then you want to make a
6:23little tiny line coming straight out of your tear ducts from that point there
6:29you go back into the eye and then fill that little gap up now going back in
6:35sumo cup i'm going to follow that new sort of direction that my new inner
6:40corner when two and then in between this we're going to use a sparkle because
6:50what sparkles really reflects light and that really gives you that feeling of a
6:56new sort of inner corner creation so to make with sparkle stick i'm going to
7:00take my make up forever aqua liner in number 19 and first laid down as a based
7:08in between the two new lines it's basically your new in a corner now
7:15now I like to go in my makeup studio dual effects and shine and go right over
7:21top of what I'm going to pop a little bit of white liner this is milk jumbo
7:33pencil by nicks and I just tracing this on my waterline are away from the black
7:38so where the black stops right there you want to go with the white and this will
7:41really open up the eyes okay now with that same NYC liquid liner going to
7:45create a nice dramatic winged eyeliner on top
7:58now all you want to do is finish is off with a little bit of mascara I'm using

0:12hey guys today no smokey eyes and new lips no it's time to go back into fall
0:18it's time to do a inspired makeup tutorial on an artist that has been
0:23loving lately and she recently came out with a song called break the rules and
0:28for me
0:29charli XCX is break the rules is the song of the year . i love the music
0:36video i love charli XCX i I just I love everything about her salad so edgy and
0:42cool and her makeup was awesome and break the rules so I decided to do a
0:47charli XCX inspired makeup tutorial especially particularly inspired by
0:53break the rules
0:54so if you want to know how to get this look right here then please stay tuned
0:58all right the first thing we're going to do is pry my face to give it a nice base
1:01to work with and I'm using my hourglass mineral veil primer for this
1:06I have heard so many amazing things about this product and that this is
1:11actually my first time trying it
1:13I already can tell it it's very dry and by no means feels very hydrating and
1:19nourishing but it is super soft and velvety
1:23hmm I obviously need to try it a little bit more for foundation today I'm going
1:27to go with a BB cream actually and this is a new favorite this is by Garnier and
1:32this is the pure active BB cream
1:34I'm really really liking this 11 it's affordable to the coverage is absolutely
1:40amazing and let me just put it on you will see
1:43okay at first just gonna put this on my face wherever I want it and I'm not
1:51doing this in with a Sigma f80 brush and I can already tell that the smell of
1:56this is absolutely amazing it has that really iconic pure active cucumber smell
2:04it has a lovely matte texture which is exactly what you want because charli XCX
2:10loves her mad face she does highlight was a glowy product but the overall feel
2:16of her face is really nice and Matt and what I also really like about this BB
2:20cream is that it actually has coverage
2:23I mean this is a you
2:25pn BB cream and normally European BB creams are more like attentive
2:29moisturizer
2:30you can't really get much out of them but this one actually has coverage and
2:35it looks nice and it just it just looks nice on the skin i really really like it
2:41and with that comes is that it also lasts for just something i don't find a
2:47lot of BB Creams do normally they just fade after an hour for this just stays
2:52on the entire day i'm just a huge fan of this it's affordable it stays on long
2:57it looks beautiful the structure is absolutely beautiful it makes you look
3:01met and perfected and I'm just a huge fan of this BB cream
3:07I mean what is going on with me I used to hate BB creams and now i love them
3:10for concealer gonna go with my Mac NC 15 pro longwear concealer and i'm going to
3:15make it a little bit more light to highlight my face using this kryolan
3:19Creole on ID 0a dermablend color
3:34and I'm going to about this in using my Sigma f-86 brush and reason why I went
3:40so like with my concealer is because Charlie has an amazing light complexion
3:47and I just wanted to you know bring up my features a little bit more and also
3:52by mixing that pro longwear with that Creole on a derma blend color the
3:57kreelan dermablend color has a really nice matte coverage so again you will
4:03have their really nice porcelain Matt feel I'm now going to set this always
4:07innovating now naturalist finish part number 20 Claire and also do my brows
4:12off camera which is going to make a little bit more dark because Charlie has
4:16really nice intense and dark brows as well so i'm going to do that all off
4:20camera and then it will be back
4:22so first i'll be applying a base to my eyelids to prevent that I should from
4:26creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this then to define my
4:32crease a little bit i'm taking a mac sculpting powder called sculpt and with
4:38this one lightly bringing definition into my crease to make the eyes appear a
4:45little bit more deep set and larger there was another mac pro sculpting
4:50powder called emphasize I am highlighting my brow bone and inner
4:55corners right here now taking a make up for ever aqua cream in number two and
5:04i'm applying this all over the lid area meeting up into the crease and this is a
5:10beautiful peuterey silver color just exactly what you want to go for then
5:16once you have that base down with a more fluffy brush I'm going to diffuse the
5:22edges up and out so it gets a really nice transition to make that color catch
5:30the light even more i'm taking results from the Urban Decay electric palette
5:34and unlikely packing that on on the middle of my eyelid and diffusing the
5:41edges out to the sides and this way your lid get a really nice
5:46glowing
5:47fact so the brightest part is in the center right here and then you defuse it
5:52out to that peuterey color from make up forever and then just really catches the
5:58light beautifully for the eye liner part i'm taking a matte black eyeshadow and
6:03the first making a line on where I want my wing to go to
6:09now brush some of that black really closely to the roots of your lashes and
6:19then drag it from that point to the lashes fill in and then with another
6:31rush you really want to diffuse the edges of that line you don't want it to
6:35be a really stark and intense eyeliner you just wanted to be a haze of an
6:42eyeliner so go ahead and blend those edges out and then the same black color
6:49is applied to the roots of the lower lashes and then at the outer part here
6:53you want to connected to the liner on top and then just kind of buff in that
7:00black color on the lower lash line now for the inner corners and mixing a bit
7:05of that max sculpting powder in emphasize with makeup geek eyeshadow in
7:09bling packing that on on the very inner corners here to open up the eyes and
7:15then you kind of want to look down and brush it right here now with my
7:21hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel liner in obsidian and then align my
7:26waterline and now it's time for mascara i'm just going to use my makeup studio
7:33waterproof 3d in extra black and on top a little bit of the halika halika magic
7:39pole mascara for the cheeks are going to do a little bit of contouring using my
7:43NYX blush in taupe and a little bit of the mac sculpting powder in sculpt and
7:49with those i'm just going to carve out my cheeks a little bit more to give my
7:53face a bit more definition
7:56for blush of me is one of my favorite colors by Mac this is Melba and just
8:03dust this from the contour up to the cheeks
8:08so you start at your contour and then go on to the cheeks to highlight i'm going
8:13to use another favorite product of mine
8:15this is max pigment in vanilla and this is just it lightly on the tops of my
8:21cheekbones and then blending the edges out for Charlie's iconic met deep red
8:29lips i'm going to use a product mixture of two live mixes by Mac called crimson
8:34and black and you just want to use the tiniest amount of the black to deepen
8:40the crimson color
9:04and that guy's concludes my charli XCX break the rules inspired makeup tutorial

1:02the nicki minaj anaconda look and um yeah that a further ado if you wanna
1:07know how do you get the Anaconda look at them please stay tuned for priming today
1:12I'm going to go with one of my favorite combos that is my Mac prep and prime
1:16natural radiance in radiant yellow mixed with a little bit of back a shimmering
1:21skin Perfector in opal
1:23so these three together are going right on my face and you definitely want to
1:27add in some sort of shimmer glow product to the face because Nikki looked super
1:34super glowing and radiant and sexy delicious
1:39so you definitely want to add that glow to your face then now it's time for
1:45foundation and I wanted to try something you because this just came in the mail
1:50this is by Rimmel London this is the lasting finish 25-hour spf20 skin
1:57perfecting full coverage foundation
2:00this is number two hundred in the soft beige and because this is way too warm
2:04for my face and this is their lightest shade going to mix it with Max face and
2:08body in white to lighten this down and then I'm just going to put some of that
2:13mixture
2:14onto my face
2:18taking my flat kabuki brush by Sigma the s80 i'm just going to work this in and
2:25oh oh oh oh
2:34then as usual for concealer i'm going to go with my mac pro longwear this is the
2:41shit
2:41and because joycie benelli which is also the makeup artists for the Kardashians a
2:45lot of times did nicki minaj's makeup
2:49i believe so because she's done Nikki's make up a lot of times recently some
2:53kind of figured that she did it
2:55she's known for the triangle highlighting that I was like I'm let's
2:59do that today because I normally don't really do that and i kind of want to
3:07today
3:08so BAM hashtag what does natural mean
3:12hashtag back to school makeup also let's do a little bit of knows highlighting
3:19here because that's what happened on Nicki space and I liked it
3:29ok now i'm going to but that in using my f-86 bass Sigma because i love it
3:38i recently got this comment from a guy on my channel and he was like do you
3:46sleep at night for deceiving men like this by putting on all that makeup and I
3:54just flat-out left for 10 minutes on to get another one that's what you take her
3:59swimming on the first date
4:01it's a good one - really good one
4:04I'll give you ten for that then I'm just going to set my under eye area with my
4:09favorite powder
4:11this one is by chanel and it's the natural is finished in number 20
4:17Claire and I'm going to go ahead and do my brows and one I off camera and then
4:22it will be back
4:23ok the first thing i'll be doing
4:25is applying a base to my eyelids do you prevent this entire creation from
4:28creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot in heaven soft ochre fits the
4:35first I shall going to be working with his kid by neck
4:39I'm just taking that color and placing it in my crease as my transition shade
4:45so this is to blend out that crease color easier later on and then at the
4:53side here you kind of want to swoop it out to give it a nice winged shape and
5:00then go back in and diffuse the edges then i'm going in with Max mystery
5:06eyeshadow and really lightly
5:09i'm going to start defining that crease even more and quite precise as well so
5:18you want to add that mystery in kind of a more precise and concentrated manner
5:26and then also when you get to that side here you want to swoop it out to give
5:30that nice wing
5:34not too much you'll go too far with it and I'm really lightly to fuse the edges
5:40but you really want to have that you know concentration with mystery in the
5:47crease and they can always go back in with a little bit of kid and make the
5:54blend between those two even softer and nicer
5:59just make it a really nice concentrated and diffused crease then for a villain
6:06and going with this amazing new Sigma pigment
6:09this is called Lou shimmer in midsummer and i'm picking some of that up with my
6:14finger and padding it onto the lid area meeting up with the dark brown color in
6:21decrease and you want it from inner corner to outer corner and I just oh my
6:28god I love this color so damn much
6:31then going in with another stigma Lucia more pigment
6:34this is called a gilded and this one is going right in
6:37middle again up to the crease and then blend the edges to the sides and we're
6:45doing this because nikki had this stunning a glowing gold lid and it just
6:55the gold looked like it was glowing and the only technique you have for that to
7:01make something glow is by darkening the outer edges and you know glowing and
7:06making lighter of the center
7:10so those what I'm doing with these pigments for the eyeliner I first really
7:14want to have that strong line where I want my eyeliner to go to you
7:18so for that i'm taking this Real Techniques silicone liner brush and a
7:22little bit of my Sigma gel eyeliner and wicked and what this
7:28I can really determine where I want the start line of my winged liner to go to
7:34and also from there you can drag it back on toward the lashes and now we move
7:44over to my country's liquid liner in dating joe black to do the rest of the
7:48eye line of work
7:58I'm now popping a little bit of concealer on the inner portion of my
8:04eyes to really highlight it and make it clean and crisp and an over top of that
8:11i'm applying a little bit of the bombs and mary lou manizer to finish off the
8:18eyes it's time for mascara and for that I'll be using my waterproof 3d extra
8:23black mascara by making studio combined with a little bit of the halika halika
8:28magic pole mascara and for lashes the mac 36 for the cheeks and nikki had this
8:34amazing warm bronzy glow going on her and I just absolutely love that it's so
8:40sultry and glowing and glam and just beautiful
8:44so I'm gonna go with a mixture of products to get there to get to that
8:48destination
8:50i first go to carve out my cheeks a little bit with my illamasqua eyeshadow
8:54in heroin
9:06then to further warm up my face going to go with a bronzer
9:09this is one of my favorites this is refined golden by Mac I'm just going to
9:14go on my forehead and kinda follow the entire hairline area so we leave like a
9:22nice little spot of brightness in the middle
9:25drag queens call that the battery mode and then also with that I'm going to hit
9:30the hype points of my cheekbones and blend that contour out a little bit more
9:38okay then just start working on the beautiful glow I'm first going to add
9:43some glow with warmth
9:45this is stereo rose and mineralized skin finish my mac and it's really warm and
9:50intense and it actually distribute a little bit of color and this is actually
9:55amazing for medium to dark skinned people girls boys
9:59everyone and switch it on my cheeks so sort of from that entire bronzer thing
10:06we did this comes out on the cheeks and just it gives it a really nice warmth
10:15but because it's a mineralized skin finish it also gives ma zing shine like
10:23it makes you look like plastic or highlight I'm gonna go with becca
10:26shimmering skin Perfector pressed in moonstone because it's nice light and
10:32golden
10:32so it's going to give you that exact same perfect law as Nikki head feel like
10:38I keep talking about myself
10:39ok you take a little bit on a brush place it on the highest points of your
10:44cheeks which is about right on the sides of your eyes and you want to build it up
10:50a little so I'm going to take more and build it up then wipe my brush off and
10:56I'm going to blend the edges out so the main impact of highlight is going to be
11:03here because you pack it on here and then you blend it out
11:08softly and then you're left wait let me get a little bit more of the blush in
11:12and then you're left with this high shine glow which is
11:19exactly what he was wearing
11:22and then lastly what I'm going to do is to really get myself that glow
11:26Julie glow I'm gonna go with my NYX juhi finish a long-lasting setting spray for
11:31sure
11:32good okay and then just spritz your lips you want to go very glossy and nude with
11:42a punch of pink
11:44so for that i'm first going to take my NYX lip pencil in natural with him
11:50everything but today for lips i'm using Mac's lipstick in angel and then for
12:07gloves are going to go with my NYX butter gloss in Maple blondie

0:08hey guys today I'm doing a tutorial and in-depth tutorial on a fresh and easy
0:19back to school makeup look at this is definitely for the people who love
0:24wearing makeup to school personally I i was 14 when i started my youtube channel
0:29on here and I was 14 so I was still in school and i basically around the time i
0:35became 15 I started to obsess with make up more and more so i actually put my
0:42alarm like a half hour earlier to actually play with makeup in the morning
0:46at school I kind of was the girl that had different eye shadows on every
0:50single day and I i saw every day as an experimental day for eyeshadows I see
0:56that today I'm going to do a fresh and easy in-depth back to school makeup look
1:00I'm keeping it
1:02more on the wearable site it's definitely it's i'm wearing makeup
1:06you can tell that i'm wearing makeup this is not a no-makeup makeup look but
1:10i still try to keep it really useful & fresh and glowy and radiant and I I
1:16personally really really like this look if you want to know how to get this
1:19fresh and easy in-depth back to school look there please keep watching
1:24ok the first thing we're going to be doing for the face is priming it I wish
1:28I would have known back in the day what priming was I i did play a lot with
1:34makeup when I was younger and when I was in high school but i never knew what
1:38priming for a face
1:40good deal let's say you have a more dry skin you can prime it by giving it more
1:45moisture and therefore the foundation will look better on top of it
1:50if you have more of an oily skin type you can prime it which fights back the
1:56oils and keeps it at bay for the entire day and your makeup last longer
2:01my skin today is a little bit of a battlefield and it also feels very
2:06drying today so I need something that locks in the moisture that keeps the
2:10moisture in the entire day
2:13plus it has to make the makeup that I put on top last all day long
2:17look beautiful what I find works best for that is my Mac prep and prime
2:21natural radiance in radiant yellow they also have a pink one but I just like
2:25yellow
2:25I'm just going to take a few pumps of that and apply that to my entire face
2:32and just gently rub it in
2:35if you have an oily skin type you might want to add a little bit of makeup
2:39setting spray right now I'm not going to because i find that these can be a bit
2:43trying for information today
2:45i also want to really encourage you guys to not go too far with it we all know
2:51the typical girls you know the popular girls with like pancake faces black kohl
2:57eyeliner inside their eyes and it's six meters below it
3:01spider lashes and awful eyebrows so I really want to urge you guys to not go
3:07too far with your base of course you can pack it up a little bit more if you have
3:12a little bit more of a problem skin but still keep it thin wearable and
3:17traceless is today going to use a BB cream and this is the super plus BB
3:23cream
3:24triple function by skin79 is just the orange be between from skin79 and I'm
3:30going to take it and a . it on my face
3:35now it's safer to first . some of the product onto your face and then buff it
3:44in and then look at what else you need
3:47it's safer to do that instead of you know gunking up the products on your
3:53face and then at the end being like our shit that's way too much
3:57you can definitely apply this with your fingers it saves you time it saves you
4:02money
4:02it's not my preferred technique because i just don't really like using my
4:07fingers for foundation the base
4:09I'm so i'm going to go with a brush this is by Sigma this T flat kabuki f80 brush
4:14and with that I'll go to buff that BB cream in
4:22once that's buffed in its time for concealer
4:26so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a concealer that lasts so long
4:31plus it just gives me an amazing coverage i'm talking about the mac pro
4:35longwear in NC 15 but if you do not have that you can also go for the next HD
4:40photogenic concealer which I really really love this fall and they come in a
4:44bunch of colors but i'm just going to go for the mac one today and you want to
4:48place it underneath your eyes and also in this inner corner right here and i
4:53like to swim a bit up to the the sides of my eyes here
4:58you don't have to do that at all but you can
5:03the option is there and i'll go it's about that in with yet another brush and
5:07that is a sick my f-86 tapered kabuki brush and you just want to start tapping
5:13it in there and defuse that concealer out
5:18ok now what I like to do is set this to make it last all day long so I'm just
5:22going to take a little bit of my favorite powder and i'm going to take a
5:26little tiny teeny brush and I'm just going to lightly set that concealer
5:32underneath my eye and they want to do now is let that foundation rest and
5:37really the sink into my face
5:39so and then do browse and then come back and finish it all off with powder that
5:44way
5:45the front of you can really settle and think into the skin and do its job and
5:50then you can powder it and make it last all day long so I'm going to do browse
5:54now and i'm just going to use my usual products of the brow is by anastasia and
5:58a little bit of dip brow pomade in tok so I'm going to make a mixture of that
6:03and do my brows
6:04I'm going to do that off-camera i have a full tutorial on that if you want to
6:08know how i do them and then we'll be back here one of the most important
6:13things you want to do when it comes to your eyes
6:15it's priming them it's the same as the skin if you want something to last you
6:20want to prime it
6:21there are a bunch of primers to choose from but my favorite is by mac and it's
6:25a pain pot and this is called soft ochre and I like applying this just by taking
6:31my finger
6:32and then just start tapping it onto the lid and wipe any axes off and start
6:38buffing all that you have on your lid in and it's really important to not forget
6:44the bottom part of your eyes ever eyes when I want to be doing is defining them
6:52but not going too far and still having a little bit of glamour because the
6:56glamour is all it lately so we need some lamb up in here and because my eyes are
7:01somewhat smaller and I don't have a lot of crease
7:04I really want some definition in my crease I'll be taking kid
7:08eyeshadow by mac and i'll be applying that softly to my crease so just with a
7:13big blending brush to find your crease just a tad bit more then i take
7:23undercover from the lorac unzipped palette and with that I just love to
7:29highlight i highlight my brow bone with this
7:33so blending it with that kit collar and i also love opening up the inner portion
7:38of my eye
7:40so the inner corners it's just this color works perfectly for that because
7:45it just opens up your eyes and makes you look super super healthy and wide awake
7:49and you know
7:51ready to take them books
7:54now you could stop here because you have that definition in your crease and you
7:58have highlighted so you look a little bit more wide awake but i want to add a
8:02little bit of glam and more definition so i'll be taking a wet and wild trio
8:08and this is called a walking on eggshells and i love these colors right
8:12here so i'm going to make it make sure between the brow bone color and the
8:17eyelid color and just with my finger
8:20i'm going to apply those to my lid meeting up with the crease color that
8:27kid color and i love these colors on the lid because they're still very light
8:32reflective and glam but they're not too much and not too overpowering meaning
8:38that they're perfect for school because you can still look glam without going
8:43too little or too much
8:44for the bottom lash I'm going to take that crease color and I'm just placing
8:49this really closely to the roots of my lower lashes and slightly work my way in
8:56and then for the tiniest bit of a wing / more definition and flirt
9:02I'm going to take that same color and from that lower lashline drag it out so
9:09you have a nice little wing going on and drag it back in to create a wing and
9:16then you just want to create a nice haze around the edges to smoke it in and make
9:24it less harsh and i really like doing this because it gives you the illusion
9:28of a nice wing but it's still very soft wearable and totally okay for school
9:37and lastly you want to apply mascara to really make your I speak and you want to
9:41go top and bottom just to make it look really flirty and nice and young and
9:46fresh
9:47the mascara so i'll be using our makeup studio what a proof 3d an extra black
9:51and i'm also applying a bit of this korean brand mascara this is by holy ,
9:55holy cow i believe and it's the magic pole mascara so i'm going to apply that
10:01to my lashes top and bottom and then it will be back
10:04ok so far cheeks i think the most important thing to remind yourself of is
10:08that less is more when it comes to cheeks and high school
10:13I personally did a little bit of contouring already because my face just
10:17needs contouring I'm and I'm still going to use a little bit of bronzer bronzer
10:21is always a good option it makes you look a warm and healthy and radiant
10:27so a little bit of bronzer is never a bad idea
10:30so I'm going to go with my illamasqua i disobey and i'm just going to focus it
10:34on my forehead tops of my cheekbones and then just kind of make a 3 out of it
10:44so you start at your forehead go to the top of your cheek chin jawline
10:50sorry ok for blush i want to go for something radiant and
10:53happy and healthy and I'm going to go for my mineral eyes blush by Mac called
10:58DNT for that out and put it on the apples of your cheeks and then blending
11:04back for me personally highlighting is a must because I feel like when you go
11:10little on the eyes and you go little on the lips later on and you go little on
11:14the skin
11:15you definitely do want to have their radiant glow and I just think that the
11:19less makeup you wear and the more glow you have the the prettier gets so i'm
11:24going to highlight using my Mac mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle
11:27and the tiniest bit of becca shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone and you want
11:32to focus this on the highest points of your cheekbones right at the side of
11:37your eyes and they would I like to do is take a more concentrated brush and smile
11:43and you kind of see this light reflective thing popping up
11:48you kind of want to highlight there as well underneath your eyes on to the
11:54cheeks because that just makes you look glowy
11:58you have no idea for lips you want to go with something that you can easily throw
12:03in your bag and touch up throughout the day and i'm going to go with my NYX
12:07jumbo eye pencil in 7 17 and it's called Irish coffee and it's just a beautiful
12:14peachy pink color
12:16it's nude but it has a punch of color and it's a little bit of glossy and it's
12:20it just it where it's nicely and it just looks really good on the lips so this
12:25slap it on
12:33and that guy's concludes this in-depth easy back to school fresh makeup

0:21entire video i absolutely adore the look that she has on when she's like swinging
0:26on that flower swing it's just so glamorous and so girly and beautiful but
0:33I thought for today to punch it up a bit and go for that really beautiful blue
0:37smoky cut crease look that she was wearing now it was i filmed this video
0:42yesterday as well and a kind of field all at once it was so hard for me to
0:46exactly pinpoint what parents was wearing until I found the Instagram page
0:51of the makeup artists that this look on Paris and I could actually see real-life
0:55shots and the color in her crease was actually a lot darker and more intense
1:00so then I immediately knew what to do with this entire look
1:03yeah if you want to know how to get this paris hilton come alive inspired look
1:08then please keep watching
1:10so the first thing i'll be doing is a pioneer base / primer to of course give

1:22of glow
1:23I'm gonna go with my becca shimmering skin Perfector in opal and just going to
1:27apply the two with my fingers then because i'm having a little bit of a dry
1:34skin day I'm gonna go for a more wet foundation that hasn't got a lot of
1:38powder in it i'll be using my Mac face and body foundation in c1 for this and
1:43to give it a little bit more coverage i'm mixing in a little bit of my mac

5:50inner corner
5:51the more precise and thing you want your line to be so this way it gives a really
5:56nice elongated cat eye effect and that is exactly what Arianna was wearing as
6:01well
6:18ok and now it's time to do one of her I jewels that she had right here
6:24now I know that Ariana was having a really nice silver crystal coloured
6:29sequined there
6:31I don't have that believe it or not i do not own one that size
6:35so i'm going to change it up a little bit i really like gold
6:39so I popped a gold a shot right there a circle study around adopt a gold .
6:47Todd and I got it from this wheel right here and i will put a link down below on
6:51where you can get this and the gold dud to stud is right here and i'll be
6:57applying that as my side I jewelry is very easy to apply just apply some glue
7:02or you want it and then you went a q-tip and then really easily you can just pick
7:08one up and place it where you want to
7:14now it's time for some mascara I'm gonna go with my makeup city of what approved
7:17three the in extra black and for lashes of using the mac 36 for cheeks that's
7:23going to be really easy i'm just going to contour and shape out of my face a
7:26little bit more to give me a little bit more of definition because let's be
7:30honest Ariana has the cutest cheeks they're so flush of the wall so with a
7:35little bit of my illamasqua heroin eyeshadow i am just going to sculpt out
7:39with cheeks a little and then to give my completion a really nice warmth and
7:50going with disobey by illamasqua just applying that over top
7:56i'm also applying that as my blush a little bit then for highlighter I want
8:05to go for this amazing new product
8:07this is by college star and this is the twist
8:10ex-l all over a highlighter comes in a little stick like this and this is the
8:17number one beige two hot oh and it's just a stunning champagne rose gold
8:22highlighter
8:23so actually just going to take a bit with
8:26my finger and tap that where I want to highlight and oh my god this is so

8:39then I'm also padding that down the bridge of my nose and the tip of my nose
8:51Cupid's bow
8:55I love that ok then for those amazing glitter lips I'm first going to line my
9:01lips to give them a little bit more fullness and fall you and that is
9:04definitely what they did on Ariana as well for that i'll be using my lip
9:08contour lip liner by lancome and this is 211
9:13beige rose
9:26and her glittery lips had this really nice I'm soft
9:29Rosie pinky color with a little bit of peach with quite the mix so for that I'm
9:35dabbing on a little bit of lipstick
9:37this is by nicks and this is strawberry milk
9:49so that gives us a nice base color to work with and now for the glitter the
9:53glitters i'll be using our by occ and this is the glitter in pink
9:59very fitting and i'm also going to mix in a little bit of the beige glitter in
10:04the middle so I kind of get this glitter ombre lip going on to make letters
10:08figured something very sticky so I went for the stickiest gloss I could find in
10:13my collection and those are definitely the dazzle glasses by mac and the color
10:18i'll be using today is called the baby Sparks and it has a little bit of that
10:22same colored glitter in there so i figured it's a nice base you want to
10:27remember that wherever you apply the gloss the glitter is going to stick onto
10:31so you want to make this as neat and straight as possible

1:52and then I just start rubbing in
1:54information i want to go for a really
2:00nice traceless foundation that you can't
2:03really detect but it still gives you a
2:05really flawless finish or they'll be
2:06using Mac face and body foundation in c1
2:09and because i want to give them a little
2:10bit more coverage i'm gonna go with my
2:12name
2:13select cover up concealer and this is NW
2:1615 and these together just give you a
2:19really nice flawless foundation without
2:21going too far and then I'm just going to
2:23take some of the foundation and just
2:25tribute it all over my face
2:30that's a distribute and never think
2:33distribute and i'm going to be buffing
2:35this in with my Sigma f80 flat top
2:38kabuki brush to further perfect the face
2:46gonna go with a little bit of concealer
2:47this is max pro longwear in NC 15 and
2:51that's just going underneath my eyes and
2:53on the highest point of my face 24 the
2:55highlight a bit and i'll be doing that
2:58and then with my sigma f 86 tapered
3:08kabuki brush I'm going to buff this in
3:11really easily and really simply and just
3:15what about then
3:16ok 10 be doing is setting this with
3:21powder gonna go with my Chanel natural
3:23loose finish powder in a little time
3:26with Helena hot Claire 20 so i'm going
3:28to do browse and 1i off-camera and then
3:32as always I'll be back
3:33so the first thing I did was a pie base
3:35to my lids to prevent the eyeshadow from
3:37creasing and i use my Mac soft ochre
3:39Paint Pot for this and the first shadow
3:41be using is nylon by Mac what i'll be
3:45doing with nylon is applying this to be
3:49very inner corner of my eyes
3:53also be sure to go right here on the
3:56lower lash line and because christina
3:59also had this color on the inner third
4:01of her lid i'm applying some right there
4:05also
4:08now i'm going to go into this color
4:10right here this is by diamond effects
4:12and this is from the gemstone collection
4:14and this pigment is called Goldstone and
4:17i'm picking some of that up with my
4:19finger and I'm patting it on the outer
4:22half of my lid blending in with nylon
4:26now i'm gonna go into this pigment right
4:28here this is Goldilocks by sugarpill and
4:31mixing this with a little bit of
4:33illamasqua ceiling jail so this is what
4:35my little paste looks like and then you
4:37want to take that with a brush and start
4:41tapping it on between Goldstone and
4:45nylon and softly start blending that in
4:51to give it a really nice diffused blend
4:56and then also of course blend nylon in a
5:00little bit better but just give it a
5:02really nice transition and make it look
5:04really seamless and blended to map out
5:07where my eyeliner to go i'm gonna go in
5:09this black from the softbox etude pellet
5:12and literally all you want to do with
5:15this is a map that eyeliner out for the
5:19other I i did the complete eyeliner with
5:22shadow and when top with the gel liner
5:24now if we take a little closer look at
5:26the other I you want to start off with a
5:28winged liner going all the way up to the
5:30crease i kinda aimed it towards the end
5:33of my eyebrow and then from there you
5:35want to make a cut crease and it starts
5:37up quite thick but it becomes thinner
5:40and thinner once you get to this inner
5:41corner here and they just want to make
5:43your winged liner and just fill this up
5:46and connect the parts and then you want
5:49to do the bottom now it's actually kind
5:51of hard to explain what to do so i'm
5:54just going to show you and speed forward
5:56and I hope then it will be clear
6:01[Music]
6:18[Music]
6:21ok so once you've got the rough shape
6:23you kind of want to add layer upon layer
6:25stroke upon stroke to thicken this part
6:29up here
6:29[Music]
6:40ok now we think is a good time to start
6:44with the gel eyeliner and then i'm going
6:46to use is by Sigma and this is called
6:48wicked and I'm just gonna intensify all
6:52the lines and wherever I feel like it
6:57needs a little bit more i'm just going
6:59to add more you know kind of perfect
7:03shape and then if you want to clean up
7:09the gold part just take a little bit
7:10more of that mixture we made before i'm
7:13just going to read dampen it with my
7:15ceiling gel and then with an eyeliner
7:17brush I'm going to take that mixture and
7:22put it right underneath the black line
7:25and with this you can totally sharpen up
7:29and clean of any mistakes you have made
7:34for the actual eyeliner part across the
7:37lash line going to take my dating joe
7:39black liquid liner by Catrice I wanted
7:41to be quite thick and full because once
7:43you look straight ahead you want to see
7:45nothing but the black and then when you
7:47look down it's like hey I'm gold and
7:54then to connect this part to that part
7:56right here you just want to kind of
7:58raise your eyebrows that this becomes
8:00flat and then from this corner right
8:04here drag it in really feel that up for
8:15the bottom taking the black shadow again
8:17and running it really closely along my
8:21lower lashline and what we're going for
8:24here is that this point right here came
8:26all this way down a kind of want this
8:28align to meet up with it but still not
8:31really connect and meet up you just want
8:33them to know kinda they're missing their
8:36first date so what I'm going to do with
8:38the eyeshadow again is sort of create a
8:41new lower lash line like that and now
8:49you want to pick it up a little bit
8:52ok now we want to create this little
8:57wing right here and that's really easy
8:59to do again take that black eyeshadow
9:01and simply from here create a second
9:10wing and then you just want to connect
9:12it to that bottom
9:17ok i'll be taking this hourglass 1.5
9:24millimeter mechanical gel liner and
9:27going to line my waterline with this
9:29still about half way in and it's super
9:33super pigmented it goes on very easily
9:37and it lasts like a mother fucking rock
9:42the time finally has come for mascara
9:44and lashes and for mascara i'll be using
9:46my waterproof 3d extra black buy makeup
9:50studio and for lashes I'm gonna go with
9:53EXO beauties feline lashes for the top
9:59top portion and for low relations I'm
10:02gonna go with Max 33 i believe and just

1:10get this look then please keep watching
1:12alright guys so let's get started and by
1:14the way don't look at this
1:16don't even want to talk about this one
1:18ok the first i'm going to do is prime
1:20and give myself a really nice base to
1:22work with and I'm gonna go for my Chanel
1:25LeBlanc and I mixing it with becca
1:28shimmering skin Perfector in opal and
1:31these two together just make the most
1:32awesome base to work with ever so that's
1:36going on my fits
1:37ok so I'm going to start or just oh god
1:40good i kinda like how that Chanel
1:44leblanc has a white base because the
1:48kind of you know gives you a little bit
1:50of brightness and and just goodness and
1:54if you ask me that just leaves your skin
1:56looking absolutely Norrish and glowy and
1:59radiant and and just I mean look at the
2:03glow look at the glow girl because we're
2:05doing a katy perry look today
2:07Katy does love her coverage gonna go for
2:09a i'm quite coverage coverage base and
2:16the foundation will be using is by
2:17L'Oreal and this is true match got a new
2:19one in c1 this is the lightest color
2:23available in the Netherlands where I
2:26live pretty farts all this happened and
2:29just i'll be applying it with my finger
2:31placing dogs and then with a brush I'm
2:37going to buff it in and today i'm not
2:39going to go for make a big donation
2:41stippling brush I'm going to change it
2:42up a bit
2:43I'm gonna go for the equivalent from
2:45sigma this is the f80 flat kabuki brush
2:49and I'm just gonna you know both the boy
2:52and with that i actually really like see
2:54one as well it's a little bit more
2:57yellow which I like I'm building up but
3:02i think i need it how I set this in a
3:05couple of videos before and people were
3:07like you don't need it anywhere else
3:09I'm like girl tattoo girl this this one
3:14right here though this is a story
3:16started out so innocent and small and
3:21now it's like Godzilla on my damn face i
3:23am now going to conceal for this i'm
3:25using my Mac Pro Longwear in NC 15 i'm
3:28starting underneath my eyes dragging it
3:34up here i'm going to buff this thing
3:36using my f-86 by Sigma and kept up tap
3:41work work work
3:43land that in
3:50i'm going to set this entire thing using
3:55my chanel necklace finish powder and
3:57number 20 Claire gonna do browse and 1i
4:00off-camera and then it will be back so
4:03the first thing I did was a piñata my
4:05eyelids to prevent that I should have
4:06increasing and i use my Mac soft ochre
4:08Paint Pot for this i'm now going to take
4:11these softbox a to pellet and I'm taking
4:13the whites and also be going into my
4:15naked 3 palette and taking the lightest
4:17color right here and I'm packing the
4:19shade all over the lid up to the crease
4:26and then i'm also with this going to
4:29light of my inner corners and this to
4:32really open up the eyes later on and
4:35taking that strange color from the Urban
4:38Decay Naked 3 only they're really
4:41putting that on the inner corner and can
4:47see how much that brightens up the
4:49entire eye area i love it i'm going to
4:52take strange again and concentrated on
4:57my brow bone and blend out softly now
5:04it's time for the pink eyeliner and
5:05because i didn't have one going to go
5:07with a lip liner and this is max embrace
5:10me this is a lip pencil but it does the
5:13job
5:13you don't have to go and buy out a
5:15liquid pink liner for this especially
5:17because let's be honest how many times
5:19are we going to wear this look outside
5:21so it's really important to keep the tip
5:24of the pencil really fine and sharp so
5:26keep you know sharpening it i'm going to
5:29start off with my first line and then
5:36from there go back on to the lid and
5:42this pink liner can be very thick and
5:46dramatic because recovering it up with a
5:48little bit of black later on as well to
5:51sort of set to look a little bit more so
5:54you can make this really thick
6:00and even when going to the inner corner
6:02even that inner corner has to be applied
6:08a very thickly
6:19and i'm going to take the Urban Decay
6:20electric palette and i'll be picking up
6:23a little bit of savage and with a really
6:25sharp and precise angled brush I'm going
6:29to go over the pencil to set it and
6:33intensify it so this way you won't get
6:36any transfer and also with this you can
6:41go ahead and even out and sharpen out
6:44any lines that you feel have to be even
6:47out and sharpen out you can go ahead and
6:49really get that flick in there and make
6:54it super precise and thin and what I
6:58especially love doing with this is even
7:01that wing out even more now before I
7:06focus on the black eyeliner right here i
7:08want to focus a little bit more on that
7:10line in the crease this is very peppy
7:13and graphic at the same time and i love
7:16that they did this so I'm going to go
7:17back into my saltbox pellet and i'll be
7:21taking this gray color right here so you
7:23just want to follow the shape of your
7:25eye
7:26this goes like that that goes like that
7:28it has a curve here it has a curve here
7:31it goes out straight like that goes out
7:34straight like that you do want to look
7:36straight into a mirror when doing this
7:38because you don't want to play too too
7:39high or too low but you do want to go a
7:41little bit above your natural crease so
7:43that when you look straight forward
7:45it's a little bit higher up
8:04ok now going to do the black line right
8:07here you want to keep it shorter thinner
8:09and nastier than the pink one on the
8:12outside wing you definitely want to meet
8:14the black with the pink but not as long
8:16as the pink and just overall keep it
8:18thinner and shorter and the Islander
8:20amusing is dating Joe Black by Catrice
8:45ok then i'm going to go back into that
8:46gray color from the sauce box a tude
8:49palette and I'm also going to take a
8:51little bit of makeup geeks unexpected
8:53and i'm going to take those two and run
8:56it along my lower lashline really softly
9:01you just want a little bit of definition
9:02there to you know kind of ground the
9:05look on the bottom a little bit more i'm
9:08applying a nude eye pencil this is micah

10:00let's say if you'll contoured which I
10:02did you don't you don't really have to
10:04do it but let's say you have your
10:05contour that has a line like that
10:09exactly above it in the same line you
10:14want to apply your blush so taking a
10:16little bit and just following my contour
10:21and buffing it in so the blush has the
10:27exact same direction as the contour plus
10:32it kind of melts in to the contour as
10:35well then for my highlighter today I'm
10:37going to take the MUA undress your skin
10:40shimmering highlighter I i love this one
10:44I'm just gonna pop that on the highest
10:47point of the cheekbones and kinda in the
10:49same line as the contour blush and then

12:23hopefully I will see you guys on the
12:25next one
0:00hey guys today I'm going to be doing one of my most requested makeup looks and
0:03it's mila kunis now she is just so gorgeous
0:07when I was googling pictures of her to kind of prepare for doing this look I
0:10just thought wow your makeup is beautiful so I'm really looking forward
0:13to filming this
0:14ok so for foundation I'm going to use your skin forever and i'm going to try
0:18and turn out my skin a little bit because my skin is a lot fairer than me
0:21the penises I need to kind of get that all if you look going on as best I can
0:25i'm also using this foundation because it has a very perfect matte finish which
0:28is how Miller was her skin which is doing a red carpet event
0:32i'm using my expert face brush from Real Techniques i'm just going a little
0:36circles all over my skin this foundation smells really good
0:40well it's not like cucumber know if you re creating a celebrity look like I am
0:47and changing the color of your skin a little bit more to dramatically
0:51I'm not going to have exactly the same skin tells me that he is all of a sudden
0:53I look like I've been in the Bahamas for a month but if you change your even a
1:00little bit you just need to make sure that you're blending it down ack sorry
1:03if I keep looking down just in the flip screen
1:06ok so I'm going to come back and properly perfect my skin and powder it
1:09later on once you've done the eyes in case any kind of eye shadow drops down
1:12and then it's just completely around my skin makeup so I'm going to get on and
1:16do the eyebrows and this is Mac chocolate brown and i'm just going to
1:20use it to fill in my brows
1:21now I mean if you start to make up pretty much exactly how i like to do you
1:24mind when i go out which is a nice strong brow strong smoky eye and a nude
1:29lip
1:29it's just so pretty and so wearable and I know that you guys are going to get so
1:33much wear out of this look so i can see why you've been requesting it for ages
1:37i'm just using a mac 26 expression just really gently stroking this through my
1:44brows
1:45if you don't like your brows this strong and pick a color like map Omega and you
1:49can still make the look absolutely gorgeous
1:52some kind of just going with the shape of my brows by adding in a little bit
1:55more of an arch which is just here
2:00I shadow i'm going to use my urban decay naked palette because it just has the
2:03perfect mila kunis eyeshadow colors in it
2:06like seriously just looks like mila kunis that pallet looks just like a i'm
2:11going to start of fries and toast
2:13which is this color here and a mac 217 brush and this is just going to kind of
2:18all over the lid up to the crease
2:21apart from this area here because I'm gonna put lighter shimmery colors in the
2:25inner corners
2:25next I'm taking hustle on a mac 239 brush to make it nice and smoky and dark
2:33so pack the eyeshadow onto the brush and then just push this along the lash line
2:40and stop when you get to come to the center of the lid and then pull it up
2:48and then take your 217 brush again and just blend that and now we're going to
2:53add some more
2:54she was having that same color again and then blending it now I'm going for the
2:59sparkly black which is called creep
3:01so I've just put that kind of over the top of the other color and then I'm just
3:08going to blend it the colors will all blend together and don't worry doc two
3:13black ones that blended in
3:15once you're blending brush gets to Daddy pick up a clean one because otherwise
3:18your eye shadow will start look really messy
3:20just like to wash if you like to do smokey eye makeup so I'd really
3:24recommend investing into blending brushes because it makes a huge
3:28difference to the eye shadow looks now just mix together on my brush hustle and
3:32creep
3:33so the dark brown and the black I'm just going to add a little bit one now
3:44starting to look really smoky and gorgeous now so I'm just going to get
3:47the other eye to the same stage then we'll be back with you but he starts
3:49most of the smokiness on top of the lid down but media often has heard of up
3:54here through her crease a bit of a more golden brown so i'm going to use dark
3:58horse which is this color here
4:00add a touch of that through the crease just in the outer corner and then I'm
4:07just going to blend that very top line with eyeshadow stops so that it looks
4:12very nice and smoky and soft now add some light to the eyes are going to use
4:19thin
4:19I'm going to bring this just through the inner corner and then going to take half
4:23baked which is a bright gold
4:25on a little brush add that on top
4:30let's be honest with you guys you don't need to put it underneath i just put it
4:33on and then thought that doesn't break it said so I spent half baked on top so
4:37you can just go straight on with half baked
4:40maybe use a tiny bit of sin right in the inner corners but on this part here
4:45half-baked looks better on the same little brush I'm going to take a tiny
4:49bit of half-baked just underneath the eyes
4:52me too often wears a lot of bright gold color just under the first part of iron
5:00it really opens the eyes up such a pretty effect and then going back to my
5:05t 39 brush which has all the black and dark brown on it and I'm going to put
5:08that underneath the eye and make sure you really blend that out on the rise to
5:18on a clean 239 brush and just going to use a tiny bit of virgin which is this
5:22one here really light color and this is just going to highlight the brow bone
5:26again immunity is always has black eyeliner all the way around her eyes so
5:32I'm going to use my Rimmel scandaleyes what proof cold gel in black this just
5:37does not budget so good
5:46okay i'm going to cut my eyelashes he's in my shirt more relaxed colors
5:53i'm going to put on lots of my maybe in the falsies mascara
6:00I'm not going to use false eyelashes because mila kunis sometimes she was and
6:03so no she doesn't but she never goes for a full on false eyelash look it's always
6:08just kind of like nice fluttery eyelashes and I think that I can achieve
6:11that with just mascara
6:12if you feel like you need to apply some natural false ones then d
6:15did i say i'm using my maybelline the falsies mascara if I didn't that's why
6:19I'm using
6:28finally that's the eyes done so i'm not going to conceal using my Mac concealer
6:32the studio finish in the color and w 20
6:39ok now to attempt to get me because his cheekbones i'm going to use my Clarence

0:00hey guys this is a I want to film an Arab inspired makeup look because i
0:03think that these makeup looks are amazing if you want to do something
0:06really different for a night out or a special dinner
0:11it's definitely an evening makeup look it's very kind of heavy on the eyes and
0:15tends to be a more community on the lips today I want to do and perfectly one so
0:21i'm going to start a foundation and i'm going to use reference color state and
0:24sand beige I really like this foundation and I don't have any faith in town at
0:28the moment and this is one of the only kind of pale foundation zone so that's
0:33why I'm using this today so i'll just pop some of that into the back of my
0:36hand and I'm going to use my Bobby Brown was called and face blender this is my
0:40favorite foundation brush at the moment I put it in my monthly favorites video
0:44and if you haven't watched 484 favorites ya go and watch it i'll link it down in
0:48the description box
0:49no this is a good color for me sorry I was just checking the colors AK and just
0:55going to blend this is a blend it
0:58I got some kind of buffing it all over my skin but I don't put too much on the
1:03brush to begin with even though i put quite a and love foundation of my hand
1:08lump I feel like to call it and I just take a small amount of that stuff onto
1:15my skin and as i said in my April favorites video this foundation brush
1:19just makes your foundation look beautiful
1:22it seems to put on just the right amount of foundation and it just makes us cool
1:29so flawless but gotta know if you guys can see it's starting to look rather
1:34nice and quite natural as well so what you like
1:37ok now it's time to your eyebrows now because this is an Arab inspired makeup
1:42look I want to do the browse quite strong tends to be a very strong shape
1:47and quite dark
1:49I like to start off with a lighter pencil this is lingering from Mac that's
1:54not too too dark and then i can make them darker
1:58with some eyeshadow internet but if I go straight home with the dark eyeshadow
2:02sometimes it can look a bit too much
2:06I'm just going to softly building up the shape making a little bit thicker so on
2:12this top line here it should be a straight line always go up to a point
2:16and then from that point you want to come down
2:21ok so now i have the shape of the browser and i'm going to take mystery
2:24eyeshadow which the dark matte brown for mac and an angled brush this is a mac
2:31266 brush and I'm just going to do
2:34really feather reconstr oaks throughout the whole brow so doing it this way I
2:41then haven't got a block of mystery eyeshadow on both eyes eyes eyebrows and
2:46it just looks slightly more natural
2:49the eyes you want to start with a creamy eye shadows a base i'm going to use by
2:53Terry shadow stick in the color misty rock then I'm just going to blend that
3:01with my finger
3:03I'm going to put this underneath the eyes as well next I'm going to go in
3:08with tracks
3:09I showed format which is this one here
3:12it's like a meted purple with gold flecks of shimmer annette and i'm just
3:22using a mac 217 brush just about that will leave my lid
3:25I'm just going to take a bit of tracks underneath my eyes as well and this will
3:34give us a really smoky effect next legislative Black Tide for Mac this is a
3:40military black eyeshadow but any location I will do for this debt and my
3:44angled brush i'm just going to put this really close to my lashline next
3:51Sunday's take some quarry eyeshadow which is a matte like meted path we can
3:56I like grayish purple and i'm going to use the zoeva petite crease brush I
4:02really love this
4:03forget increased effort
4:05action as i get the outer corners i'm just going to wing it out slightly and
4:09up towards the brown
4:12so just going through the crease right the way in and out and then flicking up
4:17slightly
4:18now I want to add a bit more of an intense purple so I'm going to take
4:21nocturnal eyeshadow all there is no time I shadow from mac and an angled brush
4:27and just woke up at the quarry eyeshadow
4:30I'm just going to run this through
4:35so if you're looking up with the edge then using the brush that I used to put
4:40Cory through the crease i'm just going to blend that in so i'm not doing a real
4:45kind of cut crease look it's just going to be a subtle kind of version of that
4:50it's time for line and our makeup look would not be complete with liquid liner
4:55that goes right the way into in lip
4:59don't say that by the way into the inner tear duct area like down here and then
5:04clicking all the way out as well
5:06my favorite designer the moment the Loreal superliner I thought the one that
5:10is called black black I'm starting the inner corner
5:14however if you can see that I've bought it right the way down into the corner
5:23if I keep looking down guys because I don't want the eyeliner to print up onto
5:30the eyeshadow just got that line is close to your lash line as possible and
5:35then with your eye open and looking straight ahead into a mirror you want to
5:39put up your wing line and
5:47it's just follow the line up these are my bottom lash line as a guide so as if
5:50my gosh time just carried on and then I just look down and bring join that line
5:58up with the lash line
6:00the reason why i plot out the way with my eye open is because if you do it with
6:04your eyes closed
6:05so now you can open it and then they will be one piece it's always best to do
6:08that with your eye open and then just once you've done the line you can look
6:13down to do you want the infant in
6:17ok so again I'm looking down guys because they don't have much my eyeliner
6:20the classic line a mistake has happened
6:23I've made this one thicker than this one so now i'm just going to make this one a
6:26bit thicker to match up with this one
6:28now he's put some eyeliner on my waterline have chosen to use macs
6:39eyeliner in design a power port it's a beautiful really vibrant purple glitter
6:44eyeliner so I'm going along the waterline with this and then i'm going
6:50to join up and meet their liner in their inner corners just going to add lots of
7:00my maybelline the falsies mascara on my top and bottom lashes
7:12and then going to apply the millie mackintosh so luxurious
7:15it's just pot some glue along the vein of the lash you want to wait for it to
7:21go tacky before you try to apply if you put the glue on and just try and put it
7:24on straight away the glue just will be too wet and it will slide around all of
7:29your i am driving me crazy so I like to just make sure it's a little bit tacky
7:35just going to walk around only for about a minute
7:39maximum or it will be too dry
7:43then I take some tweezers and just grab the lash in the middle and then I just
7:48place it down on top of my natural lashes as close to the lash lines or can
7:52I squeeze in one and first
8:02no just place the other end down use my little finger to kind of hold it down
8:05there until it stopped and that's how I apply lashes and that is the ice
8:10dunno just come in place that you can see them the glue if you can see a
8:14little white bits of clear that will dry clear
8:17so don't worry about that you can see that i'm going to use my collection
8:20lasting perfection concealer in number one fair and then actually is a fluffy
8:24eyeshadow brush to blend this in because i find it just blends in the masses
8:29it's kind of similar to their foundation brush lightly used as well
8:33it's really good for blending under the eyes
8:36now you just need to set your foundation concealer with some powder you can use
8:41any part of your life on Katie's that you're loose powder just because I got
8:45this recently i really want to use in the tutorial so gorgeous and then she's
8:54my Karen's bonds are just to contour my cheekbones and bronze up my skin a
8:58little bit
8:59I just mix the two colors together and it makes a really nice color for me
9:03just bringing this up my temples as well across took my forehead as well because
9:09this just makes your face shape look really lovely
9:11then instead of blush i'm just going to use my mac mineralize skinfinish in
9:15redhead this is an old one
9:16had four years to you can use any kind of mac mineralize skinfinish border or
9:20any kind of shimmery highlighter because i think that blush would just be too
9:24much with this look
9:25so just a bit of this across the top of the cheeks and apples of the cheeks just
9:30makes your skin look so glowy and beautiful and finally for the lips I'm
9:34going to Chanel which cover your shine in the color satisfaction
9:38I am just obsessed with this lipstick at the moment my favorite color
9:42I just think this is the most perfect nude lipstick for me ever
9:49then I'm just going to add a bit of my lip gloss the time your ballot gloss in
9:52the color chic and this is also my favorite nude thing at the moment
9:57they're my favorite nude lipstick is this my favorite nude lip gloss is this
10:01I do have paid the ones in my collection might just peachy and afternoon tea and
10:06but i actually prefer a slightly less pale need because I just think it looks
10:11really beautiful and I'm just obsessed with this lipgloss at the moment you
10:19kind of matches the lipstick perfectly so I'm not adding too much because it
10:25might be majorly glossy just to have a slightly slightly closer to finish and
10:31this is the finished look I really just kind of made up as I went along and use
10:35the Arabic makeup as an inspiration and I just really love how it turned out I
10:40need to make some kind of fancy dinner plans with Jim now because this makeup
10:43look is just too good to waste so I'm definitely going out tonight

10:50would ask that you love to see how you get on

11:49you take a selfie with the new awful that's really hard to say because it
11:53looks so cool
11:55ok see you later guys
0:00hey everyone today I'm going to film a really highly requested video which is a
0:04lily collins makeup tutorial now I can't believe I've never filmed this video
0:08before because I love her makeup looks so much
0:11she's so gorgeous and she's such a lovely gardens while i was lucky enough
0:14to meet her recently at was at the a long common party and she was so sweet
0:21and she took a photo of me for my blog and yeah she's just such a gorgeous
0:25going to make up is just blurs so just when we treat the makeup that i'm going
0:29to be recreating is when she always has beautiful pale skin really dark to find
0:34eyebrows and kind of red glossy lips and and just beautiful flush with eyelashes
0:40that look I'm going to take just type my hair behind what is out of the way I'm
0:44going to start by using the reference colorstay foundation in the color 150
0:47this is sean wha
0:50I just love this foundation the moment it goes through skin so well and
0:54although i am loving my Armani luminous silk foundations well i only have that
0:58in a tab come over i kind of want to get it in the pail as well and at the moment
1:02I have no fake thailand's it's the perfect time to be filming a little
1:05make-up stroke by the way I'm just trying to get some of my brush i'm just
1:09going to buff this into my skin using a believer defined buffer brush I've
1:16already moisturize my skin and use an eye cream so it's prepped with well for
1:20the makeup if you have extra early skill you find your foundation just as last on
1:25you then you could use a primer before the foundation as well I find this
1:29foundation just lost their well I don't need a primer but one of my favorites
1:33and benefit Porefessional i think is called it just makes your skin for
1:37always made me to makeup last longer
1:39now obviously are going to film all of this will this video be like 20 minutes
1:43long but I like to spend a lot of time just working the foundation to my skin
1:47so it looks like my skin just looking really good rather than a layer of
1:52foundation so i'll just keep on puffing away like this until it looks really
1:58perfect
1:59ok now it's time series really thick and strong dark eyebrows i am just a huge
2:05fan of this eyebrow neck you might look at it and be like oh that looks like
2:09everyone knew I hate it but just remember that i re-created Lily Collins
2:13looks so that's what I'm doing my eyebrows . i'm going to use a little
2:16angled brush and mystery eyeshadow from Mac I find when trying to make my brows
2:21a lot bigger than a powder just looks more natural than a pencil
2:24I'm just going to start by following the natural shape my brow reject their don't
2:29have much powder on my brush when it comes to the top part of my eyebrow i'm
2:34just going to go a bit higher the Maxwell brow like that so I got as you
2:40have made it a lot thicker I think it's one actually to make the broth thicker
2:44on the top of that underneath and also it's more flattering as well I'm not
2:49going to high up with the arch because Lily's browser actually quite straight
2:53always want to finish the last clean . i'm just going to see the other one and
3:02then we'll be right back with you but I show that I'm going to use my oven k
3:05naked palette I know use this and like all watching tutorials but it's just so
3:08handy and i'm going to start with the color sin which is this light shimmery
3:12color they're here funny noise my tummy is making the way this rumbling noises
3:17today I don't know why because i have hot breakfast then an angle brush i'm
3:26just going to take the dark horse which is a dark brown to move around club just
3:31going to add a tiny bit right at the lash line for a really natural
3:38definition at least she just looks like my lash line is really thick
3:41next I'm going to contour using buck which is a matte but medium turned brown
3:46color and i'm just going to blend this through the crease of my you always want
3:51to use a matte color when your contouring guys because the idea is that
3:54we're creating a shadow here to get the armoire definition and just keep
4:00blending blending this eyeshadow blending his key guys it just makes a
4:03shadow look amazing
4:07next I'm going to take my mom calm art line now and do the finest line of
4:11eyeliner next I'm just going to use my maybelline the falsies mascara and I'm
4:20not curling my eyelashes
4:21fast because I'm going to be applying some false eyelashes and I just find
4:25them easier to apply when I haven't called mine now it's time for lashes and
4:30i'm going to use the knowledge powerfully the lashes i just love these
4:33because it's not like they don't look like a strip lash because the lashes are
4:38all different lengths that looks more natural and pretty
4:42I'm just popping some theory along the vein of the lash and then I'm just going
4:46to place the lash down as close to my natural lash line as possible and i just
4:54use a combination of my fingers and the tweezers to push it down everything
5:00that's how about my lashes on so it's really really easy and if it starts
5:04going to pick up then just hold your finger down now for a bit longer then
5:09when you lift off should be stuck then i'm just going to use my collection
5:13lasting perfection concealer in number one fair this is the lightest when they
5:17do i love this concealer because the last four days if you have any spots and
5:22blemishes you don't have to worry about touching up and it's just such a lovely
5:27concealer and it doesn't make you break out either i'm just going to drop that
5:31around my nose when i get some redness and then just bending under my eyes to
5:37cover my dark circles beneath bottom lashes mascara i like to use the bottom
5:42lashes mascara because it doesn't smudge and it has a tiny little brush which
5:47helps me really get in now with the little bottom lashes also has put my
5:52memory upto hi I'm going to set my foundation using my second lorry one
5:56heck of a blot powder and i'm a-goin to put this through my t zone which is the
6:02area that i tend to the early i'm going to contour using my balls are chocolate
6:07bronzer and myself for this is the 1 05 Lux highlight brush even this is for
6:12highlighting I like Jesus for contouring and it's absolutely amazing
6:16this little brushes fits in the hollows my cheekbones perfectly and I always
6:21like to put a fish face for this bit on the apples of my cheeks just a little
6:28bit of color I'm going to use my Bobby Brown blush in the color pink coral just
6:33really subtle
6:34and finally for the lips i'm going to use my lip gloss in vampire kiss i have

7:43guys
0:00hey guys today I'm interested in a makeup tutorial because obviously i have
0:03no makeup on and i'm really excited about doing this look because i love it
0:07and wearing a lot recently and it's just a beautiful evening makeup is perfect
0:11for a date night or night a lot of friends and just anything where you want
0:16to go make up really nicely for the evening i guess because it really feels
0:19like an evening look
0:20I think I'm just gonna get my hair out of the way I'm going to start by using
0:24my l'oreal true match foundation because I've been really like mistake videos in
0:29my last tutorial and I just thinks a nice foundation which is close to the
0:33foundation on the back of my hand and I'm using my Real Techniques bold metals
0:37brush in the number one hundred and i really like this Russian foundation so
0:42tend to just kind of adapt on what was
0:46oh no they're just have to build your work outside
0:49I really like you can't hit that and that anyway yeah i'm just going to pop
0:53this all over my skin and if I keep looking for here it's because i'm using
0:57my viewfinder as a mirror
1:00I just love this brush foundation because it's kind of similar to my bobby
1:03brown and bubbly Brown called the baby's face blender but as you know if you want
1:09you two girls before
1:10my name is my book around facebook and i got really mad because it melts
1:15we strive to be crazy and this one doesn't melt and it kind of just the
1:18exact same thing so yeah I'm quite a rough one for my foundation i guess
1:25because the brush is so soft it's not how to my face - it feels like a nice
1:28massage if anything so i just really kind of get in there and you to all
1:34circles like this because i find buffing it in like that
1:37get the nicest affect the function gets a nice effect gives the lights the fact
1:44i guess i'm going to see me now and do my eyes my eyebrows now come back and
1:49finish off my skin and you can see their own powder and blush and bronzer and all
1:52the other lovely things that might put my skin it is evening
1:55my eyebrows i've been loving using the Maybelline brow drama in the color dark
2:00brown
2:00I just think this is just such a nice way to start and the process of kind of
2:05getting better eyebrows
2:08I always find it like my brows the most when i use a couple of different
2:12products on them
2:13I know that sounds really high maintenance but what I just use one
2:16products
2:17it can look really good . and draw in whereas when i use a couple and start
2:21with something like this just to give them a little bit more color and shape
2:26like that looks so much better already and that's just one foot out if i'm
2:32feeling lazy some days I just use this on my browser if I'm going for a real
2:36natural makeup look
2:37but because this isn't even make up look I want to come in a little bit more
2:42no you guys are going to freak out when I lift up this palette and said I'm
2:44going to use on my other house because I'm scared I'm actually going to be
2:49using this one and I have no idea why I've got this color in with all these
2:53blues and greens deck ask for any way that one is Mac corduroy i'm going to
2:58just put a little bit of through to fill in my brows i'm going to mix it with mac
3:02Omega which is this where you have actually blondie color here because that
3:07works really well for the front of my brows so I'm just starting with a little
3:11bit of Omega where Omega hope you liked it

10:56like this side entry sit here using the behind the scenes now i'm looking

11:03then I decided to fiddle with my hair enough i do out right
11:07please give this video a big thumbs up if you enjoyed it and also you may
11:11comment down below telling me what you want me to film next because i don't
11:14have a video idea yet for next sunday
0:06nobody today i'm gonna be showing you how i did this gold I a bold step or red
0:11lip look for the festive season I'm sure there are some of you that have a few
0:15parties to go to
0:16or you just want to know yourself up on christmas day and have a little going it
0:21also you can use this for any time of year so if you're watching this in
0:24February 2016
0:26hi enjoy the video
0:29first thing I need to do is get this mop off my face
0:32so I'm going to put my hair up I've already primed and moisturize my face
0:38so the first thing I'm going to do is to use my foundation to get a kind of more
0:42even base
0:43my skin is not actually as bad as it has been
0:47um definitely improving I've noticed that drinking a lot more water has
0:50helped under and under and around my eyes as well
0:53the foundation i'm going to actually mix together because this is a teeny bit too
0:58dark
0:58this is not as mont blanc and i'm also going to mix it with a bit of Rimmel
1:02wake me up in the shade like porcelain
1:05I'm mostly just to kind of even out the color but also because i want a kind of
1:11jewy look I want to look like a fresh face very kind of healthy and a bit
1:16glowy because it is that time of year where you can go a bit more on board on
1:20the highlight
1:21I think personally and this does that but I don't want to do it too much it's
1:26more of a kind of us summary more of a summary foundation but i'm going to mix
1:31the two together to create kind of the perfect festive foundation concoction
1:37ok base is done I actually look quite pale I think you might be these lights
1:42not sure it's a good we got bronzer and as you can see it is quite and kind of
1:47jewy and quite like highlight e so if you have really again and you don't like
1:53that then I would avoid this but i wanted to go through that
1:57today I'm going to use the charlotte tilbury many miracle I want a dynamic
2:04duo list and and i'm just going to use a tiny bit of that just under my eyes to
2:10cancel out any homes and then going to use this end of sponge and just tap that
2:15in very very gently
2:16i'm also going to put a little bit of the collection lasting perfection
2:22concealer on the back of my hand so I can get my little spots and also
2:29underneath my eyes using the sponge again
2:33wrapping it up I love this concealer because i feel like it really your
2:40connection don't really have any big old spots right now but I've got a feeling
2:47old blemishes
2:48from where I have had them so I'm just covering those up to get more next thing
2:53I'm going to do is powder i'm using the Rimmel stay matte powder in transparent
2:59and i'm also using a real techniques bold metals brush in 100
3:04okay there we go so i have the kind of plain base sorted now I'm going to add a
3:10bit of color and a little bit more depth to my face
3:13i'm going to use one of these and this is a trustee contour stick and i'm going
3:21to take this and I'm going to go underneath my cheek bone in a line going
3:25to look absolutely terrifying but just trust me on this one
3:28also how cute is this packaging thank you is that ok
3:33cute the arms up I'm now going to use this teeny tiny little one
3:37this is actually for contour so this is for doing this because you can either
3:42use the bigger and or you can use a slightly more pointed end and i'm just
3:45going to kind of blend that out
3:47so as you can see you kind of got these little shadows now I quite liked doing
3:55it like that because i find you could be quite precise with it and it blends
3:59really nice and it doesn't quite natural and i am going to go over it just a
4:02little bit with the benefit hoola bronzer and that kind of also set
4:07because it's a cream product then you just want to take the bronze that any
4:10where the Sun would naturally hit
4:13and I sometimes take along my jawline to publish i'm going to use the AL glass
4:17ambient lighting palette
4:19looks like the earth and i'm going to go for this really pretty pink highlighter
4:26shade here in the middle just using the same brush this is a maestro one . now
4:33because i wanted to do glowy and highlight e
4:37I've opted for the mac mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle which I
4:41feel like if you want to go all out
4:43cheekbones this is the perfect product because it is a very very shimmery and
4:50it
4:50it's very perfectly but i'm just not taking it into my temples and dispersing
4:58it basically
5:00oh I forgot to put some lip boy alone i'm using the Clarins instant light lit
5:04up for oil and i'm just going to put that on before i put on my red lipstick
5:08just to give my lips a little bit of moisture next thing I'm going to do is
5:11put an eye base on my eyelids
5:14i'm using the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion antiaging they do say your
5:20eyes are the first thing the age all those laughter lines now while that is
5:24settling onto my eyelids i'm going to go on and do my eyebrows
5:28so for this I use a mac eyeshadow and it is this one which i think is charcoal
5:35brown and and I'm then using a mac 266 angled brush
5:40I just find that angle brush is a lot more precise and I feel like I fill
5:46those in quite quickly
5:47you don't have any of you have noticed but I've been trying to grow my eyebrows
5:51out a little bit and it has been quite a challenge
5:56there's just little parts of my eyebrows that won't grow as you can see on this
6:01side
6:02I've got a little gap here on this side of got quiet out here so I'm having to
6:06just fill those in so it looks a bit more England
6:09I do always tell people my one bit of beauty advice is to not do your eyebrows
6:13yourself is to always go to somebody and have them done professionally because i
6:18find that they know what they're doing a lot more than I do but also they can
6:24advise you on how to grow them or how best to fill them in to suit your face
6:29shape and and it's honestly just the best thing I've ever done i wish i had
6:34done it when I was younger so then I wouldn't be having to try and grow more
6:38in a 25 year old and I was a serious overclocker when i was younger i
6:46probably need to go slightly dark and naturally on the eyeshadow powder but
6:50because I've lightened my hair recently like quite a lot I go for somewhere in
6:56between
6:56ok so now I look crazy with the eyebrows i guess that during my eyes everything
7:00kind of merges in a little bit more
7:02I want to go for a really kind of subtle smokey gold I because I feel like that
7:07goes really well with a classic red lip and i don't know i just i like it so so
7:13for the base color I'm going to pop a little bit of this on and this is the
7:17colour-pop cream gel color in
7:20show me it's very beautiful you can do this with your fingers but i'm going to
7:24apply a little bit of that on a sigma short shader brush
7:28ok so now we roughly got this color on the eyes I've zoomed in a little i'm
7:32going to put a little bit of urban decay's dirty suite which is this one
7:39over my entire eyelid
7:41and then going to take this little brush again and walk that in there and go just
7:49underneath
7:52ok now with a sigma blending brush I'm going to go in the crease with the same
7:59color that I used my eyebrows which is Mac chocolate brown
8:03i'm going to just blend blend blend and then going to take a little bit of the
8:06same color and just join that into the middle of the lower lash line where I
8:11put the gold and then using a tapered blending brush by Sigma i am going to
8:17lend that a little bit more and then add a little bit of highlight and my brow
8:21bone and highlight i am using Mac's nylon my lord i always try and be so
8:30professional in these videos when we all know I don't know what I'm doing
8:35I'm just fluking this case that eyes almost done the only thing i'm going to
8:40do now is add a little bit of mascara i'm not going to do any liner on this
8:44one because i feel like the lips is kind of more of a statement the mascara i am
8:49using is the Maybelline lash sensational i always forget what this is called even
8:55though it's like my favorite thing ever
8:58at this stage you could also add some false eyelashes or performance Cara
9:02whichever way you like to do it but my lashes are actually quite long and curly
9:05so I really struggle with lashes and I don't really feel like I need to add
9:09anymore to them for this look
9:12however a few individual lashes my look quite nice but let's be honest I'm
9:15rubbish at lashes
9:16unless I've got time here to do them for me they always look crap though I'm just
9:21gonna go for just mascara for this lip
9:24ok it's time to do the lips ok so the oil is pretty much ripped off this look
9:29I wanted to use quite a bright cherry red because I feel like that's quite
9:33festive and so I'm going to use a color pop lip liner this is in the shade
9:39days it's slightly darker than the actual color but i wanted to do it that
9:44way
9:45these are kind of like liquid lipstick they're amazing and the pigmentation is
9:48so intense and they're really long-lasting which is why I thought it
9:51would be really good for like night out makeup and so I've gone for the
9:56colour-pop ultra matte lip in the shade
9:58succulent I'm just gonna give that a moment to dry
10:03ok so you can either leave it like this and it's quite maps and it looks
10:08I think very very pretty see sometimes I like a shimmery kind of lip gloss lip
10:12and sometimes I love a matte lip and I think this color looks amazing as a map
10:17but i'm thinking of putting a bit of red lip gloss on top so i'm using tiny birds
10:23lip gloss in the color
10:24Aphrodite very gorgeous there we go you have the perfect red lip for christmas i
10:31just realized i don't think i've ever done a red lip look on my channel before
10:36which is crazy because you guys know how much I love a red lip especially around
10:40this time of year so yeah this is the finished makeup
10:44I'm not really going to do too much with my hairy think it's kind of I mean it's
10:49okay
10:50right how it is but a hair is so soft right now holy shit man is ok so for

0:00hello everyone today I wanted to do a video around the theme of valentine's
0:03day whether you love it or you hate it
0:06whether you're single and loving the single life of feeling super independent
0:10and don't need no one
0:11or I don't know why we don't get our or you are with someone and you're super
0:15loved up and you can't wait to spend the day with them having said that I don't
0:19really think that we just need one day of the year where we have to express our
0:22love and admiration for someone I feel that it should be all year round
0:26that's my only gripe with Valentine's Day or maybe you're just having a night
0:29out with your friends either way if you want to do something with your makeup
0:32then I have a look for you
0:33I decided for this tutorial only to use drugstore makeup item so the things that
0:37you would find in boots and superdrug mainly because a lot of you are asking
0:41for this
0:42and so I felt it was perfect and especially since I wanted to send to
0:47this hole around my favorite lipstick which is the remote Kate Moss 17 plus
0:51i'm just gonna throw this out there but you don't need to do yourself up for
0:55anyone
0:55you only want to do it for you because it makes you feel great and because you
1:00enjoy it
1:00that being said i am now going to show you how I did it
1:04ok so i'm just going to clip my hair back out of the way and the first thing
1:09I'm going to use is my beloved remote much perfection foundation i'm just
1:15going to be putting this all over my entire face and the brush I'm going to
1:18use is one of the Real Techniques bold metals in what I one which is like a
1:24kind of 3d triangle shape
1:30yeah
1:35I am a huge fan of this foundation
1:38I really really like it and i would say that it's probably good for all skin
1:42types
1:43it's not it's not massive coverage but it's definitely a buildable also feel
1:48like it gives my skin a really nice kind of fresh Julia which is always good
1:54ok now i'm done with foundation i'm going to move onto concealer and it's
1:57going to be absolutely no surprise to any of you that i am using the
2:00collection lasting perfection concealer actually have two shades I've got one
2:04which is fair which I'm going to pop underneath my eyes and then i have to
2:08which is cool medium which I'm going to put everywhere else on my skin and I
2:12need it
2:20ok now that i look crazy
2:24I'm gonna blend it and to do that I'm going to use this
2:28Real Techniques brush which i think is for eyeshadow but i really get the
2:31concealer and it's the bold metals 200 and I'm just gonna dab it on and blend
2:38it in
2:39tend to use a slightly lighter randomized because i feel like it really
2:41brightens and lift any kind of darkness but i have them to their which I
2:46generally do have so I quite like to you like to one there and then kind of my
2:51skin my actual skin tone for the rest of my face
2:58for my power . i am going to use the remote stay matte and this is in the
3:03color 003 peach blow
3:06I really like this because it just adds a little bit more depth
3:09normally I like to use a transparent one which you can also do if you want to but
3:12recently i've been using one with a touch of color it i'm going to use the
3:16road techniques old metals in 100 stepped up up up come up come up
3:24yeah
3:32powder done it's now time for bronze r which i think is one of my favorite
3:37stages because i feel like it just instantly makes your face look like it
3:41has some sort of dimension to it because right now I could literally be a 2d
3:45image
3:46oh no just stop this in my bronzer but how is that even possible
3:51not exactly the smallest mirror i'm going to use the same brush and I'm just
3:55gonna dump that on that the bronzer i'm using is glam bronze by L'Oreal i love
4:02this bronzer i use this a lot during the summer
4:05it's pretty much my it has like the smallest kind of Goldie shimmer in it
4:11but besides that it's pretty much a matte bronzer so you don't have to worry
4:15about too much Yuma
4:28the bronzer is done it's now time to move on to the blush i am using the
4:33bourgeois russia in 34 rose d'or not like a pulley door but like Addie
4:39' oh this is super pretty and really actually quite pigmented for this i'm
4:46going to use the Real Techniques 300 possibly one of my favorite ones and it
4:51is beautiful its rose gold and it's really small and really good for blush
4:57application especially when you want to be quite precisely you've got small
5:00cheeks
5:01I'm going to sneeze I think yeah we're really went for that
5:07don't you just hate when you're around we don't really know and you can't fully
5:11go for a siege not fully commit into the sneeze
5:14so you kind of withhold your sneeze and you kind of end it was going like the
5:19worst such a waste of the sneeze
5:23yeah
5:25and i love this blusher so much it's so pretty it almost gives like a rose gold
5:31affect your cheek but you can see the pink but you can also see like gold
5:34shimmer coming through it looks so pretty
5:37I don't know if you can see that but it looks so shiny and pretty on my cheek so
5:41it also act as a highlight as well I brought the camera closer so you can
5:45have a proper look at the skin
5:47I think it looks really nice and it looks really pretty with the blush on it
5:51now i'm going to get onto the eyes because I want to make this quite a
5:55subtle but smokey eye and focus quite a lot on the lips
6:01I'm going to make this quite neutral so i'm using the soap & Glory lister a real
6:07is called it's really good it has pretty much every color you would ever need if
6:11you just want to do a basic neutral i am going to use this shade here which is
6:15pretty much just a matte cream slush white and the brush I'm using is a real
6:20techniques base shadow brush
6:30to give it a bit of highlight I'm now going to use one of the colors in the
6:34collection little mix about the I all about the eyes palette
6:38this is about to 99 and it's actually amazing it has really nice colors in it
6:44I'm gonna go for this one which is the light one because it has a little bit of
6:47shimmer to it
6:48mostly just focusing on the inside corner because you know i'm all about
6:53the eyes felt the eyes
6:55little mix palette i'm also going to put a little bit underneath my brow bane
7:05ok next is to pop a bit of the dark color in my crease so i'm going to go
7:10back to the lid stuff palette and I'm going to take this matt brown and i'm
7:15just going to work that into the crates to do that I'm going to use the Real
7:19Techniques angled eyeshadow brush because you know i'm all about those
7:24angles about the eccles in a shadow brush
7:39i'm also going to take this color which is like a dark brown with a hint of
7:47shimmer in it
7:49i'm going to use this brush which is the real techniques - 01
7:53whoops which I dropped I'm just going to dab a tiny bit of that and just really
7:57concentrate back more in the crease
8:04ok so there's both eyes done with eyeshadow the next step is obviously
8:08eyeliner
8:09now I couldn't find one in my collection that was strictly just from boots or
8:15superdrug in the kind of make up section
8:19however I do have an urban decay which isn't technically drugstore or high
8:24street but you can buy in some boots so I'm going to pass this off just for now
8:29but if any of you have any good recommendations for any others that are
8:33slightly cheaper then leave them in the description so other people can see your
8:37comment
8:42you want to follow your bottom lash line up
8:59this is drying out on me they're just like drawing on the back of my hand
9:04one done now is the tricky part where you have to make the other I the same as
9:09this I
9:15next thing you'll do is add mascara and I want my lashes to be as big and
9:19dramatic as they possibly can
9:21you could also add false lashes
9:24I don't have any right now and for me
9:28they generally tend to ruin my makeup because I'm not very good at them
9:32unless you have a friend in which case they can help you for your false eyelash
9:37wizard and you're just really good at it but right now i am using the bourgeois
9:43volume clubbing ultra black for dramatic eyelashes
9:50boom
9:59ok so now it's time for me to fill in my eyebrows and to do this i'm just going
10:03to use a powder eyeshadow and i'm going to use the brown from the soap & Glory
10:07palette and I'm just going to fill those in with a angled liner brush
10:20so now that your whole face is complete it is time to add the lipstick
10:25now this is my favorite lipstick ever ever i am obsessed with this
10:30I feel like this shade of red really suits my skin tone and and I would just
10:34I reach for all the time it's my Rimmel Kate math 107 which is this beautiful
10:40dark red
10:41so I'm just going to apply this on my lip
10:59and now you have it that is one look that you could use for Valentine's if
11:04you have any special plans or even if you don't
11:07I hope you enjoyed this video and let me know what you think about sometimes day
11:10whether you've got any nice plans or if you're just staying at home and chilling
11:14with your friends
11:15also if you recreate this look I would absolutely love to see it so don't
11:18forget to tag me on instagram or send me your twit pics so i can see for myself
11:24thanks so much for watching guys I will see you next week
0:00hello everybody as you can see i have 0 makeup on and that is because i wanted
0:04to do my makeup on camera with you so you could see what I was doing have done
0:09an everyday makeup look I'm not going to say tutorial because as we all know all
0:13i do is put my makeup on and ramble a camera
0:16not necessarily the way that you're supposed to do it but this is the way I
0:21like to do it and you guys really like these videos so i wanted to do another
0:24one
0:24I haven't done an updated everyday makeup look for a really long time so I
0:30felt it was about time i did that and i'm really enjoying a lot of the makeup
0:35that i'm using at the moment so i really want to miss Kier
0:38the first thing i'm going to be doing is popping on my foundation the foundation
0:41i have been using an absolutely loving at the moment is the Rimmel lasting
0:45finish this promises to last for 25 hours now i can't say i've actually worn
0:50it for 25 hours because I put makeup on in the morning i take off at night so I
0:55can't say that that works because I've not tested that but i absolutely love it
1:01I love the coverage
1:02i love how it feels on the skin and it is a full coverage foundation so avoid
1:07if you don't like that but i am loving this at the moment
1:11also the brush i am using is the Sigma round kabuki
1:16I really like using kabuki brushes just because I like to kind of buffer into
1:21the skin rather than like stroking on and and this is my kabuki of choice and
1:29you can see my skin is already looking a lot more even
1:33but i do still wanna put on some concealer
1:36so on my blemishes i'm going to put the urban decay naked skin and under my eyes
1:43I'm going to go for the collection lasting protection get those knees
1:49you you
1:53well the less you now to wake myself up a little bit and pop some of the
1:59concealer under my eye I kind of bring it down from the kind of inside of my
2:04eye down towards the top of my cheekbones and then up my cheekbones
2:09but just find that kind of works and then I just blend it in again just using
2:14the same thing kabuki
2:16now that i look far more awake I have absolutely no dimensions to my face
2:21whatsoever
2:22I'm going to powder the powder have been really liking at the moment is this one
2:27it buy it buy by Terry and it's the hyaluronic hydra powder
2:33it's really really fine so I find that it goes on my skin really nicely
2:39oh gosh dropped all over my jeans
2:42i'm just going to use this brush which is B Sigma blush at mine to do a little
2:48bit up in a little bit
2:51that i am going to very lightly sweep this in any areas where I find that my
2:58makeup goes a little bit patchy fast or I can sometimes get a little bit oily
3:03throughout the day which is generally my t-zone
3:07i also like to do a little sweet under the eyes just to set my concealer and
3:13then I kind of find that it lost a lot better throughout the day
3:16next up is bronzer it's January everyone skin looks a little bit invisible little
3:22bit pale
3:23so I think I probably do overdue the bronze slightly interested in January in
3:29december but yes i am going to use not as we going to do a little bit of
3:33contouring and then i'm going to use this guerlain terracotta bronzer which
3:38you will know I'm absolutely absolutely up with absolutely obsessed with this
3:43adds a little bit of warmth
3:45where is this is slightly more than a sheet own blush to this works well as a
3:49kind of contour color hair do the overall bronze first i'm going to use
3:53the same brush
3:54you'll notice I use a lot of the same brushes I don't know if that bad or not
3:59but I mean they all do the job don't you
4:02I'm just kind of taking this across my forehead and on top of my cheeks and
4:07down by my jaw
4:09also don't forget to take it down your neck slightly because if you put a lot
4:13of bronzer on your face you don't want a different color face to your neck
4:17so try and tie it all in there we go
4:21I mean I'm not trying to look like i've been on holiday for a week but I do just
4:24want to add a little bit of color just think it makes me look a bit more
4:27healthy you know
4:29now i'm going to go in with a tiny bit of contour I'm not really this too much
4:32but I like to just do it slightly so this is in maestro 24 brush
4:38it's kind of like a fluffy contour brush and I'm just
4:42I / little bit of this on here papi tap may have gotten slightly overboard there
4:50crap ok there we got a slight bit of contour
4:57now it's time for the blusher i am using the bourgeois rose d'or Golden Rose
5:05blush
5:05this is a beautiful slightly shimmery blusher with some kind of gold running
5:11through it
5:11very very pretty I'm going to pop a little bit on my brush
5:15this is the maestro 143 I really liked my story brushes
5:18let me read to be soft and really really love me to use a little bit of color
5:23much better the last thing I'm going to put on my face is this which is the back
5:29are shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone
5:34this is incredible I am obsessed with this
5:37I placed a fairly large order on court beauty and this was in it because I hear
5:42a lot of people talking about the becker highlighted and how amazing they are so
5:47I wanted to give it a go
5:49and honestly it's amazing I'm gonna put a little bit of eye primer on i have got
5:54the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer antiaging edition
5:58not that I feel as they my eyes are sacking already but you know where you
6:03can prevent it you should I am NOT looking forward to getting back you guys
6:07really know huh
6:10I don't know if I've ever said this before but if you don't have an
6:13eyeshadow primer i would strongly suggest you invest in one there's quite
6:17a lot of different brands that do them but i just find it really makes a very
6:22huge difference with how your eyeshadow applies and how long it lasts
6:26and also how it looks I just feel like it looks a lot nicer when you've got an
6:31eyeshadow base and you don't have one you should get one
6:34I've been doing this like every day for the past two weeks however with
6:38eyeshadow
6:39I kind of very up quite a lot I have
6:41doggy clawing at my legs you want to come up
6:45do you want me to do your makeup
6:48we are so needy
6:52aren't you haven't finished yet don't look at my face just done it
6:57No as I was saying before i was rudely interrupted by snorting very black dog
7:04is that are used kind of a variation of different eyeshadows every day there's
7:09not really one go to eyeshadow look I'll do a kind of mix it up quite long as
7:14we've got a lot of eyeshadows but one pallet that i have been using quite a
7:19lot is this one which is the Too Faced chocolate palette
7:22it's called chocolate bar and it has lots of really lovely kind of neutral
7:28shades in it which obviously are kind of my go-to shades
7:32I'm gonna go hazel that which is this gorgeous color here
7:35kind of like a bronze color
7:39don't worry if this part is messy by the way I'm aware i look really freaky right
7:44now but this bit doesn't need to be particularly neat
7:47I mean that's what i tell myself anyway because you can do the blending brush
7:50and make it look so much better at the end was it going to take another little
7:54brush these are my story brushes again and I'm going to take that color
7:57underneath
7:58we don't all need to hate cleaning yourself thank you very much
8:02what I definitely look slightly terrifying right now going to use port
8:07sugar oh no this is semi sweet semi-sweet which is open , which is this
8:13shade
8:14I'm going to take that in me crees
8:18I always like to have a lighter color in the corners of my eyes
8:22so I'm going to use marzipan which is this gorgeous kind of pinky champagne
8:26color and i'm going to pop a little bit of that in the corners
8:30now i'm going to fill in my brows of my trusty Mac charcoal brown and I also
8:36dabble a little bit of this one in too because my browser kind of dog right
8:43browse let's do this les habia
8:50using a little angled brush this is the Sigma small angle e65 thought my hand is
8:57bleeding man that was really weird i was like oh my god no blood they're just
9:02going crazy
9:03I feel like I've done quite well at growing my eyebrows out slightly
9:06ok my brother done i am very happy with them i'm also going to put a little bit
9:10of nylon and my brow
9:13just to give it a little bit cheeky highlight because you can never go wrong
9:17with a little bit cheeky I life
9:19football for hope it's also nice to kind of blend into the brown because then it
9:28kind of makes it less harsh
9:30I'm obsessed with this brush this is the Sigma tapered blending e-40 it's so big
9:37and so fluffy and i love it
9:40just not sure doing makeup with a runny nose is that attractive
9:45my nose is like running like a tab I'm like having to edit out lots of me like
9:51sniffling the tissues next up is a little bit of mascara
9:55this is my favorite because it just felt is completely transforms the whole look
9:59and I'm using the Maybelline lash sensational course and i found one in
10:04extra black
10:05I don't know how much more black this is in the black one but it looks extremely
10:10black and that's cool because i like black mascara also can't get this off so
10:16I managed to get it off the top car get off the block so I've just got like
10:20cellophane wrap around my mascara got back to black get my hair dyed night
10:26that album is one of my fav albums of all time
10:31laughs shit on dunzo
10:36next up army it now I've been going crazy or neutral lip that moment or new
10:42lip and this one came in my p.o box and I thought it looked really lovely and i
10:47have been wearing this for about a week and it is the wild about beauty lip
10:51pencil geo in 01
10:54Fiona it comes with the big kind of lip pencil on one end and then a line on the
11:01other end so i line my lips with this side and then I fill it in with this one
11:05and that is the finished look I really hope you like it
11:09I'm pretty much obsessed with that hence why I've been doing this every day for
11:13like the past two weeks

11:32give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I'll see you
0:00how everybody today i wanted to do a makeup look
0:03now i don't do this very often on my channel because i'm not a professional
0:06my technique is probably a bit crappy but you guys like the makeup that I
0:12managed to and i have been wearing a look quite a lot recently which is a
0:17gold shimmery eye and a pinky nude lips so i thought i would do that for you in
0:20today's video we're going to do is pin back my crazy wild most annoying orange
0:26they're my friends have a very love/hate relationship sometimes it's applied to
0:30incorporate other days I kind of want to go at it with a pair of scissors are
0:36today is one of those days
0:38I'm going to make this kind of a chatty video because I hate making videos where
0:43I'm not talking with you guys because it feels weird
0:47I was going to kind of put a little bit of music and voice over and then I
0:51remembered
0:51I'm crap voiceover so i'm not going to do that I'm just gonna chat with ya
0:55i'm using the NARS sheer glow foundation have been loving the new one which are
1:01cannot remember the name of now it was in my favorite
1:03I've been loving that but I've also still be loving my trusty my trusty
1:08share globe which are do have a pump for I've just realized i just have to put it
1:12on the new bottle just anyone else is not bottles do that
1:16the lid is not central to the front of the bottle and if I don't do it like
1:23that it's too loose
1:24see all yes issues first world problems i am going to use this brush which is
1:32the Sigma 3d HD kabuki
1:35this looks incredible i'm not actually uses before so I'm very excited
1:42foundation done i am now going to move on to my concealer and it's going to be
1:54absolutely no surprise to most to be that i am using the collection lasting
1:59perfection concealer going to pull it all back my hand because i do have some
2:04spots at the moment and I don't want to be spreading that so it's always wise to
2:09do that I'm going to use the same sort of brush but this is the 3d HD precision
2:15brush by Sigma and its kind of information one funny little angles
2:21don't you got to adapt up coming up we're going to dipped up and i'm going
2:28to really lightly just put that over any of my blemishes
2:41i also have quite a bit of redness around me knows that always an area i
2:46have to kind of concentrate on as well
2:48it's really good for getting in there was little it looks and cranny
2:53I never really concentrate on what my face looks like what I'm doing that I
2:59can only imagine the sort of faces
3:01you probably won't even come after we edit them out because I'm in charge
3:10ok now that my face is completely done like the base
3:16I want to put a bit of powder on now I'm filming this on white bed sheet and this
3:23is the loose powder I'm a little worried I'm going to get this absolutely
3:27everywhere but this is the Delilah up your touch micro-fine loose powder in
3:32translucent this powder is in credible is so fine you don't even feel it on
3:38your face and I find that it sets my makeup amazingly and makes it last a
3:43really long time and also doesn't make my face look cakey for a very long time
3:47I avoided powders because I like my face it up to me I like my face looks full of
3:51life and when I saw people kind of read mattifying their face and putting a lot
3:56of powder and I was like should I be doing that
3:58I'm not sure I'm it is good to set your foundation because it is a cream and
4:03it's going to kind of move around a little bit easier but during this makes
4:07it last a lot longer and not all powders make your face look cakey not all powers
4:11feel heavy and all powders give a really matter of fact either
4:15which one the power of my face i'm going to use two brushes and use this one
4:19which is the Sigma powder
4:20flash flash in f10 and i'm going to lightly down flat and then I'm just
4:29gonna dust that across most of my face
4:39mostly just concentrated on areas where my makeup kind of disappears first which
4:44is generally my t-zone and then going to go with a smaller version of that which
4:50is the extravaganza tapered blending e-40 i'm just going to take a tiny bit
4:56on that and i'm going to go underneath my eyes just to set my concealer a
5:00little bit
5:04oh I got something in my eye ah got it
5:10happy with that I'm happy with that if what do I do next
5:13all blush or bronzer i'm going to use this which is the CRT London
5:17i'm saying that right ciate I like this because it is a matte bronzer and it is
5:24a really good shade for my skin
5:26not too dark the color is Palm Island we use this one which is the Sigma blush
5:32s-92 i'm using all Sigma brushes
5:36today I'm really impressed of them right now
5:40no I'm singing to my god
5:54and i'm sure you are all aware by now when you put bronzer on you want to put
5:59it on all the places that the Sun would naturally make you a little bit bronze
6:05I feel like bronze it works really well with this lip because it's quite gold
6:10and it's quite kind of kinky and i think a more bronzy look goes really nicely
6:16with this so I do put a little bit more bronzer on than I normally would but I
6:20just think it works really well and since this one is kind of coming out
6:24kinda works
6:26I think this yeah don't think for blusher
6:31i am going to use the Charlotte celebrate cheek to cheek push and pop
6:37Russia
6:38I love this I think it has a kind of sunkist being out on holiday look to it
6:44and as I just mentioned with the bronzer I kind of feel like this ties in quite
6:48nicely with that pretty well i'm using the power blush again use brushes how
6:57you want to use brushes don't follow the rules be a brush rebel
7:04just popping out on the apples and bring it back
7:08pretty sure that's not technical town 15 much on the cheek and this is why you
7:13should never take my advice as a professional because i am not one and
7:17sometimes I put too much on and I look like I'm going out
7:22that's fancy dress ok rectify the problem
7:25next I'm going to move on to the eyes which is you know my favorite part
7:29I'm i'm going to be using my by Terry on Bray black star in the color beyond gold
7:35because it is beautiful and this is a golden look and I kind of feel like this
7:40is the perfect thing to you or just whatever never shut it probably last
7:43time i used it if it's not dried out
7:45ok well now i wish i'd had my eyebrows threaded before from this video don't
7:49look too closely looking out
7:51i'm going to put the gold on my entire eyelid
7:56you don't really have to worry about this looking super super pretty and also
8:00really nicely blended because this is kind of the base
8:14also going to drive a tiny bit under the eye just this way
8:18next I'm going to use the sea otter London collins avenue loose kind of
8:23shimmer gold pigment
8:25this looks incredible on the eyes so I actually going to use the Sigma blending
8:31e25 to pack that on
8:46see how morning was never guys just not the way you hold the mirror just not
8:51ours so she could keep your hand in it but I also feel like this mix my
8:56blue-eyes it's very blue eyes
8:59so far now i am going to use another fluffy brush
9:04this is the type of blending be 35 and I think about you . color into the crease
9:09so for the crease i'm going to use buck which is a color in the first original
9:15urban decay naked palette i'm just going to put a tiny little bit that in there
9:18and blend in
9:19only to give it a bit more depth but be honest I quite like leaving it at that
9:25i'm also going to take this brush brush
9:34ultratech this branch i'm also going to take this brush which is the Sigma short
9:40shader e20 i'm going to go in with the same color and just have that kind of in
9:47the outer corner bring it into the goals I / in already
9:54ok I'm happy with that so now i'm going to move onto eyeliner i like to use a
9:59brown pencil and just smudge it on my top lash line for this look because I
10:03think it kind of keeps it casual
10:05rather than going all out with a big cat I which normally i returned to do but I
10:10quite like just having the brown
10:12marjina
10:24you got to say that the eye line that i use is the eye of or I of hora hora
10:30I think it's for us I'm not sure and it's just a brown brown pencil
10:36now i'm simply going to use the other end of the pencil too much that out just
10:40a tiny tiny bit
10:44there we go now for mascara i am using my trusty benefit roller lash which I am
10:54obsessed with skill
10:59look at the difference in the eyes
11:05and i also am a scar on the bottom lashes type of gal i know not everyone
11:09liked to do it the idea because I felt like opens at my eyes slightly now it's
11:16time for my eyebrows
11:17I always love using this actually forgotten what it's called I've got it
11:22in a quad this is kind of like my most used mac colors and i always use this
11:26one I think it's called soft charcoaled not definitely hold that candy chocolate
11:33brown
11:34I was close soft chocolate chocolate brown chocolate brown is the color that
11:38I will always use in my eyebrows so i'm going to use that color and i'm also
11:43going to use an angled brush where ru angled brush here is this is the Sigma
11:49small angle e e65 now we have focused
11:56I tend to start in and then kind of work my way through
12:04well I drop the brush at the moment I'm trying to grow my browser bit thicker so
12:10it is quite a challenge putting them in if any of you get your brows done you'll
12:15know how much more easy it is once they've been threaded or waxed or
12:20however else you maintain your brows to actually fill them like sometimes you
12:24don't even need to do anything I haven't had mine tinted all threaded for a while
12:29so this takes a bit longer
12:32the moment it go hard trying to make them look the same but remember ladies
12:38I browser sister's not twins tell myself
12:42most days ok now that my rather done and i'm feeling so much more human
12:48i am going to go straight in with the lipstick and lipstick i'm using is the
12:53kate moss number 38 which is this gorgeous
12:58pinky nude kind of thing
13:02nude generally the words how many kind of makes me go whoo
13:06maybe because i don't want salmon and also because someone pink just isn't a
13:11nice sounding color is also not really the most flattering color to wear
13:16what's on your lips it looks beautiful and very unfair she
13:23oh my god I just love these lipstick so very much
13:37I've basically been loving doing this look obviously without the pressure of
13:43the camera and making sure I don't screw up anywhere and I do it a lot quicker
13:48than that
13:49normal on a day-to-day basis I can do that pretty quickly but there are all be
13:53watching this so the pressure is unreal
13:55I don't really know what I'm going to call it may be golden
13:58salmon sounds like a recipe maybe a work call it that

0:10autumn makeup look this is the look that I've been wearing quite a lot recently
0:13and a lot of you have been asking me how I've done it and which products I've
0:17used to do it so I thought it would be good to do a kind of updated version
0:22because i have actually done this video last year and it is very very similar
0:26although now i am using slightly different products so it's kind of
0:29basically an updated or to make up routine have brought back my little
0:33autumn tree much too i'll be absolute horror because he hates that term and
0:38I've got a candlelit down here which is leaves my body works and it smells

0:46a little bit of a spot crisis but that's okay cause so it's like everyone else in

1:23shade i am his ivory like a little ice gem

2:06so any areas that i need to put a little bit of concealer on with my spot
2:11I'm just going to put it on the back of my hand so don't want to transfer
2:15bacteria into the pot I'm going to use my beauty blender which is a new
2:20addition to my makeup one I actually really like I feel like this is going to
2:27be in my favorites this month
2:29ok naughty puppy naughty puppy
2:34no you're not supposed to eat that no this is not a game
2:40come on you can get out I always feel like if you spend a bit more time making
2:45sure your base is good then everything else kind of follows quite easily just
2:49going to put a little bit of the fat and my eyes
3:01ok concealer and foundation done it is now time to powder
3:04I am actually going to use the mac studio fix powder
3:08this is a little bit more of a heavy coverage i know some people that use
3:11this just for like foundation but i just wanted to try it i bought the other day
3:15because so many people rave about it that I kind of just when I got it
3:20i'm using my Sigma blush brush in s-92
3:31now it's time for bronzer and i have been loving hula by benefit i have this
3:37in my favorite so I'm going to watch some of that on and i'm going to use the
3:40same brush actually
3:51I'm not going to charlotte tilbury film star bronze and globe Scott and
3:55highlight just add a little bit more definition
3:58I can see floaty stars does that mean I'm about to say
4:02nah I'll be fine
4:10I'm not going to use a little bit of the highlight and pop that on the tops of my
4:15cheekbones or whatever cheekbones of God got great cheekbones and the Coney Jolie
4:25she's got beautiful cheekbones always stare at them whenever she talks to me
4:31that night
4:33next is Kiko and blusher in tribal soul baked blush in wild mode
4:40this is amazing I pretty sure to put this in a favorite at some point but
4:43it's really very beautiful and smells like vanilla and try it doesn't taste of
4:53vanilla
4:58and the brush I'm using for this is the maestro 148 which is one of my all-time
5:03favorite brushes it's just amazing
5:06i'm going to put a little bit of eye primer on this is the estee lauder pure
5:12color in to which is halo and it's just a really lovely kind of match Paige
5:18I mean if that's lovely at all i don't i don't know if that's what you're not
5:22smart kind of rank though not going to lie
5:34zoomed in a little bit so you can see the eyes of it clear i do want to just
5:38quickly apologized this tape my eyebrows
5:40i'm currently waiting to get them threaded and I didn't really want to
5:43pluck them before this video because then I knew I would have hated myself
5:45when it actually came to going to get them plucked because I'm supposed to
5:50leave them aren't you
5:51very difficult that is one thing that's actually quite difficult about getting
5:54your brows done
5:55ok so for the eyes i'm going to use this which I have absolutely raved about if
6:00any of you follow my blog
6:01then you'll know that I spoken about this since I think 2010 2011 and it is
6:06not is old or eyes old and its really - really beautiful kind of burnt orange
6:12shimmery gold shades that really make blue eyes stand out and I just go back
6:20to this all the time so I definitely want to use this here and this is one
6:25that I actually use most of the time I'm surprised it's not more dented than this
6:31so I'm going to use the darker shade and i'm just going to pop that kind of from
6:35the middle out
6:43but don't worry this point it doesn't need to be neat hat sponge your eyeball
6:50move and again on the other side
6:57this is already so autumnal finally & colca but all things
7:01great pop a little bit of mac and the light on the inner corner going to use
7:07the same brush because why not
7:17now you want to get a tiny teeny tiny little shader brush and you want to put
7:21a little bit of amber lights just underneath the eye
7:30and kind of bring it into the center just past the center now you're gonna
7:34want a blending brush and I'm going to use a matte shade
7:40this I believe is chocolate brown and i'm going to just pop a little bit of
7:44that in there and I'm going to go in the outer V
8:00we're going to use a slightly fluffier brush this is the Sigma tapered blending
8:04and i'm just going to blend the whole thing
8:11I'm just gonna take a smidgen of slightly darker Matt Brown and I'm going
8:16to go right in the crease and kind of give that a little bit more definition
8:22yeah
8:27vacation is looking to just really blend every autumnal color in your eye shadow
8:32palette until it looks ok I'm going to then put a little bit of the not quite
8:38as dark brown to this one just in the outer part underneath the bottom lash
8:43line
8:49this kind of brings the whole thing in together now next thing I'm going to do
8:52is my brows and where this is kind of strange order of doing my eye makeup but
8:56I kind of feel like once I have the eyeshadow on and then I put my brows on
9:00it doesn't look scary just going to use that same brown and a little angled
9:05brush and I kind of just do like really small hair like strikes
9:21this looks so weird i always find where you just had your brows done it takes
9:25like no time at all to your brows
9:27however when you need to get them done it takes a really long time and that is
9:32the issue I'm having right now
9:35ok this looks really weird but my eyebrows are done
9:39next up is a little cat flick and i'm going to use the charlotte tilbury the
9:43feline slick which is amazing
9:46pray to the cat I gods but i actually get this ride
10:20now it's time to scar which I always find makes the most difference
10:23this is the Maybelline lash sensational
10:26it's incredible lots of edibles
10:43ok mascara done is going to put a teeny bit of highlighter and my brow bone
10:47using the little fluffy brush again and I'm going to use macs vanilla
10:52no nylon Mac nylon
10:56now it's time for my favorite bit
11:01the lipstick charlotte tilbury glastonbury will never stop going on
11:05about it
11:20I do you think that if you're not used to wearing a dark lipstick it is really
11:24good to use a lip liner because it is quite a dark color
11:28however I reckon I could probably put that on in the dark because I put it on
11:31so much so I'm kind of used to doing it but if you struggle a little bit with
11:36our colors i would recommend using a point of first or using a lip brush and
11:40kind of just stopping it on your lipstick and then applying it around
11:44your lip line before filling it in with the actual lipstick
11:46ok so this is the finished look it is gold on the eyes and a very tone on the
11:51lips
11:52I absolutely love it it's just basically my autumn makeup look most of you will
11:57know this because in my second Channel videos I'm basically wearing it

12:45thanks so much for watching guys and see you again soon
0:00Hello everybody! Today I'm going to be showing you
0:01how I did this bronzed nude look.
0:04Which I think is perfect for this time of the year
0:07or if you're anything like me
0:09and you can kinda get away with fake tanning your body,
0:12but the minute you try and fake tan your face
0:14everything goes completely wrong.
0:16I always whip out the bronzer around this time of the year,
0:19so I thought it was only right to do a very bronzey look.
0:23So let's get started.
0:25I've already put my serum on and my moisturiser on,
0:29so now I just need to start on me face.
0:32I'm gonna use the NARS Sheer Glow in the shade Mont Blanc
0:36just because I flippin' love this foundation.
0:40Ooh, forgot my foundation brush.
0:43I'm really loving stippling brushes at the moment,
0:47so I'm using the Real Techniques stippling brush.
0:49And I'm just gonna dip it in here.
0:54I really feel like NARS Sheer Glow is that one foundation
0:57I always come back to.
0:59I really love it.
1:03Now I'm gonna use the Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer,
1:06which I really love, you guys know how much I love this.
1:11And I'm just putting that on any like...
1:15random marks.
1:17And I'm gonna pop a little bit of the Collection Lasting Perfection Concealer in Fair
1:23straight under my eyes.
1:28And yes, I put quite a lot of concealer on.
1:31Especially on mornings, where I have woken up and I'm like
1:33"Did I sleep last night? Like what are all these bags about?"
1:36And I'm also using a Real Techniques brush
1:39and this is the setting brush.
1:40I have been really enjoying using this for blending concealer.
1:44It takes a little bit longer than if you where to use your finger
1:47or if you were to use your foundation brush or a sponge.
1:50But I really, really like it and I just feel like it's lasting better throughout the day.
1:54I'm not sure. I'll show you what I mean.
2:08The concealer is now done,
2:09I'm gonna use the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Luminous Light.
2:15And I'm gonna use...
2:19The Sigma Large Powder Brush.
2:24I've already raved about this powder quite a lot,
2:27so I'm not gonna say too much about it.
2:29But I really, really love that it makes your skin look quite glowing.
2:32And for this look I feel like that is a necessity,
2:36so I am loving using that at the moment.
2:39Gonna do a little bit of contouring using
2:42my Anastasia Beverly Hills Contour Palette in Light to Medium.
2:46And I'm gonna use this shade,
2:49which is the sort of middle... I don't know.
2:53Ashy-ish brown.
2:57And I'm also using my Charlotte Tilbury Powder & Sculpt.
3:04Gonna do a little bit under me double chin.
3:12Now, I am going to put a little bit of
3:15the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Potion--
3:18Primer Potion.
3:20And just let that kinda sink in.
3:31There we go.
3:32Okay, and next thing I'm gonna do is bronze.
3:36Now, this is kind of the key part to this
3:39and I feel like so many people get scared of wearing bronzer
3:42and I know it's easy to overdo it, but...
3:45But I just feel like in summer, can you really overdo the bronzer?
3:49I'm using the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Bronzer
3:53in Radiant Bronze Light.
3:54I love things like this.
3:57That have like a little bit of shimmer in them.
3:59I think now is like the best time to be wearing things like this.
4:03Pretty much the rest of the year I wear bronzers that are kind of
4:06matt or have like the tiniest bit of shimmer, but...
4:09For a bronzey look I just think you should go all out
4:13on the bronze.
4:21I feel like the key to all bronzing is to make sure you take it down your neck as well,
4:26because you don't want like a super bronzed face
4:29and then no bronzing on the neck.
4:35Because I'm keeping this look quite bronzey
4:38I don't wanna do too much cheek color, but I am going to put a tiny bit on.
4:42So I'm gonna use the Becca x Jaclyn Hill Champagne...
4:46Champagne Collection Face Palette
4:48in the color Rosé Spritz which is this one.
4:52And I'm literally gonna put the tiniest amount on my cheeks,
4:55because this is super pigmented.
5:01And then using my Real Techniques Fan Brush...
5:06I always grew up throwing these things away,
5:10being like "What do people even use these for?".
5:13I just found them so like confusing, and i was like
5:17"What is this for?"
5:19Um, but recently I've actually been using this one for highlight,
5:22because, I don't know, it just...
5:25works really well.
5:26Because it gives you like a really light touch.
5:29And I'm literally gonna put the smallest amount on,
5:31because as you'll see this highlight is insane
5:33and it's from the same face palette and it's the...
5:38Champagne Pop.
5:39It's insane.
5:49Face is pretty much done,
5:51so the only thing we need to now is the eyes and the eyebrows and the lips.
5:56So... eyes.
5:58I'm gonna use my beloved Too Faced Sweet Peach Palette,
6:01because you guys know how much I love these shades.
6:05Oops, I definitely just stuck a finger in one of them.
6:07And I think they go really, really perfectly well with a bronzey make up look.
6:11The colours I am going to use are: Caramelized first all over the lid.
6:26At this point I'm just kind of packing the colour on,
6:28because we're gonna blend it anyway.
6:31Looks kinda terrifying.
6:33I am going to take the shade Luscious, which is this one.
6:38And I'm gonna go in the inner corner .
6:47Now I'm gonna take a smaller brush
6:50and this is a Clover one again.
6:52And I'm just gonna put a little bit of the Luscious in the inner corners of the eyes.
6:59And then using the same brush I'm gonna go in with Caramelized
7:02and I'm gonna pop that on the, um...
7:04outer half of the bottom lash line.
7:12And then using a Sigma Blending E25
7:17I'm gonna go in with the Charmed, I'm Sure matt brown.
7:26Gonna do me eyebrows.
7:28I'm gonna use these two shades combined, because I've just had them tinted
7:31so they're slightly darker than normal.
7:33The only annoying thing is that I don't know what the shades are.
7:37Oh!
7:38Bare with, bare with...
7:40The slightly darker one is Mystery and this one is Charcoal Brown.
7:43Uh, FYI...
7:44Tint your eyebrows.
7:45It's just the best thing ever, it's so great.
7:49Just makes life so much easier.
7:51Makes your eyebrows so much easier.
7:53Maybe not life. Eyebrows.
7:54I'm just using a MAC 266
7:56to pop that in me brows.
8:06One.
8:07Look at the difference in my eyebrows right now.
8:12I always think eyebrows look so scary
8:16before you've done anything else--
8:18Okay they look quite dark actually. What have I done.
8:20I'm gonna use a little bit of Ready, Set, Brow!
8:23Maybe I should've done my brows first.
8:27Let's just claim some of that powder out.
8:30You know guys...
8:32Sometimes your brow game...
8:34is a lot stronger in terms of colour, not in terms of, you know...
8:39brow game strong.
8:40You know? Do you know what I mean?
8:41You know what I mean.
8:42They're quite dark.
8:43Are they?
8:45I can't figure it out.
8:47I think I need to just put my mascara on and then I can make that decision.
8:50Okay, so mascara...
8:52I'm using the Smashbox
8:55Indecent Exposure.
8:58Which I am obsessed with at the moment,
9:01because it's beautiful and makes your eyelashes beautiful.
9:10If you don't like thick mascaras, you probably won't like this,
9:14but I love thick mascaras.
9:17I love when they're a little bit--
9:19Oh god, I don't love when I drop some on my lower lash line
9:22and it smudges into everything I've already done.
9:25Look at the difference
9:26in my eyelashes right now.
9:28Is this too close?
9:30Most probably.
9:31Slightly verging on clumpy eyelashes are my fave.
9:34And I'm gonna use a little bit of Clinique Bottom Lash Mascara,
9:37because it is the only thing that I can put on my bottom lashes
9:41and it doesn't end up down my face half--
9:43halfway through the day.
9:46I'm holding my breath.
9:49Ooh, come back into focus.
9:52I'm gonna use a little bit of the Benefit High Brow Glow under my eyebrows.
9:56And I'm just gonna draw that on.
10:04Pencils like this after you've had your brows done
10:07are like life lifesavers, because they just look so good.
10:10I'm just gonna blend that a little bit with my finger, just because...
10:14it's quite...
10:17it's quite harsh right now.
10:20Do you know what guys?
10:21After doing my eyes I feel like we could put a little bit more bronzer on.
10:24You know? This is a bronzed look after all.
10:26So I'm gonna go in with a little bit more bronzer.
10:32Bronzed to the hills.
10:34To the heights.
10:35Bronzed...
10:36Really bronzed.
10:38And because this look is really bronzey
10:40and the eyes are really bronzey,
10:42I wanna keep the eyes quite neutral.
10:44So I'm going for a nude.
10:46Lip liner, I'm gonna use...
10:48the Barry M Lip Liner in the colour...17.
10:52Colour 17.
10:57My mirror is really far away from me right now
10:59and I'm just thinking that's probably not the best idea when doing lip liner.
11:06Probably should've put some, um...
11:12I would completely just wear this on it's own.
11:14However, I'm gonna put a little bit of this over the top, which is the
11:18NYX Liquid Suede...
11:21in the colour Sandstorm.
11:24And every time I wear this you guys are like
11:26"What are you wearing on your lips?!"
11:27It's mostly this.
11:37Let's just let that dry.
11:39It dries like a matt and it's so pretty.
11:42Right now it's still quite liquidy.
11:44Okay, so that is the finished look.
11:46I am quite obsessed with this.
11:49I know that for the continuation of summer
11:51I'm gonna be bronzing up.
11:53I just love this bronzer.
11:56I think this is... I mean this is what made the look, to be honest.
12:00And if there was a time where you can overdo the bronzer
12:05it is for sure summertime.
12:07I really hope you guys enjoyed this little tutorial.
12:10If you did, make sure to give the video thumbs up.
12:13And also leave suggestions for any other make up looks
12:16you've either seen me wear or you think I should try...
12:19I hope you've had a really lovely week
12:21and I will see you again very soon.
12:23Bye!
0:00hello everyone today I'm going to talk you through the makeup that I am
0:04currently wearing on a pretty much everyday basis i upload second channel
0:09videos if any of you didn't realize there's a little plug for you and a lot
0:13of you have been asking me in the comments what makeup
0:15I've been wearing so is that I've just applied to thousands of comments telling
0:20you what foundation i'm wearing what this car and wearing
0:23I just thought i would attempt attempt being the key word here to do a tutorial
0:29talking you through the different items that i use on my face and how i use them
0:34and how I put them on just so that those of you who are really interested now no
0:39I am NOT a makeup artist that just has to be thrown out but if i do something
0:44that offends you or my brushes too dirty or I'm not doing something the way that
0:49you would do it
0:50that's okay because we all have our different techniques and we all have our
0:54different ways of doing things
0:56this is just mine i'm not saying that you have to completely copy me or you
1:00have to do everything the same way I'm doing it or even use the exact same
1:02product if you have anything that's similar or you find something that's a
1:06lot cheaper that does just about the same job and looks the same and then
1:11good on you and let me know what it is in the comments i can buy it ok so the
1:15first thing that I did was I put on my moisturizer and my eye cream and now i
1:21am going to do my foundation I'm using the NARS sheer glow in mont blanc which
1:27is very very pale
1:28I'm just gonna put a little bit of that in the back of my hand because i don't
1:31have a pump and apparently they just never have the pump in stock
1:36every time i go and dance i'm going to be using my zoeva 102 silk finished
1:42brush
1:43none of my brushes are clean but and it's just because i use them
1:48I need to watch them though so
1:53yeah
1:57ok foundation done i'm going to put a tiny bit of concealer in the places that
2:01i feel like i need it which is just under my eyes and a little bit of
2:06redness on my nose and anywhere else where patty stop
2:18as you can see i don't really go sparing me on the or concealer consider the
2:22ideas is the little wake me up concealer in number
2:27I don't know ivory
2:30i am going to use the zoeva face shape brush just to blend that in mind just
2:40doctor cut it cut it out the word patch it in with the brush
2:50I look really pale now who could put some color on my face
2:54so I'm going to use my bronzer which at the moment is the estee lauder bronze
3:00goddess bronzer actually it's quite like a ready undertone and it's matt and I've
3:06just been really enjoying that
3:07so i'm going to be using my Mac 109 brush to do that
3:12yeah
3:19and i'm going to take a tiny little bit on this brush which is the so even when
3:22I see how to brush I'm going to take it down my neck a little bit
3:27yeah
3:34now i have a bit more color to my say i am going to do some balagia this is my
3:40favorite at the moment I've been absolutely loving it
3:43I'm really sorry its limited edition if you can find anything that's anywhere
3:47nice and when I do leave it in the comments and suggestions for other
3:50people because it's just too beautiful and also i'm going to want to have this
3:54at some point so i don't really need something to replace it with is the
3:57estee lauder pure color in T's it looks like this
4:01it's absolutely gorgeous it's basically a blush and highlight all in one and i
4:05just got my zoeva one year one to seven bucks sheer cheek I'm just gonna wear
4:13these burly equally
4:22yeah
4:25yeah
4:31I think it makes me look really like to help feel like i don't know i just i
4:35love it

4:40I'm gonna do my eyebrows i'm using the archery by soap & Glory pencil /
4:46felt-tip pens pencils at one end and that's at the other end
4:50I am absolutely freaking loving this
4:54if I cannot find it in my drive that has like a little mini like planet
4:57I really like a felt-tip side family enough which i never thought i would say
5:01that will always be like an eyebrow pencil powder salt person but since I've
5:05been getting my eyebrows done i get them tinted and it just becomes a whole lot
5:09easier to fill in your brows you find that you don't really need to do much
5:12work i just like to meet in the back slightly
5:19this one done makes a whole lot of difference eyebrows did the next thing
5:32I've been doing with my eyes just to be like super quick super simple
5:37if I'm running out the door and going shopping I don't really like to spend
5:41too much time i make up at the moment because I quite like it to look
5:44minimal so i've been using these which rd and by Terry on Bray black star
5:53they're basically eyeshadow crayons and they are amazing i mentioned this way
5:58back in like my November favorites or something when I had all the boys in the
6:03video with me and I just love them i have for now
6:07like someone needs to basically just take me away from the by Terry counter
6:12and the one that i've been really loving is like a really soft baby pink and this
6:16is the frozen corpse one
6:19it's quite light shimmery is really pretty it's just a very nice pink and
6:23that basically just do a wash of this over both eyes and then blend
6:37once I've Smith that on I kind of want to blend it so i'm going to use a weaver
6:42petite crease because i have a petite creases from really weird and I'm just
6:48going to blend and appear basically not too much
7:02yeah
7:03i'm also going to use a much lighter one and this is called a blonde Oh Paul I'm
7:09just going to pop a little bit of that in the corners of my eyes and just under
7:11here
7:13and then going to take this little brush which is so either precise shader and
7:18I'm just gonna you know
7:19blendy blendy
7:24I'm then going to take a color from my mac eyeshadow court and it is mystery
7:29which is a matte dark brown and I'm just going to go in in my lash line at the
7:35top and also underneath my lash line down here slightly and smudge it in
7:42I've been doing this a lot recently instead of eyeliner and I just feel like
7:46it's a lot more natural but it's also a lot less precise because you don't have
7:51to be as careful
7:54so you could say I've gotten I lazy
7:59so now i have done my eyes and I need to now put mascara on the mascara i have
8:04been loving recently is on the floor hang on
8:08so this mascara is the charlotte tilbury full-fat lashes five-star mascara
8:14Carl separation volume length and drama that claims to do a lot of things and i
8:20love it
8:27look at the difference in my eyes right now
8:31that's crazy
8:37scar now done I'm gonna use my teeny tiny little clinic bottom lash mascara
8:43which I totally forgot I had and got quite excited by when I found it which
8:50I'm just going to do two separate my bottom lashes a little that
8:57and then last but not least i am going to finish this off with a lip gloss and
9:04of course it is my gorgeous friend tanya burr lip gloss
9:07this is my current favorite one she has many that i love and not being biased
9:11but I love them and it's the one called chic

0:00everybody firstly I just quite like to ask how you are
0:03because I feel like you guys are always asking me how I am and i would actually
0:06quite like to know how you are so tell me what exciting thing you've done this
0:10week and on a scale of one to ten how good is your mood
0:15swallow I wanted to do something a little bit different this week so you
0:19guys absolutely love when I do my kind of makeup tutorials
0:23I really hate calling them that because let's face it i'm not the best but I'll
0:26give it my best shot and they do always say that
0:29taking part is the part of matter what do you think that's not what I say it's
0:33a taking part that matters right
0:37maybe so although I am NOT a makeup genius like do you love doing these for
0:43you and you're going to be like watching them and so I of course want to make
0:47more and i also really like to ramble as you guys know so i thought i would use
0:51my little bit different kind of like a show and tell
0:54if you will so I have done this makeup look
0:58and I just wanted to kind of run you through the product as i show you how i
1:03do that instead of me kind of rambling and I'm trying to do it which let's be
1:06honest sometimes is a little bit i'm at the makeup look I'm going to be chatting
1:10you through today is this one which i'm just going to call pink
1:15p pinky pink a lot of pink
1:19i have been loving baby pink at the moment I've won this makeup look a few
1:22times and you've all been desperate to see how I did it I try to use a really
1:26good mixture of affordable and slightly more higher-end products just so i know
1:32that it's kind of a good mixture for everybody
1:35however if you do see something that you know there's a more affordable jump for
1:39then let everybody know in the comments or let me know i'd like to know too
1:43so I really hope you into it so let's get started
1:46the first thing that I used on my face was a new foundation that i have
1:50recently discovered because it was sent to my PA rock and it is tart and it's
1:56the rainforests of the sea water foundation
1:59this stuff is so good I really really like it i would say it has a medium to
2:04buildable coverage and it has this really cool kind of dropper and I just
2:11think the packaging is amazing is this gorgeous frosted glass bottle tight as a
2:14brand that I really really recommend they have so many amazing products and I
2:20feel like that price range is actually too bad
2:23the only thing I would say about time is it slightly more difficult to get hold
2:26of
2:26if you are here in the UK but I was super excited to receive this along with
2:31the other things in the rainforests of the CD collection and so far i'm really
2:35loving this foundation
2:36I feel like it goes on really nicely a blend very well and it just lasts three
2:41well throughout the day
2:42I'm not normally one to rave about water-based foundation
2:46I they don't necessarily work for me but this one I'm getting on with really well
2:52and I think I've almost every day for like the past 10 days
2:55so yes really loving that of the moment and the packaging is just beautiful for
3:00my blemishes
3:01they can see that I used was my ever so favorite the urban decay naked skin
3:06concealer
3:07this stuff is slightly more on the pricey side but i find that the coverage
3:11it gives and the way it kind of sinks into your skin without it looking like
3:16you're caking over a blemish
3:18I find it just works really really well it gives a really nice kind of
3:22airbrushed look almost like you know photoshop when you can just like go over
3:27something with color is called the clone tool but don't quote me on that have a
3:30nice way to shop in a real long time
3:32it's kind of like you're doing that you're taking one part of your skin
3:34that's good I like placing it over and it just works really well the only thing
3:39i will say about these is make sure you color match
3:42don't kind of guess on line because the colors I'm very so much and quite a lot
3:47of them are quite orange and time so just make sure you check that before you
3:51buy one put on your face and my eyes I used my favorite concealer of all time
3:56ever ever literally think i purchased about 20 in my lifetime
4:00the collection lasting perfection concealer
4:03this stuff is the perfect shade under my eyes I generally just dab it in kind of
4:08like a triangular shape because I was not blessed with the bright under eye
4:14area
4:15thanks fam so I put a little bit that on and just using my sponge which is what I
4:21used for my foundation and my other concealer
4:24I then blend that in and i just find it gives great coverage
4:29it's so affordable and it lasts all day pretty much
4:33I am one of these people who knows you need to powder in order for your makeup
4:38to last well and look the best it can be for the most amount of time
4:41however I don't like my skin to look really mad I feel like it makes it look
4:47a bit muddy and I find that products to blend as well I find powder the hardest
4:51thing to get right
4:53I've tried so many powders and that are ones i absolutely love most of which are
4:57actually loose powders
4:59but I just find that there's such a fine line between a good amount of powder and
5:05all of a sudden too much powder i have recently been using the AL glass and
5:10being lighting powder in luminous light
5:13I believe this is a powder to use on your face imagine if this was just a
5:17highlighter that I've just been like brushing all over
5:19I'm raise your bid is a powder that you can use but it gives my face much more
5:25of a luminous finish and I really notice the difference in photos and videos
5:30especially that it just makes my complexion appear brighter but also
5:35powder so it also kind of combat the whole kind of oiliness and makeup
5:42movement
5:43if any of you are looking for something that does a similar thing if you feel
5:46that your face kind of goes a bit flat once you put powder on
5:49try this honestly I love it
5:52I don't know why it's taken me so long to try that the next thing I used was
5:56this L'Oreal glam bronze contour kit so you've got the contour on one side and
6:00then you've got a highlighter on the other one of my favorite bronzers a
6:03whole time is actually a l'oreal bronzer which is very similar
6:06our packaging to this but it's just the whole the whole thing
6:09so when I saw this abuse the other day i was like wow I'm going to try this out i
6:12haven't actually used it before today today was the first time I used it but i
6:17really like it's a really nice color it is kind of orange and times if you avoid
6:22that at all costs
6:23this might not be the color for you but I don't mind it because i feel like it
6:27kind of adds a bit more walk to my face it blend really nicely
6:31hopefully it lasts all day on first impressions I was really impressed
6:36the only thing i will say is I didn't use this
6:39the highlighter and I feel like it's very narrow unless you have the world's
6:44skinniest brush I feel like it's going to be a possible to get that separately
6:49to this if you want to do it in one big swipe which i'm not sure i'm brave
6:53enough for and it might work really well but if you're trying to go contour and
6:58highlight separate I feel like this could make life a little bit tricky for
7:01you
7:02for blush i use this which is the revlon racy Rose blush
7:06it's a really gorgeous pink shade kind of like a deep pink actually which I
7:12wasn't so sure would go
7:15I feel like you can overdo the pink so i only put a little bit of this on
7:20but it blend really nicely it looks really pretty it's quite subtle it's not
7:24hugely hugely pigmented but for the price and the actual product I think
7:31it's really really good and worth looking into
7:35it's also not too much more shimmer so if you're after something that literally
7:39just put color on your cheeks
7:40I think this would be perfect for highlights I used my tart skin
7:45twinkle lightning palette which actually came out in the same collection as the
7:49foundation which is rain forests of the sea
7:51the packaging is so beautiful and I mean just look at that
7:56three amazing highlighters have this one which is a bit more in champaign
8:02this one which has a slight more kind of peach undertone and then you have this
8:07one which is a little bit more shimmery and a little bit more pink
8:10I am loving this at the moment i would highly recommend it it is beautiful
8:15actually reaching for this over my hourglass ambient lighting palette which
8:21is saying something
8:23i also really like it it's called skin wrinkle oh what's that on your cheek
8:27bone all just a bit skin twinkle like all highlighted sheets just be called
8:31skin twin clothes for do my eyeshadow I of course applied and eyeshadow primer
8:35this is the Urban Decay anti-aging eye shadow primer potion love this
8:40this is lasted me so long to be honest I probably should buy a new one because
8:43i'm not too sure how long these things last before they don't work to the best
8:48of their abilities basically kind of foolproof
8:50pull over on your finger rub it into your eye and I just find my eyeshadow
8:55last well blends well and looks better
8:59next thing I did was my eyebrows now i know i'm in need of a threading session
9:04not myself
9:06I let someone else do it so I did have a few little stray hairs and I also find
9:09it slightly more difficult to fill my brows in after I've had my brows up a
9:13couple of weeks after I've had my brows done because I get them tinted tip
9:17always get your brows tinted
9:19holy crap it makes life so much easier if you've never done it before try it
9:22I went to Space NK recently I had a little splurge
9:26huh and i was looking in the cabin a quant section because i have a few of
9:30their products and i really like them especially that - I shadows hope they're
9:35amazing
9:35so it's very and i picked up this which is the precision brow pencil because as
9:41you guys know I really love my brow pencils especially when they say
9:44precision because it means they're teeny-tiny and you can kind of replicate
9:48has in your eyebrows and they look more natural basically you twist it and
9:53you've got the little pencil nib and then on the other end which is what
9:58basically sold it to me
9:59is a little lid and a little eyebrow brush
10:03I don't own an eyebrow brush right now I don't quite know what happened there
10:07so I was like okay great this is basically an all-in-one you can brush
10:11through your brows either if you put too much pencil or just to kind of get the
10:15shape right and then use pencil
10:18recently I've been kind of venturing out of my total pages golds and I've been
10:24going for more kind of pinky barry x
10:26I don't really know why i have not done this more I don't know I just thought
10:30maybe they don't go with my eye color but then I thought screw it i'm just
10:32gonna wear it and see what it looks like and I really liked it
10:35I used the easy on the i-17 palette for the main color and it was this one which
10:43doesn't have a name
10:44oh yes it does I apologize
10:47the color i used all over the lid was number seven which is toasted almond
10:52I do you know what this color is really hard to describe it's like her
10:56it's like a dusky pink mixed with a bit of taupe and I really liked it so I
11:01popped that all over the lid these eyeshadows are actually really good
11:06and this is a really affordable palette so if any of you are after something
11:09which has kind of a really good selection of colors and an eye primer
11:15then check that out for the rest of the colors i used to the eyeshadows in this
11:20which is the Too Faced chocolate bon bons palette
11:24can I just say to face make the cutest packaging
11:30I've ever seen I literally love everything to face bring out because
11:33they just make it look so cute and it's free consented
11:38not that anyone's going to sniff your eyelids and go all chocolate scented
11:43eyeshadow but you know it's just a nice little like a treat when you to your
11:47eyeshadow award for cutest packaging for sure
11:51goes to two faced I know it's not everyone's cup of tea but i really like
11:54in the corner of my eye I used this gorgeous shade called sprinkles which is
11:58basically a shimmery baby pink which is normally I would be terrified to use but
12:02i think it works really well with this
12:04I look then
12:05in the crease of my eyes I used the one underneath which is a brown with a hint
12:12of berry tone matte color called bordeaux and I just feel like that gives
12:17the I little bit more definition and i also run that underneath my bottom lash
12:22line and then used satin sheets which is this gorgeous pinky highlight shade
12:27I'm just under my brow bone and in the very corners of my eyes is to brighten
12:31everything up a little bit highly recommend this color and all to face
12:35eyeshadows to be honest they are beautiful
12:37I didn't really want to make this too heavy and do a quid liner cat I so just
12:42to give my top eyelid and my top eyelid to give my top lash line a little bit
12:47more definition i just use the Urban Decay 24-7 glide on pencil
12:51this is actually a duo pencil which is perfect for travel because you've got
12:55black on one side and you've got a really nice matte brown on the other
12:58hand i used the brown just because i find it looks a little bit softer and it
13:03lends out a little easier and it doesn't look so harsh and that is called whiskey
13:09for my mascara i used this which is the Loreal fall / sculpt
13:14so I was said this not too long ago and I used it has this funny little like
13:19crocodile nip
13:20I think I might have put it in a favorite I can't remember I love this
13:24it's quite similar to the Maybelline one that I'm obsessed with but I feel like
13:28this is just super quick
13:31i'm not sure like with a lot of the scar is where you find yourself layering you
13:36don't do that with this
13:37it's like one code and you're pretty much good to go
13:40it says for extreme sculpting effect fibers
13:43it's very thickening and volumizing it doesn't necessarily add a lot of length
13:50but I find that because quite often it goes on the eyelashes at once
13:55it doesn't lift them and I used to just put like one coat of this on
14:00maybe a second just to you know separate the lashes look
14:03bit i will say if you don't like a sort of clumping mascaras i know most people
14:10don't like clumpy mascara but you know what i mean like a lot of people like
14:13that I like that because it's thickening and it's quick and I don't have the time
14:17to have like seven layers of mascara
14:20if you like that you'll love this if you hate that don't go near this because it
14:25is quite a clumpy thickening mascara
14:29however i love it onto my lips so I like my lips with this which is the
14:36colour-pop lippie pencil again slightly difficult to get hold of color pop in
14:41the UK but if you can
14:43the products are so worth it i love all their lip products I'm obsessed with
14:47them and this basically it's just a really lovely creamy lip liner I find
14:51their lip liners are the best lip liner ever
14:54they have the biggest variety of colors you've ever seen in your life and they
14:58just work really really well
15:00lipstick this is the lipstick that I wore a couple of videos back and all of
15:03you were like what is your lipstick but this is it
15:07it's a Smashbox lipstick and it is in the shade
15:10panorama pink and it's just this beautiful
15:13i would say it's like a cross between a Barbie pink and a baby pink
15:18it's somewhere in the middle which is why i think i really like it because i
15:21don't own any other colors like this
15:24in fact my lipstick draw is really lacking on the pink shades so I know
15:28what I'm gonna be doing
15:29whenever I go shopping now is looking at the pink lipstick I really like this
15:32much works lipsticks
15:33normally you guys know I'm much more of a matte lipsticks kind of girl
15:37but this has a really gorgeous moisturizing machine and they feel so
15:44luxurious on the lips
15:45they last really well obviously not as long as it would if it was a matte
15:49lipstick
15:49it gives a really gorgeous healthy look your lips but still have the
15:53pigmentation which i find is a really hard balance to get because normally a
15:58matte lipstick will have the best pigment you've ever seen
16:00and then you'll find that moisturizing lipstick doesn't quite have that same
16:04color payoff but these really do and I love
16:07listen and then just have an option on top if you want to or you don't have to
16:12i decided to just put this or just to show you what i wanted to kind of bring
16:16that the tone of pink down slightly
16:18so I popped on a little bit of lip gloss this is a l'oreal cream lip gloss in 101
16:24girl on top and it's just a really gorgeous kind of Milky baby pink and you
16:30can just add that on top for a bit more machine or just to kind of bring the
16:33color back down slightly
16:35i really like these i like the applicator is really interesting and
16:39kind of glides over your lips I think they've designed it so that it feels
16:43really comfortable to just sit over your lips as your player and they smell
16:48amazing
16:49so that is my pinky makeup look I really hope you guys enjoyed this style of
16:54video as i said before let me know if you want me to do another one
