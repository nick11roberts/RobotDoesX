5:06let's do this I woke up like this
5:09literally I did so I don't make a cute butt like this is reality so all right
5:14so my eyes are already primed
5:16i use mac pro longwear concealer in the shade and w22 prime my eyelids and my
5:21eyes look so tiny today's and so puffy from my allergies I feel like I'm like
5:25the first color that I'm going to go in with is this one right here second down
5:29second from the left
5:30it is a nice warm kind of medium brown so I'm gonna be using that as my
5:34transition shade
5:35I'm taking out on and what it isn't e-40 brush from sigma this is one of my
5:38favorite brushes for blending ought to use it all the time
5:42I'm going to take this color and windshield wiper motions and i'm going
5:44to go all the way from ER corner to the inner corner
5:48you guessed it when I go with my transition color i always like to go
5:51back and forth and a straight line like this to kind of car out the crease and
5:55then once I've done that back and forth and then start going in really small
5:59circular motions back and forth because that will really take any harsh line and
6:04blend it upward into my brain and you can see better
6:08okay here we go Oh give me some now i'm going to go with the shade right here
6:12which is super similar to this one that we just went in with but this one is a
6:15little bit darker so it'll give us just a little bit more dimension and increase
6:18of our I this color reminds me so much of mac texture which is one of my
6:23favorite shades from a collection of my favorite of all time
6:27that's why i love this color so again to be the exact same thing i'm going to put
6:30this color in the crease of my eye and then once we have it carved out back and
6:35forth I will then start blending and circular small motions upward
6:39so now i'm going to go in with this color as well this color the shade and
6:43this one all are very similar which is like light medium and dark
6:46curr these two colors right here are literally such great do so for max
6:51saddle in that texture which are like one of my two favorite I shall I was
6:54ever so I love both of these shades and with all three of these colors i'm
6:58seriously doing the exact same process I'm not switching up anything with all
7:03three of these colors and just want to kind of pile them on top of each other
7:05because it just gives such a smooth blended look when you're done and just
7:09adds a lot of dimension as opposed to just going with one shade and buffing it
7:12out instead you have this palette filled with 28 different colors like why not
7:16use as my son as you can right now i'm going to be going with the shade right
7:20here which is just like the most beautiful chocolaty goodness color I'm
7:24going to pick that up on a what is this morphy and 503
7:28I think this is just one of their new lennie rushes that can happen
7:31I love it going to continuously go back in and pack this on the outer crease and
7:37then work it upward and bring it in with the rest of the colors that we have in
7:41this upper crease area
7:44I love this brush then we'll do is go back with this color blue
7:54I'll go back with the same 44 should i started with you can take any of these
7:57three colors i'm going to take this one that reminds me of not texture and i'm
8:01going to go back in windshield wiper motions because this is a huge key in
8:05blending is just going over things especially once you've added dark shades
8:09going back in with a little bit of a lighter shade back and forth just to
8:13make sure that all of that is blended together and so we have no seems ok so
8:18now i'm going to go in with my favorite color in the palette and as this bad boy
8:22right here
8:22so taking that on this brush i'm just going to put it all over my entire lid
8:27and i am giving myself a lot of fallout right now and what I mean by that is i'm
8:33allowing a lot of shadow fall on my cheeks which i'm ok with I could go in
8:37with less product and i want to
8:39happen but I don't care if I'm not wearing foundation or anything yet so
8:42I'm just going to the generous amount of products and packing this on and then
8:46I'll clean up that under eye area in a minute
8:48what I will also do with my cotton rounds when I'm cleaning my under eyes
8:51I'll take it off fold them in half like this but we have a a line right here and
8:55then I will take back and I will follow up word and that will sharpen up that I
9:00look that we have going on it so i will just again take this folded and just go
9:04upward and then it will sharpen up that eyeshadow like so now to finish off the
9:10top one of our i am going to put a coat of mascara on my eyelashes and mascara
9:15will do for this because we're not going to make it look pretty we're trying to
9:19darken them so we can put false lashes on
9:22oh my goodness Georgie you can totally go in and apply false lashes right now
9:26but I'm just not wanting to apply false lashes yes I'm going to wash my face and
9:30then I will come back to my lashes towards the end
9:33I'm going to prime my face using Smashbox photo finish primer water which
9:36i've been loving recently so i'm going directly based on this i'm going to try
9:43the foundation okay i have not used this yet this is the new nars is called all
9:48day luminous weightless foundation gonna test this out how I like it
9:53me and bring you a little bit for this because you going to be all of my growth
9:56my foundation
9:58my hair's look so good today you guys going to use a Sigma f80 to apply the
10:06foundation and I know nothing about this foundation yet so I'm just going to see
10:10how it wears on my face and yes I know it looks like I'm painting on jaundice
10:14but look understand me
10:17i am not matching my foundation to my face if I did it would not look good i
10:21can promise you I match my foundation to my neck and a lot of people make
10:25comments about my foundation being too yellow but listen this is the call of my
10:28neck is so I'm going to match my neck to my face and when it all comes together
10:32it looks ok
10:34I've been excited to try this because it has the word luminous in it
10:39in the fact that is long wearing I'm looking forward to seeing how this
10:43where's throughout the day
10:50I'm not going to set my under eye area i'm going to use anastacio banana and
10:55mac pro emphasize and i'm going to make the mix those two together
10:59I cannot talk today i got up really early and I can talk a lot of sleep so
11:03just like don't want me as i set my under eye area with this highlighting
11:06powder i like to go up towards my temple because this will just give more they
11:10lifted appearance to the base
11:12I'm going to my under eye area now because I cannot stand seeing myself
11:15with like all the shadow of the top of my list of my under-eye totally like
11:19first I want to go ahead with a pencil brush just like this and i'm going to go
11:23in with really any of these three brown shade that we would initially I want to
11:26take this one right here i'm going to take this and go all along the lower
11:31lash line and because this is a very blown out
11:34rounded smokey eye I really am NOT going to focus on making this too perfect
11:39ok so now i'm going to take the e 15 from sigma the flax fibre brush I'm
11:43going to go back in with this chocolaty shade so everything even the top line
11:46we're not meeting on the bottom lid
11:48I'm going to do this color I'm going to press it really tight along my lower
11:51lash line
11:59I'm going to go back and blend out afterwards of course because every time
12:03i go of the dark shade have to go back and let it out
12:06way to go in with black eye kohl and this is the RNC in monster black
12:11eyeliner i mention this liner many times before is my favorite black eyeliner
12:14ever is so creamy and rich in pigment it's amazing
12:19so I'm going to line my entire water line top and bottom
12:27I was going to let that black I pulled just kind of sit there for a minute and
12:33i'm going to go in and do my eyebrows the way I've been filling in my brows
12:36recently as i start in the inner corner and I make a dark line all in the bottom
12:41part of my brow and then I just kind of flick upward and then that is it
12:45I haven't been doing much to the top of the ground I just start at the bottom
12:48and click upward and then that's all i've been going for a little bit more of
12:53a natural brow recently not natural whatsoever but just not as bold and used
12:59to fill the man now i'm going to be highlighting my brow bone and the inner
13:02corner of my eye and I'm going to be using this shade right here
13:05very first you the palate we're going to do is I'm going to take that color i'm
13:08just going to put it at the high point of the brow bone right here
13:12ok so now i'm going to apply false lashes i'm going to be using this brand
13:18I got in the mail and I don't have pronounced it crown
13:21milady I'm not quite sure i will sit down below course my description bar and
13:26they look like this and they are full and they're fluffy and their the
13:30luminous
13:30this is really going to give us a big extra on top lid
13:34I'm sorry but I just can't talk about applying false lashes like it just does
13:38not work
13:38this is one awkward by doing talk throughs because there's some things
13:41that I do that I can't talk through like applying my lashes I cannot talk about
13:47an appointment
13:47lashes I cannot talk when I'm doing eyeliner i do certain things I cannot
13:50open my mouth and I'm doing it because it's just like it throws me off
13:54I personally think that it's like a must to put mascara on your lashes look like
13:58this because we have such dark volume eyelashes on our top lid I really kind
14:02of want to match that replicated on the lower lash line as well
14:05otherwise your eyes , kind of squint easy now i'm going to contour my cheeks
14:08and i'm going to be using the Kat Von D shade light palette and I'm going to go
14:12in this middle color right here and i'm also using the brush that she sells for
14:17this kit as well i'm going to be using the contour and the brush and go in with
14:22that shape
14:32ok so this foundation is not working for me like at all
14:36it is sitting on top of my skin do you see how blotchy
14:40everything is it can't be this much work it because i have been loving this
14:45contour kit
14:46I don't know what to do to make this look better
14:52i'm going to apply blush i'm going to be using Mac margin which is when my kicker
14:56blushes ever
14:58I'm just going to buy that the apples of the cheeks and blend it backward then
15:06i'm going to highlight my cheekbones and i'm going to be kicking it old school
15:10with married women either by the ball i haven't used in so long I thought my
15:14baby today I wasn't why I love you
15:17what I'm going to go in and highlight the tops of my cheekbones with this for
15:26my lips I'm going to use my favorite nude lip combination ever which is the
15:29butter cream lipstick that i created with dr cosmetics all
15:33i just opened up a brand-new two bandits excel freshly yes
15:46i'm going to go over that make sure our cosmetics shimmer of hope
15:49lip gloss I'm just going to set this with urban occasion makeup setting spray
15:59because God knows we need it
16:03so we are all finished and this is the completed look right here and I honestly
16:11just have to talk about this because typically I would not mention this
16:15because i like to only talk about the positive here on my channel but because
16:18i tried this foundation on camera I feel like I'm just kind of obligated to give
16:22up my opinion and I'm just gonna be honest I'm really disappointed and hope
16:27is the point is foundation i think that makes sense
16:30I was so excited to try this because it says right here in the title of it said
16:34weightless aluminous long wearing foundation so I was like yes it is not
16:39making my skin luminous it honestly feels very dry out my skin
16:42it's cleaning and settling in every single little teeny tiny fine line
16:46I want to get up close in the mirror my skin actually looks kind of old it looks
16:51like i've never seen it before so I don't know and then when I went in with
16:54the power to contour this foundation look like grabbed onto the powder
16:59contour and i can not let you out so I feel a very blocky especially right here
17:04like I'm going to try to like it though i am going to try to mix it with oil and
17:08cream contour instead and maybe if i use it with creams maybe I like it better so
17:12we'll see
17:12well let me know how you guys do about this foundation in the comments down
17:15below if you try to I would love to know maybe those of you with oil your skin
17:18prefer it better because i am tried that could be a reason why it's cleaning so
17:22much to my skin and like everything on
17:24so let me know let me know if you guys have any tips or people like they're not
17:27and i will wear this for the rest of the day and in my opinion changes on I by
17:31the time of this video I will
17:32I'll put it down in the description bar i'll let you know if for some reason it
17:35starts looking like a beautiful of an hour from now i'll let you know
17:39so that's it thank you so much for watching this video i love you guys and
17:43I'll see you soon
0:25hey guys great things from my home to yours and come to my first holiday
0:31makeup to market oh I'll jokes aside i am so excited to be coming this video
0:35because i have not done a makeup tutorial like a fun one and quite a
0:41while so it's it was fun sitting down today coming to look for you and thank
0:44you so much to everyone who left me comments and tweeted me and gave me
0:48inspiration for this makeup tutorial i have seen it so many great suggestions
0:52for making books i am officially in the holiday spirit
0:55actually that's a total lie rewind not a holiday spirit
0:59but i'm in the makeup holiday look spirit you know what I mean
1:03still not ready to put the tree but I'm ready to beat my face and a lot of
1:09people were actually requesting warm smoky eyes like cranberry smokey eyes
1:12and or smoky eyes and incorporating ready now like you just come to mama
1:17like like a fiend like needs her fix when it comes to those warm smoky eyes
1:20but i actually saw one comment that asked for a olive green and gold smokey
1:26eye and it had like a couple hundred thumbs up and if i don't know if that
1:29home and just spoke to me and I was like yes I don't know if I've done a golden
1:34like an olive green sake I have it's definitely been a long time so I thought
1:38it was time to do one
1:39all green is one of my favorite colors like we're in clothing i absolutely love
1:43it especially like a dark dark forest green love it don't ask why are all my
1:47style is kind of weird can you hear my channel you'll get used to it
1:50promise and he fires in no time takes a minute to get used to me but we'll get
1:53there anyways
1:54all babbling inside this is the look that I came up with thank you so much
1:58for the suggestions you guys gave me because it's because of you that I come
2:00up with this look and I just absolutely love it
2:03I wanted to make it smoky bags and I want to make it like level 10 smoky
2:06because I feel like
2:07thanksgiving in the time to be drag queen status for me personally and you
2:11know that that's like a big thing is not always all about my Queens but
2:14Thanksgiving even though I want to do a smokey eye i like to keep it like a
2:17little bit more fresh than I would for something that New Year's e or even
2:22Christmas i did you can be an open top and glittery and fun but for
2:25thanksgiving it's like I'm spend the day with my family i'm eating the food i'm
2:28drinking good wine and so even though i wanted to do a smokey eye i did put a
2:33cream eyeliner on my waterline because I didn't want my eyes to look like too
2:38small to close in to smokey so if you're ever wondering why would apply a cream
2:44liner to your lower water line at the post leading it just completely blank
2:47it's because it will open up the eyes to make them look much more fresh awake and
2:51why
2:51so if you have small eyes to begin with it's a great tip to always put cream
2:55liner in there and will really make your eyes pop and so whenever I did the dark
2:59smoky eye and I want to really make sure that you can still see my eyeballs and
3:03not just the colors on my lid
3:05I will line my waterline I have a hard time talking to you Madeline Madeline I
3:09will win that will hold you going
3:12I'm done ok it's been a long day thank you so much for watching and stick
3:16around me

3:30to subscribe if you want to see any upcoming festive holiday look so thanks
3:35for watching guys I'll see you soon bye
3:39ok so today I'm going to be starting with my face is personal preference you
3:44can start with the skin eyes whatever you're comfortable with
3:46but today i want to start with my skin so i'm going to go in with the marc
3:50jacobs undercover coconut primer I really been loving this recently and
3:54then for foundation and concealer you're going to see the same routine that I've
3:57done in the past two videos because of the fact that i am moving to a new
4:01filming space right now my entire makeup collection is over there and I've been
4:05organizing it so i only have like the basic everyday essentials when it comes
4:09to my skin at my house right now so that's why you're seeing the exact same
4:13routine as the past two videos so i am mixing d cogiendo aqua foundation with
4:18the mac moisture SPF 15 5
4:20station and then blending them together i'm going to be applying it with a tart
4:25face kabuki brush and then for my concealer i am using the of course
4:30urban decay weightless naked concealers and my favorite concealer ever and i
4:34actually
4:35oh my gosh using my Chicago accent come out I said he actually
4:38well anyways I actually ran out of my color in the middle of this video and
4:44that's why you see me using that lighter shade
4:46I am typically light/medium neutral and I ran out of it so you saw me just go in
4:51with the streetlight one I usually use that one to highlight so i put that on
4:55the forehead and the chin as well to balance out the under eye area if I
4:59apply a light considered to the under eye area i always want to even out by
5:02applying to the forehead and the chin as well to make it look a little bit more
5:05natural
5:06so now i'm just going to be setting my under eye area i am using the Anasazi of
5:10Beverly Hills banana powder and i'm going to lightly dust that in the entire
5:14under eye area so that nothing creases and then i'm going to be going in with
5:18one of my favorite eye shadows of all time and this is my mac and it's called
5:21an interrupted it is a pro longwear eyeshadow and i'm applying it with a
5:26more fee for 41 brush and just dustiness in my entire crease area i'm really
5:31going to hula hoop the entire upper lid of the eye
5:34all the way from inner corner to outer corner since we're going to be applying
5:36dark shades on both inner and outer corner today I want to make sure that we
5:40start by putting a nice color in that crease and blending upward as you can
5:44see this is not blending out perfectly it's a little choppy in the crease area
5:49which I was not happy with
5:51I want my crease to be a very blended I don't want any harsh lines I want
5:55nothing to be choppy so I did decide to go in with a little bit of makeup geek
5:58desert sands
6:00this is basically like an interrupted little sister it's very similar to the
6:05color it's just a little bit lighter and shape so I just grabbed that color and
6:08then i went over top of it and as you can see it begins to blend out much
6:12smoother if you ever have an issue with an eyeshadow not blending out it's
6:15always a great idea to grab just one shade lighter of the similar shade and
6:19go over it and then that will help blend out any harsh lines
6:22now i'm going to be going in with dirty martini eye shadow again by makeup geek
6:27I love this eyeshadow so much it is such a beautiful olive green color I could
6:31just throw this all over my lid and put on
6:33something liner and be satisfied so I'm now going in with the morphe and 443
6:38brush this is one of my favorite blending brushes but as I got the inner
6:42corner of the eye I realized it was a little too fat for what I wanted to do
6:46you could make it work but because i had this brush i decided to go in with this
6:50one instead
6:51and this is the Sigma e45 it's just a much more small precision blending brush
6:56and it just fit that in her corner way better
6:58so again on the outer corner of the eye i will begin to pack that and kind of
7:02blend it upwards but more than anything we're just concentrating on really
7:05packing on that color so that it's nice and rich and then kind of blending it
7:09into the socket of the crease and then as we move forward I will trade out that
7:13morphe brush for the Sigma e45 to make sure that I get that color nice and
7:18precise on the inner corner
7:19you could use a q-tip for this and then you could blend it out with like the
7:22morphe blending brush
7:23you don't need to use both brushes but because i have them both
7:27I wanted to use them both because it made it easiest for me so now I'm
7:30grabbing that original brush and I'm going back in with mac on interrupted
7:33and i'm going to put that in the crease because we are working with this matt
7:37all of green we don't want it to get muddy and dirty looking so we're going
7:40to make sure that we continue to go back in with that original shade to keep that
7:44crease looking nice and warm and blend it out because we don't want to bring
7:48that all of green up too high
7:50so now we're going to go in with an even darker green and this is called
7:53enchanted forest
7:55oh my gosh this color is so gorgeous it's just a much darker version of the
8:01original all agree that we went with so using that same Sigma e45 I'm going to
8:05pack that mainly on the outer corner you can put on the inner corner if you want
8:09as well but i really wanted to concentrate on the outer corner and then
8:12again i will go in with a little bit more of an interrupted on the brush and
8:16blend that out we really want to keep the Greens low because if you bring them
8:19up too high on the lid
8:21that's when it can start to look like a little bit like a bruise and we know
8:24that a bruised is not cute on anybody
8:26so now we are going to be going in with a foiled eyeshadow by makeup geek and
8:29this is in the shade gesture and i have recently fallen in love with this color
8:34and it is a really beautiful olive green with some gold reflex and it and so I am
8:39using a mac 242 brush to apply this is a synthetic flat brush so any synthetic
8:44flat brush will work for this
8:45I'm going to focus his color mainly on the center of the lid and then blend it
8:49out to the sides and I'm initially going in with this drive i will spritz my
8:53brush and a moment with some mac fix+ if you don't have to explain you can use
8:57eye drops and that will work pretty much just the same
8:59i'm going to make sure I really focus that wet brush right on the center of
9:02the lid to get a really nice metallic sheen
9:05this is a great trick if you want to make your eyes look bigger and rounder
9:07so if you have small eyes
9:10this will be a great tip for you with any shadows any colors to really make
9:14sure you concentrate the color in the center of the eye and then I was taking
9:17a little bit more of that initial olive green and popping in the inner corner
9:20because I felt like gesture was kind of overpowering it and I didn't want to
9:24lose that inner corner depth darkness that we had
9:27now i'm going to fill in my brows basic we've seen this a million times before
9:31and I actually ran out of my color and the Anasazi a brow is right as i went to
9:36apply it and you know that moment we were just like no my brows shut a quick
9:41tier and move on
9:42so i'm actually using a color from my back stock that is not my right shade
9:46but we're just going to see past that right
9:48we can pass it was the look is done it's fine looks a little weird now but it'll
9:51be fine
9:52so I am using Mac nylon as my brow highlight today because this is my
9:56favorite brow highlight ever as like a nice yellow sheen to it and it is frosty
10:01as can be so at last you forever because the tiniest bit goes such a long way I'm
10:06going to put that right on the top of the brow bone of blend out a little bit
10:09we're going to move on to the lower lash line
10:11so I'm going initially with enchanted forest which is that super super dark
10:15green
10:15i'm going to apply that only on the outer half of the eye and now i'm going
10:19to do is I'm going to go in with the lighter green which is dirty martini and
10:23i'm going to put that on the inner half of my eye so it's almost like an ombre
10:27effect and we have the darker color and the outer corner because we did the same
10:30thing on the upper lid
10:31we put a chance of force that dark green on the outer and we left the inner
10:35corner with just dirty martini so I kind of wanted to have that same effects of
10:39kind of an ombre under eye and then using a pencil brush I'm going to grab a
10:43little bit of that mac and interrupted and just begin to blend it out because I
10:46never want harsh lines on the under eye area i always wanted to have the same
10:50effect as the upper lid so I like to make sure that it's really nice and
10:53smoky and blown out
10:55that's why we go in with a pencil brush and
10:56better color now i'm going to go in with the mac chromatographic pencil and NC 15
11:01/ nw20 which is just an amazing cream liner and it doesn't bother my eyes my
11:06eyes are very sensitive
11:07it's going to line my waterline to really make my eyes stand out especially
11:11since i have blue / green eyes
11:13my eye color can easily get lost with this makeup look so this trip
11:17this trick will make my eye color kind of stand out and not get lost with all
11:20the other green tones and I'm just popping a little bit of nylon highlight
11:24on the inner corner as well to match the brow bone because the interop highlight
11:28is something i can't skip and then i'm going to go in with the Laurier laurier
11:31laura mercier translucent setting powder and i'm going to be using an e3 brush
11:37from morphe just to dust this over my entire face this is a trick that I do to
11:42make my bronzer on my contour my blush and highlight just go on very very
11:46smooth so it's not patchy at all
11:49then I'm going to go in with all my gosh you guys these lashes these are the new
11:52lashes by the Lord lashes and they're sold exclusively at sephora and I
11:56actually think they're launching today but they sent them to me early and this
12:00is the style fluff in wispy a whole my gosh they are probably one of my face
12:06actually all my favorite lashes I've ever used before so i'll try to find it
12:10and link it down below for you guys if they are available in a very dramatic
12:13but they are amazing and I'm going to cut my lower lashes with some mascara i
12:18use mac extended play lash because my favorite lower lash mascara along with
12:23the room i lash accelerator and then i'm going to bronze my face using a bobby
12:27brown bronzer I believe this is a golden one golden light one maybe
12:32and i am using one of my favorite contour brushes at the moment this is
12:35the morphe 523 brush
12:37I don't know what was technically made for but i've been using it for contour i
12:40absolutely love it because it gives a really easy kind of soft contour much
12:43softer than like the NARS eat a brush which I love as well but this one I just
12:47feel like a softer and easier and not as harsh and I don't know I go through
12:52moments where I want really harsh contours and softer ones
12:55speaking of a harsh contour i'm going to take just a little bit of that laura
12:58mercier translucent powder and i'm going to use a really intense angled brush
13:02from morphe this is the 459
13:05I'm gonna let that sit there for a few minutes
13:07i'm going to just dust it off and i have course and setting my brows using
13:11anastacio clear brow gel AKA browse super glue
13:15more like gorilla glue because this stuff does not move and then i'm going
13:18to go in with a blush from the morphine 9b palette i still love this palette
13:22guys it's so good i'm going to use this blush this coral and top right corner
13:27it has a little bit of Sheen in it but it's not sparkly or glittery i'm going
13:31to apply that to the apples of the cheeks and i'm going to really bring it
13:35backward towards the cheekbones recently I've been into applying blush a little
13:38bit further back
13:39I feel like it pulls the face back a little bit more than putting it just on
13:42the apples of the cheeks
13:44I'm thinking about doing an in-depth video about blush contour baking
13:47highlight so let me know if you guys want to see that video and i'll be happy
13:49to do it for you and i'm going to just dust off that bake that we had sitting
13:54there that sounds so funny oh my gosh help me and then i'm going to apply
13:57champagne pop to my cheekbones using a morphy m5a1 brush
14:01I get asked all the time of my favorite brushes for highlight and it's
14:04hands-down the m500 one
14:05I absolutely love it i've been using it for months and it is my fav and i am
14:10going over with a second highlight because I'm just feeling you know
14:13so I'll see today i'm gonna pop some on my cupid bow and then I'm going to take
14:17a little bit of that same bronzer used to contour and just shadow my lower lip
14:21just to give a little bit more of a lower fuller lip effects even though my
14:25top lip needs the fullness let's get real about my bottom but let's move on
14:28for lipstick i'm going to be using house of dollars pretty MF
14:32and as you can see it's like a really really light orange kind of cream
14:35sinkhole and I don't love the way this looks on my skin tone personally maybe
14:39I'm just not used to seeing myself in it but i wanted to go over to kind of
14:42manipulate the color a little bit so I'm going to go in with a NYX butter gloss
14:46this is an oldie but a goodie and the shade maple blondie
14:49and i feel like these two colors mixed together are just like my dream come
14:53true for a Thanksgiving lip I just think it looks like a creamsicle creamy
14:58pumpkin pie i just love the shade that these to make together and it's nice and
15:03glossy and i just love a glossy lip
15:05so after we have that we're just going to set everything by using Urban Decay
15:09to makeup setting spray
15:10we use any spray you want or you can just be balls do not use any setting
15:13spray all mad respect to you and that's the end so i hope you guys enjoy
15:18happy thanksgiving from my family to yours
15:20love you guys so much and I'll see you soon
0:00hey guys so for today's video this is the most random video that i have been a
0:04really long time
0:05i'm going to be doing a first impressions video on the new Carly
0:09cosmetics cumshot oh I catch that was very clever up because shadow bronze
0:16eyeshadow palette
0:17this is so random and unexpected I was not planning on doing this I've actually
0:21had such a busy day and it is currently eight almost a 38-28 right now and i
0:27decided to take a quick body shower and run over here and from this video for
0:31you guys because I received this package in the mail today this was sent to me
0:35from Kylie cosmetics just so you guys know i received this package in the mail
0:38and I jumped on snapchat and show you guys some my finger swatches and showed
0:42you the packaging and the palate all that jazz
0:44and i asked you guys if you would like to see me uses in a video or do a first
0:48impression
0:48I'm not kidding I have so many snaps requesting it that my snap literally
0:53froze and shut down
0:54I went to Twitter when I swear that we're coming in so fast I could barely
0:58read them just from people asking to do a first impression and say thank you
1:01because i mentioned recently that I've just been kind of a rut
1:05I haven't been feeling inspired by am taking action to make changes in areas
1:08so that i can help get myself out of that but honestly you guys just seeing
1:12you so excited over an eyeshadow palette has really just made me so happy and you
1:16guys can just kind of like relive my excitement right now for makeup and
1:20that's why I'm here right now i am just like so happy to be doing this right now
1:24so appreciative and thankful for you guys and your excitement for makeup in
1:27general so I'm just happy to be here
1:30the first thing I want to say about this though is the same thing is on snapchat
1:32and on Twitter a couple of nights ago is the packaging itself slave my soul like
1:38when I saw Kylie's snapchat of this
1:40I didn't even care what was inside this box when I saw this Elvis up
1:43Oh God can you have to buy open up and like all shattered
1:46I would die I just think it is so cool and different
1:50can we talk about this like you talk about those this comes
1:54whatever you order the palate this comes in there with a little note on the back
1:58and I like I can't so this is what the palette itself looks like right here you
2:02can kind of get an idea for the side it's like a very small and compact
2:05carboard very extremely lightweight and on the back it has the shades right
2:10there it has her signature
2:11I think this is like the coolest concept right here it's like so simple but yeah
2:16it's like a very modern and edgy
2:18come on this is like of course we all saw this we were all like yes perfect I
2:23have watched this one this one this one this one these maps shades right here on
2:27my hand i showed you guys on snapchat
2:29I will say the swatches are very very promising but again that's just a finger
2:33swatch so we will see how it actually goes on the eyes
2:36I'm going to be completely and totally honest in this video I have absolutely
2:39no reason to lie to you guys I never have and I never will the data i start
2:42lying to you guys for any reason is the day that my mom will bend me over her
2:44knee and spank me and shut my channel down i will be totally honest with you
2:48guys about this as I always have been as I was honest about her liquid lipsticks
2:51when I first came out so i gotta put that disclaimer out there are no one's
2:54paying me I did receive these this palette for free from Kylie cosmetics
2:58and just got in today i am doing this video by request and that's all i have
3:01to say let's get started
3:03I don't have already mentioned but I do have my entire face a foundation
3:06concealer and powder so my base is already completely done
3:10we're going to go ahead and jump right into the eyes and the first cause i'm
3:13going to pick up is this one right here
3:14a warm medium matte brown I would compare this to something along the
3:18lines of like back saddle
3:20I'm going to be up on a fluffy natural hair brush
3:23guys I'm like anxious and excited to see how these apply and then just go ahead
3:32and put this right in the crease
3:35oh my gosh so far so good you guys
3:39I'm liking or what I am shading and it's even more so you can really see what I'm
3:46doing
3:47oh don't be scared now that I have this product on the brush I'm going to bring
3:51it all the way in to the inner corner because i am going to cover my entire
3:55lid with product today so I'll just lightly feather in their applying just
4:02like any other shadow that I like applies like it's applying similar to
4:07make a big shadow it's applying similar to Mac shadow to have to say on a
4:12different note I feel like
4:13back shadows have kind of gone down recently like it's not just need his
4:17I've start using more and more brands like my standards have gone higher but I
4:20feel like Max shadows used to be better especially the shimmers I don't know why
4:26but anyways
4:27not important ok so now i'm going to pick up this shade right above it which
4:31is a definitely a little bit more of a cool tone have a little more of a great
4:35undertone in it i'm gonna be using the exact same brush and this is the more
4:38feet and 4 4 1 by the way I'm going to go right over top of that now there's a
4:43little bit higher up in the crease but right over top of it
4:46this color is applying beautifully
4:51I mean since the first one apply beautifully i'm sure all the mounts will
4:55but you never know because sometimes in some pallets there's a lot of
4:58inconsistency like one that would be gorgeous and then that's one right next
5:01to it won't like blend you know I'm saying
5:04all right now I'm going to pick up the middle shade oh it is so pretty and that
5:08is in the shade
5:09sit trying side trying to trying likes tron tron so trying
5:14oh god I'm like an idiot going to take like a little less amount of it and I'm
5:19just basically going to like take my brush and go like this and just like dab
5:23a little bit of it down a little bit and it just that I haven't a little amount
5:28of products into my brush and then i'm going to very lightly with a more light
5:32hand go over that whole area just to give it that warmth and brightness in an
5:38orange shadow does
5:39oh yes Kylie I'm a I'm a little impressed not gonna lie
5:50I'm going to pick up a smaller blending brush it basically looks the exact same
5:54time as any to a bit smaller and this is the more p.m. 4 3 3 i'm going to go back
5:59and with that original color right here with and I'm just going to put a little
6:02bit on the brush and I'm not just going to press this kind of on my lid just
6:06like a light sweep to get that color
6:10I want us to basically be a matte look honestly you guys the shadows are
6:19blending and so well I mean you can see it on camera
6:23you know like you can't fake it you can see how well they're blending they're
6:27not choppy they're not strike either . patchy really impressed right now
6:32now i'm going to grab the shadow all the way down here and this is opposite Ian
6:37ok I'll come all these names for things i have no idea how to pronounce what
6:40time you go back to school and this is a really pretty like medium tone very warm
6:46rich reddish-brown reminds me of like a mac swiss chocolate
6:50so this one as I swirl my brush in this one it did have more pickup then the
6:53others right here but i will say i know just from other stuff
6:58um I'm working on that Reds are typically like that if you ever swatch a
7:02shadow that has a lot of red pigment in it and it kicks up a ton of shadow
7:06it's really really tricky to develop a red undertone um I shadows so it does
7:10have a lot of take back compared to the other one's gonna go ahead and put this
7:13out here and this has a nice pigment - I'm going to get a little bit more
7:20I don't fall out yeah this has a really nice pigment for a reddish shadow
7:27because again it's really hard to get good at pigmentation when you're working
7:32with red shades i know a lot of times and pallets i'll be so excited about the
7:36red color like the cranberry color and then when you actually go to use it
7:40it was like actually no pigment and it's just very tricky to develop red will say
7:45this one is not applying as easily and the other the others were so
7:51like worry free and so easy this one I'm having to kind of press it in a little
7:55bit more but again that's probably because of the red
7:59it has a little bit more fallout but still this is nothing I would like
8:04complain about this is just very standard to me you know this is the same
8:08as any other eye shadow brand
8:09so now for this part i am going to just bake my under-eye really quick i'm going
8:15to go in with the darker shades and I just don't want like any of it to fall
8:18out like the dark round the black to fall out and like mess up my foundation
8:22so I'm going to grab some translucent powder and a damp Beauty sponges if you
8:27do your foundation first and then you want to go in with dark shadows and
8:33you're scared that you're going to get all of your face this is just a way to
8:35make sure that you do not ruin your concealer and foundation because you can
8:39just sweep all the products away and you're good to go I mean you look a
8:43little bit like a freak while you're doing it but whatever
8:46alright so now i'm going to grab the middle shadow on the bottom and this is
8:49in the shade
8:50bronze aight and this again is Matt so far we have only worked with the matte
8:54shades and a brush I want to use for this I'm going to stick with the same
8:59exact Russia I've been using and I'm going to pack this on
9:03oh this is nice pigment i'm going to pass on just a tiny bit right on the
9:09lash line area and then just ever so slightly put any outer corner of my eye
9:15I don't want this to be too intense i'm going to keep it kind of light for this
9:20part you're not going to do you take just a small angle brush like this one
9:24right here going to dip in a translucent powder and i'm going to carve out
9:30I don't know if you guys ever seen you this before but this is a great trick if
9:36you want like a slanted katish type
9:38I but you don't want to use tape or you have on foundation already i'm just
9:43going to stamp it on there just like this and then
9:48and it will make it so that we wipe it away you have just like any media cat
9:51eye
9:58I'm going to go back and I'm going to grab a little bit of these two shades
10:01and mix them together a little bit of that warm brown and that one tiny amount
10:07on my brush not too much i'm going to blend out this harsh line right here on
10:11the edge just with tiny little wiggling motions
10:16now as you can see i'm slightly getting rid of my translucent powder that's okay
10:25you have to worry about that you can go back and grab a little bit more of it
10:29and just put it right over top that line and let it sit and it will just continue
10:33to erase anything that you bring down there right now I'm going to grab a
10:37pencil brush any pencil brush will do
10:40and then I'm going to go in with the black shade right here and this one
10:44looks like it's going to be super black
10:47I'm going to take this and I'm going to run it right along my lash line
11:00I am just dipping my brush like one dab into the black because i don't want to
11:05get tons and tons of fallout so when I pick up the black i'm literally going
11:08like poop like one thing and then tapping off the excess and you can see
11:14the pigment that gives
11:21ok so at this point i have used almost all the matte shades except i have not
11:25used this one just because i personally and not like matt white vanilla cream
11:30kind of girl i know that tons of people are which is why everyone's in their
11:32palates I'm not on for the purpose of this video I'm going to go in with a
11:37sugar color but typically I would just leave it like this and put on some
11:40lashes mascara and clean my brows and all that jazz but i'm going to use one
11:44of the shimmer so we can see how they apply and I don't know which one ordered
11:49I'm going to do this one it picks up nicely like I want to
11:52I'm grabbing it with my brush like it seems to pick up nice it doesn't have
11:55like doesn't get chunky or anything i'm going to go ahead and apply it right in
11:59here in the inner corner
12:02ok so i'm not getting much of anything on my eyes but I actually thought about
12:08this was applying the matte shadow beforehand because it most of the time
12:13when you apply a matte shadow before a shimmer shadow you don't get any color
12:19payoff and I thought about that as i was applying the matte shadow look at this
12:22was on just regular bare skin i wonder if it'd be different
12:25so what I'm going to do is I'm going to like prime back of my hand really quick
12:28and i'm going to apply it to my hand to see if it applies better because it
12:33might be because the fact that i just put a matte shadow down and then
12:37shimmers don't work i'm going to apply the exact same shadow that I just tried
12:41to apply on my legs I feel like I didn't give it like a fair chance i don't want
12:45to say that it's terrible before I try this
12:47so this is tiger eye again the same one that I used on my island i'm going to
12:51pick up the same amount on my brush right there and let's see if we apply it
12:55like this
12:56okay see now look now we're getting pigment like its supposed to have let me
13:02grab the other eye shadow wipe off my brush I'm going to grab the other
13:04shimmer and try
13:06okay see so they are showing up on my hand with a brush perfectly fine so I'm
13:14going to just say that the reason it's not showing up on my lid is because the
13:18fact that i use a matte shadow first i'm going to go back over which is a little
13:22bit more black eyeshadow because I just want to look to be smoky
13:26you know I figure if we're doing a first impression videos of eyeshadow like we
13:30get to do something dark and smoky and really see what the shadows can do right
13:35all right I'm just grabbing a brush and wiping away my under eye area to get rid
13:43of all that bacon judge and now you can see what that translucent powder did for
13:49my eyes how it made it like a nice slam right there see how it just cleans it up
13:54and gives you a cat eye
13:56it's a really nice tip can see it right there
14:00I'm just going to make this a little bit sharper facebook to learn that me and I
14:10was like wait a second
14:11this looked a little on the blender if you ask me
14:15okay i'm going to grab the middle shade right here and the very top it's another
14:20shimmer and it is in the shade courts
14:22i'm going to attempt to highlight my brow bone this don't know it's going to
14:25be too dark so let's try this one I don't know we'll find out
14:31oh yeah it works ok cool it's working
14:39I'm going over it with Jasper which is the light creamy matte shade
14:47I'm going to pop on a pair of lashes i have not tried yet
14:53and they are fluff and dolled up so by the lower lashes on my god dog up i used
14:58to wear those back in the day but these are like the newest silk version of them
15:03alright so now i have my lashes on and I'm so mad at myself and I was applying
15:07mascara
15:08I got it right here like a huge glob and I had trying to get rid of it and it's
15:13much my eyeshadows and my eye shadow looks like it's all like unblended my
15:18this is my actual name they're all right I'm going to grab a pencil brush this is
15:23like an old pencil brush from sedona lace from like years ago
15:27I'm going to grab the shade right here the warm kind of caramel brown shade i'm
15:32going to just put that right on my lower lash line
15:43now i'm going to take this reddish brown shade in the far corner and i'm going to
15:47put that right over top
15:53my the only person that doesn't really look at themselves like when they do
15:57this like they just feel for it and just look around the room
16:02I'm going to pick up a small definer brush like this right here and I'm going
16:05to dip into the black
16:07i'm going to put that just on the outer corner of my lower lash line
16:11I'm trying so hard not to make my face when I always do when i apply eyeshadow
16:22on my lower lash line
16:24Oh almost made it to that that was a lot of work
16:30i'm going to apply some mac coast outreach
16:33I pencil in my waterline because i think my wife looks a little bare
16:51alright so i just threw on some makeup obviously to finish off my luck but I
16:55figured you guys might want to see that because this video is about this bad boy
16:57right here right
16:58so i will say that my overall take away from this palette is that if you are
17:03looking for every day
17:05neutral basic palette just applied easily you're not looking for anything
17:08that
17:09- metallic not looking for anything that's too difficult or too bright or
17:12intense
17:13this would be the palette for you it is a great everyday like girl next door
17:17palette i will say for me personally I wish that he shivers had more of a pop
17:22more like a metallic miss to it but that's because i am secretly a drag
17:26queen insights
17:27I always apply my shimmers with mac fix+ or unless they're like a really intense
17:32already much how i like foil shadow
17:35I'll if i go on the shimmer our to be shimmer like I don't want a subtle
17:38shimmer I want like glitter
17:39you know um but some like my sister who just loved like that everyday look like
17:44she would love these shimmers because they have a nice color palette but
17:47there's a very subtle when I tried to apply it over my matte eyeshadow it did
17:52not work but honestly I was stupid for even trying to do in the first place
17:55I know better than that but when I prime my hand and put it on my hand with the
17:59brush
17:59they were beautiful so I honestly don't think that that's kind of how she
18:02intended it because the fact that there are so many more max there's only two
18:06shimmers in the nine color palette so everything that she didn't want you to
18:10be very vibrant and intense obviously because she made them a little bit more
18:14subtle post like a really intense like metallic creamy shimmery eyeshadow you
18:19know overall i would give this palette and a for sure i would get the packaging
18:24and eight plus this is sick nasty islands packaging so much and I was
18:28Kylie out of blow this image up like gigantic like the size of a wall and
18:32then put up my couch for my better something exciting is just so cool
18:35anyways I'm gonna stop rambling thank you so much for watching this video you
18:38guys I really hope that you enjoy
18:40I love you thank you so much for requesting this
18:42and I will see you in my next video bye
0:16hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look right
0:22here I told you guys that would be doing something different and colorful and
0:25smoky and this is exactly what i was referring to so I just want to say thank

0:39it wasn't for your request so thank you so much for that
0:42this look is structure it is intense and his dramatic is over the top
0:46I absolutely love it this look is for my Queens or more like a day-to-day neutral
0:51girl at times other tutorials for that and i'll be back with more than to look
0:54later but today we are feeling ourselves
0:58okay that's better lost my staff members like it
1:02I know the Blues can be intimidating but just don't forget to blend and take your
1:06time and all will work out I promise practice makes perfect and that my mom
1:10always said late at night before you wash your face just pull out your makeup
1:14brushes pull out your palate and just do your makeup provide minutes and if
1:17you're trying to learn new techniques like this lower last technique or a
1:20winged liner just try for five minutes every night
1:23it's just make up a white sauce you can just try it wipe it off try it wipe it
1:26off wash your face go to bed sleep on it try the next night you know what I'm
1:29saying if you do that for a few nights in a row i promise you can earn any
1:32technique that you want nothing is intimidating
1:35nothing is too hard to achieve a makeup you got this and remember it's just
1:39makeup
1:39you know I'm saying wipes right off and you can forget it ever happened
1:42enjoy the video i love you guys and I'll see you soon bye
1:45hello my loves my eyes already primed and i'm going to be going in with make a
1:51geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow i know i use this in the beginning of every
1:55single makeup look
1:56but it's so similar my skin tone going back and forth with this in my entire
2:00crease area just makes it so that no matter what colors I choose to go in
2:03with its going to blend easily
2:05now i'm going to go in with makeup geek unexpected this is the perfect
2:09transition color if you're working with blues or purple because the cool cool
2:14tone grayish purple is just perfect and it's matched so using that same Sigma
2:18e-40 i'm going to dust that back and forth all the way from the inner corner
2:21to the outer corner in the upper crease area
2:24now i'm going to go in with the star of the show and this is anastacio star
2:29cobalt this is a very intense metallic eyeshadow
2:32so when I apply this I pull my eyelid taught like you can see me pulling it
2:35there to really get all that pigment all over the entire lid and it gives a very
2:39shimmery look I'm going to make sure that i put this on the entire lower lid
2:43area but i do not want to go any further than my crease
2:47I want to keep this nice and low because the issue with colors like this is if
2:51you take it - hi all of a sudden that's when it becomes a mess
2:54so keep it low keep it on your lid and do not surpass your crease area
2:58now i'm going to go in with a sigma e25 brush and a little bit more of that
3:01unexpected eyeshadow and we are just going to begin to blend blend blend back
3:06and forth and windshield wiper motions all the way from the outer corner to the
3:09inner corner until you see that blue shade is no longer a harsh jagged line
3:14in the crease then i'm going to go in with mac blackberry eyeshadow
3:18this is just a few shades darker than unexpected which is why i'm going in
3:21with it because you want to start off with a lighter shade and then blend that
3:24and then go darker and then blend that you never want to just go in with a dark
3:28shade and expect that to blend out beautifully
3:30so you blend in between every single step and that is how you achieved a
3:34flawless blended smooth smokey eye that does not have any harsh jagged lines
3:38so once we have moved on from that step I'm going to take a makeup remover wipe
3:42and clean up the under eye and i will also use this to create kind of a cat I
3:47with that shadow
3:48it's a nice easy trick to kind of get that shape that you want that very
3:51sculpted I look and then i will go in with Maybelline gel liner and shader
3:55black is black and then just create a typical black winged liner
4:00the great thing about using and that makeup wipe to remove the excess and
4:03creating that harsh line as you can then follow it with your eyeliner so it makes
4:07it simple to do a wing
4:08now i'm going to go in with makeup geek poolside eyeshadow absolutely gorgeous
4:13I should have done this before my eyeliner but I didn't think about it and
4:16once my eyeliner was done I was looking in my eyes and I was like we need
4:18something else
4:19so taking the same brush this is the mac 242 that I used to apply the star cobalt
4:24i'm going to just tap this on the center of the lid and then blend out and as you
4:27can see it just gives the I much more dimension it just kind of brings that
4:30upper lid together then I'm just going to go over and fix my eyeliner and just
4:35kind of go over that and make it blacker because we completely messed up because
4:38I should have done that step first so if you are trying to throw us off at home
4:41do that part first then do your liner now I'm going to be applying lashes i am
4:45using house of lashes iconic these are my absolute favorite lashes at the
4:49moment I can't get enough of them
4:51I wear them every day I wear them with no liner liner a smoky eye a neutral I I
4:55swear they are just so gorgeous i'm in love with them right now we're going to
4:59go in and Prime at my skin and I am using makeup forever
5:01radiance primer using clean hands of course we're going to use this all over
5:05our entire face and then i'm going to be using a newer foundation today and this
5:10is by the brand LC cosmetics
5:12oh my gosh you guys I talked about this on snapchat I'm just so in love with it
5:16right now and i'm also going to be wetting my face with some mac fix+ the
5:20reason I'm doing this is because this LC foundation is definitely made for those
5:24of you who are more oily to normal
5:26maybe combination skin since I am dry I don't want it to be so Matt so i use a
5:31radiance primer and then i use a dewy skin missed or a mac fix+ just to give a
5:35little bit more of a glow to the skin because it will dry extremely mad on me
5:39i am using it be more foundation brush this is the m4 39 my favorite foundation
5:43brush right now it just smooths everything out so beautifully and
5:46because of the size and the density it just makes it so that you don't have a
5:49build up a foundation on the skin and you don't go overboard
5:52now i'm going to do with the under eye concealer of course I wanted a bright
5:57highlight today so i'm going to start off with using the Urban Decay
5:59weightless naked concealer i think it's called something like that you know what
6:03I'm talking about
6:03i'm going to use this in a triangle motion I'm going to take it down the
6:06sides of my nose and I'm going to drag it back toward the temple using a very
6:11damp Beauty Blender I'm going to blend that out word i'm bringing that down on
6:15the cheek area and then I'm going to take it all the way up to kind of
6:18emphasize the center of the cheeks and then up towards the temple to give that
6:21lift
6:22i'm also going to even out that highlight by putting it on the chin
6:25the upper lip the nose and the center of the forehead and then again go back with
6:30the damp beauty blender and blend that out using a damp Beauty Blender will
6:33make sure that you have tons of excess product it will pick it up and you don't
6:36have cake face that's why i love the beauty blender because like right there
6:39i put a little too much product in my upper lip but that's ok when you're
6:42working with the beauty blender because it'll pick up the excess and you're not
6:45going to have cake frosting see on your upper lip because that's not good on
6:48anybody
6:49i'm going to set my under eye concealer and i'm using a mac
6:51emphasize which is a pro product and i'm going to mix it with the anastacio
6:55banana concealer and i'm going to really highlight that under area again on the
6:59size of the nose the cheeks up towards the temple and then i will also set it
7:02on the chin
7:03the Cupid's bow the nose and a little on the forehead as well because we want to
7:07even out that highlight you're going to highlight you got a highlight do it all
7:11girl don't miss any spots
7:12now i'm going to go in and take care of dem browse i am using anastacio brow Wiz
7:18in the shade
7:20nope i believe and then once i have filled in my brows
7:23I as always use a little bit of concealer underneath that brow just to
7:26help carbon out and give it a little bit more dimension especially on the arch of
7:30the brow
7:31now i'm going to go in with mac shroom eyeshadow
7:34i'm going to use this to highlight the upper brow bone I absolutely love
7:38highlighting the brow bone especially when you're doing a smoky eye it just
7:41give that glamazon very bombshell look to the eyes and I just think that it is
7:47beautiful so I always make sure to highlight then i'm going to also
7:50highlight generously on the inner corner of the eye because the technique we're
7:53going to use on the bottom lash line is really going to pop with this highlight
7:58on the inner corner so I'm packing on that highlight and then i'm going to go
8:01in with the anastacio cream color and the shade ice blue
8:05she came out with i think five or six of these cream colors and they're so
8:09pigmented they are amazing
8:11I was nervous for putting on my waterline was going to irritate my eyes
8:13but it didn't it didn't burn it didn't sting is gonna irritate them which is
8:17surprising because I my eyes get so irritated so easily in this color like
8:21can we talk about it is so beautiful
8:23now i'm going to go in with mac navel this is a pro color so you can get on
8:27mac cosmetics , or at prostores is a very dark navy blue kind of purple shade
8:33it is more on the cool side which is different for me but that's why I chose
8:36it it's gorgeous and I love that it's a matte color so i am just using an angled
8:40brush as you can see i believe this is Action Anastasio brow brush technically
8:44but whatever
8:45moving on I'm gonna line this very tightly on the lower lash line and then
8:49once i get to that inner corner
8:50as you can see instead of sticking to my lash line going to cut it go down and
8:55create almost the effect of a cat I i do have a tutorial going in depth on this a
8:59little bit more i will link it down below it was my trendy i tutorial i
9:02believe it's called as you can see here
9:04i right i just was not as perfect as a left so I went in with a little bit of
9:08concealer on a definer brush and I just kind of clean it up
9:11we all make mistakes but it's okay it's just makeup you can clean up your
9:14mistakes and move on no one ever knows i'm going to just blend out that lower
9:17lash line using any pencil brush
9:19I don't really have any additional products on this I just kind of went in
9:22and blend it out I didn't want the bottom lash line to be too overly smokey
9:26I wanted it to be nice and defined but I didn't want to be too intense just like
9:29a jagged line
9:30I never like jagged lines let's get real i'm all about that blending life
9:34I'm gonna call my lower lashes with mascara and now i'm going to go in and
9:36contour today i'm going to be using if you make it forever bronzer and number
9:4030 and we are going to kick it old school baby with the NARS eat a brush
9:43oh I forgot how much I missed this brush you guys I love it so much if you want
9:48to structure contour i still stand behind this brush it is so amazing as
9:52you can see right here the proof is in the pudding
9:54it's just so easy to contour with it just makes such a beautiful line but
9:58because the bristles are nice and kind of fluff out
10:01it's not too intense and too harsh to the point that you're like oh dear god
10:04it's just an amazing brush i absolutely love it
10:07now i'm going to go in with blush and i am using a beka blush in the shade sweet
10:12pea
10:12and i'm going to be using the morphe for blush brush which by the way this is the
10:17first blush brush ever that has made me turn my back on the mac 129
10:20it is amazing I'll talk about more in depth later but I just absolutely love
10:25it
10:25now i'm going to carve out my contour i'm using the morphe 510 brush and any
10:30light powder that you have as long as it's matt will do for this
10:33put it right underneath that contour and then just wipe it away and that will
10:36help just kind of strength in your contour and make it look more structured
10:39so that it's not messy then taking a little bit of bronzer i'm going to put
10:43that right underneath the lower lip and it will help it look a little bit fuller
10:46and a little bit more pouty know all the tricks i decided to go back in with a
10:50little bit of black eyeshadow because I just felt like that inner corner wasn't
10:53popping enough for me
10:54so just taking a little bit of makeup geek corrupt i'm going to put that on
10:57that inner corner
10:58just for a little bit more of a pop then i'm going to highlight the cheeks and
11:02i'm going to be using the hourglass ambient lighting powder in the shade
11:05luminous light
11:06i'm using the morphe and 501 brush for this this is like my favorite
11:09highlighter brush of all time and i'm going to place this all over the cheeks
11:13the cheekbones for a little bit of a glow that i'm going to set my eyebrows
11:16with anastacio clear brow gel which is the best brow gel and the entire world i
11:20swear to god it's super glue in a tube for your browse
11:22now i'm going to pair this look with a nude lip
11:25I was going back and forth and I didn't want to do a pink or peach because these
11:28eyes just makes such a statement
11:30so I decided to go with anastacio liquid lipstick in the shade pure Hollywood
11:34which was a beautiful nude and what I love about it is it stays all day
11:37because it's a liquid lipstick and it doesn't require a lip liner so last but
11:41not least we're just going to now set our face i'm using Urban Decay to makeup
11:44setting spray just to lock all this and and we are done

0:58just remember that you can of course modify this look and create your own
1:02version of this cat I to fit your knees your eye shape and what you are
1:05comfortable with but i absolutely love this I love the technique is completely
1:10different than anything I've ever done before and you guys will see how easy it
1:13actually is it looks much more complicated and complex and like a
1:16picture that you're going to see that actually is so i hope that you guys
1:19enjoy enjoy making this tutorial for you i love you guys and if you want to see
1:23how to achieve this look then just keep watching my god
1:26hey guys so first thing I'm doing is moisturizing my lips I always do this
1:30before i start my makeups my lips it goes on more smoothly at the end and
1:34there's no what chapped lips get in the way that I'm going to throw my hair up
1:37in a high ponytail so I get all that hair out of my face so you guys can see
1:40what we're doing
1:41I'm going to prime my lids i'm using a mac pro longwear concealer and nw20 is
1:46my favorite all-time primer for the lids because it conceals and primes at the
1:49same time so it's perfection then i'm going to be going in with my new babies
1:54oh my gosh i love these eyeshadows so much these are the new anastacio Beverly
1:58Hills single eyeshadows they will be releasing next month and you guys will
2:02be the first to know because i will let you know the second they release
2:06they are beautiful I'm going to be going in with the shade birkin this is just a
2:11really nice
2:12neutral tone it's great for that crease area as a transition color is very
2:16similar to like a mac soft brown type shade if you're familiar with that i am
2:20using a Sigma e-40 blending brush to dust this all over the entire crease
2:24area you can put this all over the lid if you want you don't really have to
2:27we're really just focusing on that crease area i'm just buffing it out nice
2:31and gently with no harsh lines that i'm going to be going in with a gel eyeliner
2:35this is the key to this look I'm using Maybelline eye studio it from the
2:38drugstore it's black as can be and it's awesomesauce
2:41so what I'm going to do is create an outer wing i am using a e65 by Sigma I
2:48don't know what brush that was for a minute
2:50i'm going to create kind of like a bat type wing where I literally just carve
2:54out that V and then sharpen it up once I've done that I'm going to go in with
2:57the shade smoke
2:58this is again going to be a new shade by anastacio beverly hills and then using a
3:03more fee and three two one brush which is literally the most perfect brush for
3:06this technique I'm going to take that brown color and literally as your scene
3:10just smudge it and some oak it out it is so simple
3:14I'm going to go back with that same black liner and just darken it up a bit
3:18and you will have this look right here
3:20it's so simple but it looks more so much more complex than it is now i'm going to
3:24do is just go in and do a normal liner right on that lash line just like you
3:28would any other day just to kind of connect that wing to the inner corner
3:32now i'm going to do to create that inner corner cat eye is follow the natural
3:36tier duct of my eye
3:38some people's inner corners are going to go a little bit more down than others
3:40some are going to go more straight out
3:42i typically find if you want to look the best for your eye shape when your eyes
3:45are open and close
3:46just follow that natural tear duct so now i'm obviously just going to do the
3:50exact same thing to the other eye again I just draw out that V with an angled
3:55brush and I just fill it in as you'll see right here you might feel like wait
3:59what do I do with the eyeliner because you actually want to connect it to
4:02something don't just literally a buff into the i leave it alone
4:06go back with a super dark brown matte shade and just buff it out
4:10you don't really want about that . color up into the crease you more want to buff
4:13it towards the inner corner of the eye to really give you that long it elevated
4:16cat eye effect then again do your liner just like you usually would
4:20along that lash line and then make sure you take it all the way to the outer
4:23corner so that does connect with that wing again I'm going to do the inner
4:28corner of the same way that the other eye
4:30this might be easier for some of you just using a precise eyeliner brush it's
4:33not an angle brush I definitely think an angle brush can be a little bit harder
4:36but it's just what I'm used to
4:38I'm going to go in with the lower lashes in the style lash in the city but I
4:42always cold my lashes with a thin coat of mascara first before going in
4:46I think it makes it blend a little bit better and also i never ever going with
4:49mascara after my false lashes are on because it can cut down the longevity in
4:53the life of your lashes and make them look a little bit more fake and I want
4:58my false lashes to look as pretty and fluffy as they possibly can so I don't
5:02go in with mascara afterwards I always do it first then i'm going to move on to
5:05foundation I'm using our glass of ale foundation
5:08it's a very pretty eliminating foundation i will say though that it has
5:11a high SPF in it so it does smell like SPF just a warning i'm going to be going
5:15in with a morphe brush this is the end for 39
5:19i believe for foundation absolutely obsessed I've used only twice and i'm
5:22already claiming i'm obsessed you know what's love when I've only used it twice
5:25i'm using the word obsessed
5:28moving on I'm doing my eyebrows and I just showed you the first one super
5:31quickly because it was really out of focus the entire time i'm going to show
5:33you this one a little bit more slowly
5:36i am using the anastacio browse in the shade
5:39oh no i forgot the shade soft brown taupe
5:42I don't know i'll link it down below for you guys but I am going to go ahead and
5:46fill in my brows like normal with you guys want an updated brow routine
5:49just let me know in the comments section down below I'm going to conceal my under
5:53eye area and i am using NARS radiant creamy concealer to do this
5:57I know a lot of you've been saying recently that i have exchanged this one
6:00for the mac pro longwear and it's true you guys I just been using this recently
6:04i go through phases and this is just it's my boy right now so it's what we're
6:08doing I've been enjoying it and if you guys are wondering i do my concealer and
6:13foundation after my eyes when i'm doing a smoky or a cat eye look
6:17because sometimes you can mess up your foundation if you do your eyes
6:20second so doing your eyes first will ensure that you have the perfect
6:24foundation application and eyes as always i'm going to set my under eye
6:29area i am using
6:30mac pro longwear emphasize powder mixed with an associate of Beverly Hills
6:35banana powder this is from her contour kit and it also has put a little bit of
6:39that on my chin and my forehead just to even that out cuz sometimes a highlight
6:43underneath the eyes by itself can be a little overwhelming when you don't
6:45balance it around the face
6:47I'm going to go in with that same smoke color from anastacio if you guys can
6:51tell this is like the easiest thing ever right it's only two eyeshadows that is
6:55creating this look like
6:56yes please I'm going to go back in with that original shape that we went in
6:59Birken and i'm going to just buff that out with a pencil brush on this entire
7:03lower lash line
7:04if you guys don't have to be super smoky you can leave this part out and just do
7:08mascara and call it a day
7:10I wanted to blow it out I wanted to show you guys the full production the full
7:13effect and all the drama and potential this look really has
7:16so I'm going to call my lower lashes with Rima lash accelerator this is from
7:19the drugstore and it's one of my favorite lower lash mascara because it
7:23really separates your lashes and I don't like coffee bottom lashes
7:26I'm going to go in with mac cosmetics mylar I wanted to keep this look very
7:31mad I didn't want a lot of shimmer and it because I just absolutely love a
7:34smoky Matt I like who doesn't it's classic and it's timeless and my lawyer
7:38is a beautiful highlight that isn't a full map but it's not a shimmer house
7:41like this beautiful gleam to it then I'm going to go in and just do a little
7:45bronzing and contouring i am using a nars bronzer in the shade algorithm
7:50this is part of their holiday collection and i am using a morphe brush this is
7:55the 200m be 5 NB five and i'm going to bronze my face I'm going around my
8:01cheekbones around the temples in the forehead
8:04I absolutely love this brush i have been singing its praises for the past like
8:07three tutorials straight
8:09but seriously bomb.com I'm going to go back in with a makeup geek precision
8:12brush and just create a little line right there underneath the cheekbones
8:16just to accentuate this contour a little bit more so I really like a structured
8:21contour with a cat i think it's very flattering
8:24I'm going to go and with mac mineralize blush in the shade dainty which is just
8:28a really pale flattering girly pink so pretty i'm going to lightly dust that on
8:32the cheeks nothing too intense but we just want to have a little bit of a
8:35flush
8:36this looks painful honestly this shot makes me cringe
8:39anyways I'm going to be applying and I call on that lower water
8:43line in the struggle is real as always as you can see and then i'm going to
8:47finish this off with my new lipstick
8:50this is called buttercup you guys are the first to see in the first to know I
8:55am so excited to be using this and introducing it to you

0:36different and just up in the box
0:38it's ok i hear my eye so anyway this is not the only way to wear a shadow of
0:42course like i did it very dramatic you can wear a really colorful shot like
0:46this in many different ways you can use it as a pop of color on that lower lash
0:49line
0:50you can put it gently in the outer corner of your eye can kind of look it
0:53up from your eyeliner for a little purple pop over you can wet your brush
0:56and then go in and do liner with it that is really really fun but you don't need
1:01to they're all or nothing
1:02I really wanted to see the shadow and its full capacity so i did a very
1:05dramatic blown out purple smokey eye which I love creating for you so yeah I
1:10really hope that you guys enjoyed this tutorial i enjoyed making it for you so
1:14thank you so much for watching and I'll see you soon
1:16but hey guys i am so ready to do this
1:20so the first thing I'm going to do is take smaller i call this is by Mac
1:24smaller is a jet-black putting a black color all over the lid is going to make
1:28any eye shadow you choose to put on later pop like crazy which you'll see in
1:32just a few minutes but right now i'm going to just sloppily put this all over
1:36my lid area
1:37cute so cute and I'm going to buff it out with an e 32 from sigma buffing out
1:44on I coal is actually a lot easier than you would imagine it to be because it is
1:47such a crummy pencil as you can see it really has a nice gradient to as your
1:51buffing out the only thing you want to make sure to do is not exceed your
1:55crease area as you can see as I'm buffing it out i'm not going anywhere
1:59past the crease in my eyelid
2:01so again i'm going to put that all over the lid and I wanted to be the blackest
2:05of the black right next to the lash line and then of course your buffing out and
2:09just kind of fading it once you get up towards that crease
2:11now i'm going to be going in with a new makeup forever artists eye shadow and if
2:15you can't tell i'm very excited about this color is in the shade em - 928
2:19don't worry i'll link it down below for you and taking a sigma e25 brush I'm
2:23going to buff that in that entire crease area
2:26so this is just the next step we want to go from black to this plummy purple you
2:30guys can we just talk about how beautiful those colors right now
2:32seriously I cannot deal with it
2:34so as you can see i'm bluffing is all the way to the inner corner to the outer
2:38corner we wanted to be just as dark and intense from inner to outer then next I
2:43am going to go in with the shade orchid
2:45this is by ardency Inn and i'm using the exact same brush and I'm going to just
2:49go over top of that make up for ever eyeshadow and it's okay if it kind of
2:52falls down on top of what we've already done because we're going to go in and
2:55cover a lot of this up anyways doing all these steps is just going to give your
2:58smoky eye a lot of dimension and a lot of pop
3:01so when you're moving your face and you're moving your eyes people are going
3:04to see all different colors shining through
3:05now we are going to go in with the star of the show and this is in the shade
3:09royal oh wow she's so video to wall
3:12i am using a mac 242 to pack this color on my entire lower lid area all the way
3:17from inner corner of the tear duct all the way to outer corner
3:20I'm going to push that all the way up in my crease and then once i get to that
3:24crease area i'm going to go back in with the same brush that I used to apply that
3:27make up for ever eyeshadow and just blend those two together so that
3:30everything is seamless will have a very gradient I from a very bright purple to
3:34a plummy to be pink if you know what I mean
3:37and so basically you guys laying down that smaller eyeliner in the first place
3:40is going to make this eyeshadow pop even more if you ever want to take a color to
3:44another level just put a black eyeliner on before and it will just give it a
3:48really intense extra pop this is a very payment to shadow no matter what but I
3:52just honestly wanted to have a lot of fun and just see what we could do with
3:55it
3:56so as you can see i am using an e 25 just buffing back and forth to make sure
3:59we have no harsh lines then i'm going to go in with a black eyeshadow i believe
4:04this one is Mac carbon and i am using a makeup geek small crease brush just to I
4:09think this is a makeup brush
4:10I'm not sure I like this brush down below I'm going to pack that black in
4:14the outer corner of my eye
4:16just for a little something extra i will say a lot of times people can get
4:19nervous using Purple's they don't look like they have a bruised eye and the
4:22trick to that is using black and not grey
4:25do not mix great with your purple because that's when you can start to
4:28look like you got hit in the face caught in a dark alleyway
4:31but like this using black it really just gives a little extra smokiness
4:35so then I'm going to go in with my favorite lashes of life at the moment
4:37and they are by the brand flutter laughs
4:39ashes and this style is in the shade in the shade in the style Camilla all my
4:45gosh just get ready
4:46look at those flash oh my god they're so gorgeous I honestly want to wear them
4:52every day but they're very dramatic so they definitely call for a dramatic look
4:56so I was going to clean up that entire under eye area because of course working
4:59with bright colors you're going to have some fallout that i'm going to go in and
5:02do my foundation i am using giorgio armani a luminous silk and for those of
5:06you who asked i am currently using 6.5 as my color i believe is that down below
5:13to everything is always below
5:15i'm using my Sigma f80 kabuki brush just to buff this into the skin if you can
5:19tell I really press when i'm using this brush because it makes the foundation
5:22last longer
5:23now i'm going to be filling in my brows and i'm going to be using an SEO brow
5:27powder to do so today just because I thought I'd change it up so i am using
5:30the shade
5:31blonde and soft brown to do that but that's not fun so let's move on
5:35I'm going to be highlighting my brow bone with mac nylon
5:38this is such a beautiful brow highlighter it is very intense so make
5:41sure that you are light-handed when using it
5:43i'm going to be using a sigma f 72 highlight even though it's a concealer
5:47brush
5:47it's my favorite to highlight the brow bone and as you'll see i will bring this
5:50highlight down a little bit and turn my brush sideways and blend it in with that
5:55shadow in the upper crease doing this really helps complete the blending
5:58process to make sure that you have no jagged edges are harsh lines in that
6:02shadow area and it's beautifully buffed out it's a great secret makeup artistry
6:06and it makes such a difference then i'm going to just of course conceal
6:10hello this is necessary i'm going to be using my NARS radiant creamy concealer
6:14and then i'm going to be buffing out with a damp Beauty Blender
6:18I always make sure to tell everybody and make sure your beauty blender is damp
6:22that is what it is made for get it wet underneath the sink squeeze squeeze
6:25squeeze
6:25and then use it to apply foundation or concealer it just moisturize and hydrate
6:29the skin and it makes it so that nothing ever gets cakey and it's just fast and
6:32easy and it just looks beautiful
6:34so then i'm going to set that under eye area as always with anastacio banana
6:38powder this is an absolute must for me but you do you
6:42i'm going to use a flat definer brush and just pack on that same royal
6:45eyeshadow tightly against that lower lash line all the way from outer corner
6:49-
6:50the corner i'm going to make sure to take this all the way into that tear
6:52duct because I really want this to be dramatic and dramatic and bring it all
6:56the way really make the shadow more dramatic going back with that exact same
7:01m2m 928 eyeshadow for make up for ever and a pencil brush I'm going to buff
7:06this back and forth all over that lower lash line area putting two colors like
7:11this on that lower lash line will just make your eyes pop even more and get
7:14more dimension then using an e 25 from sigma i'm really going to buff this down
7:19I do not have any product on it but as you can see i'm going to just go back
7:22and forth over all of this under eye area and i will circle around on the
7:26edge of my eye to really make this look blown out cuz i want this to be more of
7:30a rounded I and a cat eye
7:32so that's why I'm going around the edges but i'm going to just pop that same
7:35nylon eyeshadow on the inner corner with a tiny little definer brush from Mac
7:38just for another little pop I love highlighting the inner corner and the
7:42brow because it really just evens out the I then i'm going to just mascara my
7:46lower lashes with remote lash accelerator and now i'm going to be
7:49bronzing i am using a Make Up For Ever bronzer and number 20
7:53i'm using a nars a brush to sculpt out my face
7:57I will say number 20 and Make Up For Ever bronzer doesn't look dark when
8:00you're looking at it in the pan when you apply it to the face it's absolutely
8:04beautiful so even if you feel like you're kind of tan number 20 is really
8:07beautiful on tons of people
8:09so once i have done that I'm going to go in with becca flower child blush and i'm
8:13going to be using a mac 129 short handle brush to apply this all over the apples
8:18of my cheeks and then make sure you really blend into that contour so that
8:21everything is nice and buffed out of course they're going to go in with becca
8:25rose gold this is my favorite cheap product at the moment right now using a
8:29sigma taper highlighting brush I'm going to run that all over that blush area
8:33just to really make those cheeks pop and glow that i'm going to go in with a bite
8:37Beauty lip liner in the shade and nutmeg
8:40it's a really beautiful neutral pink color and i am using this to line the
8:43entire lip area and i will also fill in the lip area and then once i have the
8:47entire lips coated with nutmeg i'm going to go over it with my lip gloss i
8:52created with Gerard cosmetics in the shade buttercream which is amazing if I
8:56do say so myself
8:57and then once you have completed that you are completely finished with this
9:01look
9:02so hope that you guys enjoy this video thank you so much for watching
9:05I love you and I'll see you soon bye guys
0:16hey guys today I'm going to be doing in this makeup look at every single intro
0:23is always be a game and I'm gonna be going to make the turn on the look that
0:28I want right here anyway
0:29today I'm going to finally be going to make up tutorial i mentioned that was
0:33super pumped to fill my makeup tutorial like a month ago and this was a look
0:37that was referring to
0:38I have been so excited to film this love because I have to be honest I think this
0:42is the fate of my favorite look at least my favorite smokey eye and I've ever
0:46done here on YouTube but i love this look and the my favorite thing about it
0:50is that it will look good on every buddy any skin color any i call this is a
0:54comment absolutely everyone like it's got warmth in there and we get like up
0:58George
0:59he likes it too what I love about this look is it has some more than there but
1:03we also have a really fun color but the color is such an awesome
1:07wearable color for a smoky eye you know what I'm saying like if you're going to
1:10do a color of the smoky eye I definitely this is wearable and it's just so fun
1:14and it's different so i hope that you guys enjoy it
1:17I did add a double winged liner to this look you do not have to do that you want
1:21to do any liner you can do winged liner you can do just a regular black line you
1:25don't do anything special like I wanted to do this because the night that I came
1:28up with this look later that night I was in bed and I came across old photos of
1:32myself and when i first started working at Mac and I used to do the double
1:35winged liner all the time and I would you like a stripe in between out like a
1:40white stripe or like a yellow stripe in between the double wing and i was
1:44looking at that I was like oh my gosh it's so cool like I haven't done that in
1:47years so i thought i would incorporate it into this look to make it more fun so
1:50I what you guys do this video is not friendly i know i'm talking so much but
1:54that's because i miss you haven't been here in a while
1:56the past week has been so busy and the next week is also in certain busy I so
2:01many family and friends business associates all coming into town and I've
2:05had four meetings in the past week and it's just been a lot
2:07so starting februari fit everything is going fine go back to normal calm down a
2:12little bit but this like two week gap is like the busiest two weeks of my year
2:16pretty much so i am trying to be active on Twitter and Instagram though and they
2:20kind of keep talking to you guys so that you don't feel like I'm gone for too
2:23long so yeah I love you guys thank you so much for watching this video and i'll
2:27talk to you guys soon bye
2:28all right let's do this the first thing i'm going to do today is go in with
2:32makeup geek creme brulee and Peach Smoothie eyeshadow
2:35I'm going to mix those two together and then apply them in my upper crease area
2:38going all the way back and forth from my inner corner to my outer corner working
2:42in circular windshield wiper motions
2:45it is super important to lay down a light base as a transition color in that
2:48upper crease because it'll make everything else that you put on later
2:52blend seamlessly with no harsh lines
2:54i'm going in with an e 25 which is just a little bit of a denser brush just to
2:58make that color a little bit darker in the upper crease area then i'm going to
3:01go in with makeup geek cocoa bear this is one of my favorite shadows of all
3:05time and i realized i have not used it and quite a while and my videos so it's
3:09about that time again i'm going to take a knee 25 again and put that in the
3:12entire upper crease
3:14now i'm going to go in with a dark brown shade i honestly would not recommend
3:18this particular one this is ground brown from mac i would use whatever dark brown
3:22shade you have for yourself at home because it's almost kind of choppy and
3:25difficult to blend so I just want to go with this one if you got something else
3:29using a pencil brush from makeup geek which i absolutely love this brush I'm
3:34going to pack that on the inner corner of my eye right by mighty ducks and i'm
3:37also going to pack it on the outer corner of my eye as well
3:41leaving a blank space right in between kind of like a sandwich if you get this
3:45all over your lid don't worry because we're going to go in and cover a lot of
3:47it up anyways I always make sure to go back after every single step though and
3:51just blend everything out cuz that's really key - no harsh lines is
3:54continuously going back and blending
3:56now i'm going to go in with the star of the show and this is makeup geek oiled
3:59eyeshadow in the shade
4:01Houdini look at the beauty just take a moment oh my gosh
4:05the shadows are so gorgeous and i am using a mac 242 brush to apply this
4:09this is a flat synthetic brush which is just like my favorite brush ever to
4:13apply anything that's creamy or super shimmery or glittery because it really
4:16holds the product very beautifully and lays on the eyes beautifully as well so
4:21i'm going to put this all over the entire
4:23hi your lid for inner corner to outer corner and once i'm in that crease and I
4:27it's time to blend it into that cocoa bear that warm reddish-brown i'm going
4:31to go back with another blending brush and just go back and forth
4:34take your time do this for a few seconds I'm going windshield wiper motions and
4:37really make sure that those to kind of meet together beautifully and seamlessly
4:41so you don't have harsh lines because I completely covered up that dark brown
4:45was going to go back really quickly and pack a little bit more on the inner
4:48corner and the outer corner
4:50you could do this with a black as well to make it even more intense but i
4:53wanted to do brown because i just kind of like that brownish bluish kind of
4:57warm reddish-brown all together i think they're very complimentary and they just
5:01tied together beautifully
5:02and then once again i will go back in with the same blending brush and just
5:06make sure that all of that is blended out because I always blend every single
5:09step out then I'm going to take a q-tip and a little bit of eye cream or any
5:14moisturizer eye makeup remover whatever you have and I'm just going to gently
5:17kind of a wipe away the excess because sometimes you can get a little sloppy
5:20and this is a nice little trick to kind of sharpen up that outer corner make it
5:24look nice and energy so that it's not sloppy or you don't have fallout all
5:27over the place
5:28then I'm going to go in and do my eyeliner I'm using Maybelline gel liner
5:32in the shade of black is black as always an angled brush
5:36today I'm only going to do a little bit of liner on the outer corner i'm not
5:39gonna bring this liner all the way and across the lash line because i don't
5:43want to cover up this gorgeous shadow that I have going on
5:46so because of that i'm just going to do a half way and just kind of flick it on
5:49the very edge and then we'll be done with that I'm going to go in with a mac
5:52pro eyeshadow and this is in the shade
5:54Kelly I just wanted to add a little extra pop as you can see it's really not
5:58that big of a difference and not really that necessary but you know I'm having
6:01fun and doing my thing and so I wanted to add a little bit of this in the
6:04center just for giggles
6:06this is a mac pro item so you can purchase it online or mac pro stores
6:10it's not available at you know like regular counters or regular stores now i
6:14am applying the lower lashes in the style lash in the sea
6:18these have a little wing like a flick on the end of the false lashes which really
6:22compliments the winged liner look that we have as you can see right here the
6:25difference between both eyes but I did feel like the wing on the end it kind of
6:30slightly cover up my double winged liner so that's just a tip for you
6:34i am going to be priming my face with Smashbox photo finish
6:36primer water and oh my gosh you guys can we say obsession this is like my new
6:41baby so I'm going to douse myself in this primer water let it get a little
6:45dry
6:46of course dry off the lashes we don't need those things to be sitting there
6:48when the face and then i'm going to go in with my foundation I'm using make up
6:51for ever HD foundation and i am a number one two three
6:55as you can see my neck is number one two three and my face is like a negative
6:58zero so i am going to be matching my neck as always i'm using a sigma flattop
7:03f80 kabuki brush and i do miss it with a little bit of fixed plus from Mac just
7:07because I like how she was at my foundation a little bit and it has
7:10glitter in it so it helps just to kind of make everything stay together like
7:13glue for me
7:15some people can have reactions to fix plus so if you're super-sensitive so
7:18just be on the lookout for that
7:20so I'm just going to blend this all over the face as always nothing too special
7:24and I know that sometimes I can look a little yellow and this is going on but
7:27listen I'm matching my neck and that is what's important it will all tie
7:31together in the end I promise I'm going to of course conceal as always i'm using
7:36a mac pro longwear concealer my favorite concealer of life and a damp beauty
7:40blender which is my favorite way to blend out my concealer ever so i take
7:43this down the side of my nose and I go up towards my temple and it's very big
7:47upside down triangle motion and I blend all that out and then i dab some on the
7:51center of my nose
7:52the center of my forehead I always put a little bit on my chin and my upper lip
7:56on my Cupid's bow as well just to even out that highlight so that we do not
7:59have stock white under eyes and everything else is tad we want
8:02everything to be nice and even
8:04now i'm going to be going in and doing a contour and i am using the Chanel soleil
8:09de tan ok wow we're just moving on i'm using this cream bronzer from chanel and
8:13i am using an FTE again from sigma to do this
8:17I do prefer the f-86 which is angled but that was dirty so we're working with
8:21what we got right now so I'm going to put this all over the cheekbones and
8:24also the temples and the top of the forehead right by my hairline and then
8:29we're going to go in and sculpt this out a little bit
8:31I do intend on doing a full cream contour and highlight video very soon
8:37it's been very highly requested so i'm going to skip through this pretty
8:40quickly for you guys are not going to too much detail but i am using the
8:43Smashbox contour sticks to do this process that i am working with her right
8:47now and i'm using a damp beauty blender to blend
8:50everything out now a harsh harsh contour like this on day to day basis might not
8:54be so ideal and might not be ideal for any of you but I like a really intense
8:59striking contour when you're working with smoky eyes in a very dramatic look
9:02so I of course as always i'm going to set my under eye concealer and then i'm
9:06going to move on to my under eye area so i am using an angled brush this one is
9:11by morphy and i'm going back with the original color from makeup geek in the
9:14shade creme brulee and i'm going to just lightly kind of carve out that lower
9:19double wing that we're going to be doing
9:21I do want my double wing to be kind of smoky so that's why I'm starting off
9:24with a shadow and not just immediately going in with a black intense liner but
9:28i will go in and continue to make it a little bit more intense with liner but
9:33as you can see i'm going to do is go from that lower lash line and just run
9:36it parallel to that winged liner that we already have on the top lid this when
9:41you look at it looks like wow that's too complicated that's too much for me but
9:44if you really try on your own I you'll probably be very quickly surprised how
9:48easy this actually is to do on yourself
9:51so going back with a little teeny blending brush i'm just going to blend
9:54all that out because i do want it to be a little bit smokier than normal
9:58then with a little bit of concealer and a finer brush I'm going to put that in
10:01between those two wings so that it kind of stands out and it's a little bit more
10:05defined
10:06can we talk about how crazy is I didn't bring that blew down on my lower lash
10:09line
10:10I always bring the color down my lower lash line and today I did it and it's
10:13like what
10:14who am i but i really really like this i think that it just makes it look a
10:18little bit different than something that I would normally wear
10:20so I am is going back with that black gel liner and making it more intense i
10:24did just fill in my brows by the way I felt like it was unnecessary to put that
10:27on camera since i recently did an update a brow tutorial I am going to highlight
10:31my inner corner of my eye I'm using Mac nylon which is a very intense highlight
10:37I absolutely love it i use it for brow highlight cheek bone highlight any
10:40height you need
10:41nylon is a very intense shimmery yellow based highlight and very beautiful on
10:46tons of different skin tones so now i'm going to go in and I'm going to line my
10:50lower waterline i am using ardency Inn eyeliner and the black is color they
10:54have it is the creamiest of all time and then i'm going to go in and cut my lower
10:59lashes with mac google black mascara
11:02now i'm going to be highlighting my cheekbones and i am using the hourglass
11:05ambient lighting palette the center shade i'm not sure what it's called
11:08right now but look at how gorgeous this is it's like heavenly it's so beautiful
11:13i am using a sigma tapered highlighting brush to do this and then over top of
11:17that i'm going to lay down makeup geek spellbound blush which is a really
11:21beautiful kind of muted rosy pink and I just think that it looks absolutely
11:25gorgeous over top of this highlight it's like it's beaming through the blush
11:29I love it now to finish everything off i'm going to be going in with this new
11:32kat von d contour and highlight kit and honestly you guys i am just using an
11:36excuse to use this because i am so in love with this kit i am using the brush
11:41that you can buy along with it just to kind of set all the contour that I did
11:45earlier and sculpt out the John the chin and just make everything a little bit
11:49more precise and cut then i'm going to go in and finish off this look by doing
11:52my lips and i am starting off with the Urban Decay liner in the shade native
11:56I'm not overdrawn my lips or anything like that i'm just using it as a base
12:00and then i'm going to go in with lime crime coquettes which is one of my
12:04favorite lipsticks ever it's a nice kind of peachy pink kind of nude shade
12:09I love lime crime lipsticks because they last such a long time on my lips
12:11personally and then to finish everything off i'm going to go in with my favorite
12:15makeup setting spray and this is urban decay chill makeup setting spray you use
12:19whatever you want you do you boo
12:21that completes this look I hope that you guys enjoyed thank you so much for
12:24watching i love you guys and I'll see you soon
0:18hey guys so for today's video I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this
0:24look at just the right here
0:25all of my place I am really really excited to be doing this look because i
0:30have been wanting to do this look for about five weeks now and i was debating
0:33if I should do it or not
0:35sounds like I just say screw into a spring tutorials like I gotta do it
0:39I've been thinking about this look for way too long to not do it I five weeks
0:43I've been what I've been planning this look out honestly I talk to you guys
0:45about on snapchat
0:47I had to get this out of my system guys before jumping into a spring tutorials
0:51i'm very excited for spring and summer trends not excited for spring and summer
0:55because here in florida i get so humid enjoy brace yourselves
0:58but spring and summer makeup trends mmm very excited about
1:03I can't flippin wait flippin know why I that such a funny term
1:07oh yeah so for today's video I'm doing a brown and glittery smokey eye and let me
1:12just tell you it has been a journey
1:14finding a beautiful dark brown glitter
1:17I have been online for about four weeks ordering glitter from all different
1:21companies and even company the cell like over a hundred different litters
1:25it's so hard to find like a beautiful true dark brown leather so for today's
1:31video i use the pretty star groundwater that I could personally find on my hunt
1:35for today's tutorial I carried my silky I with a really intense dark brown lip
1:40and i'll be honest when the dark brown lip first came to the scene and people
1:44were wearing it I was like no thank you all passed that looks like doodoo all up
1:47on your lips
1:48not for me within about three weeks I was like
1:51do I absolutely love a dark brown lip now but it is not for everybody so for
1:57those of you who want to recreate this look
1:59don't think that you need to put a bullet you can do a nude and neutral lip
2:02and you will totally be good to go
2:05i'm going to call it the circle because it drives me crazy it's a very long
2:08story but people have asked questions about it and an electrician came here
2:12and made this mark on my wall
2:14he didn't have a pen with him and he's like well I don't have a pen as it will
2:17all I have eyeliner and he was a battle work
2:19so with my eyeliner he was like oh like a move that's what that is but this is
2:25changing very soon so it'll be gone for those of you who are like like I get it
2:29I'm like I'm like that - I'm nosy one of those girls let's just
2:33I get it I'm going to stop babbling now I swear to God I see that in the
2:36beginning of every single video don't I
2:37but anyways keep in mind that even though that this is a really dark smoky
2:41look this can still do more in the spring there are no rules there's trends
2:45of course but if you want to rock this and like at on a date night and the
2:48spring and girl do you all wear these colors all spring along like of course
2:52so that's the beauty of makeup people set trends but you're a person too so
2:56you can set a trend and I'm saying transferred to my people
2:59where people look for around friends I'm gonna be wearing this in the spring and
3:02summer
3:03you do what you want to do that's the beauty of makeup i love you guys so much
3:06for watching this video and i will see you guys in my next video bye guys
3:11hello my friends thank you for joining me here today
3:14first thing to do is pick up my morphe 35o palette and I'm going to grab this
3:18really light orange II kind of pale peachy shade us one of my favorites and
3:24using the morphe m4 for one brush I'm going to put this in my crease
3:29today I'm going to try to keep the colors a little bit lower on my eye
3:31because it's going to be really bold and intense so I don't want to go overboard
3:34and go up too high to the brow that i'm going to grab the shade which is a
3:38little bit more neutral but in the same tone as the first day that we went in
3:42with I'm going to pack that literally right on top
3:45the reason i will go in with two or three shades on top of each other is
3:49because it makes your job easier when blending out shades when you only blend
3:53out one color can make its kind of difficult you can sit there for a while
3:55can be kind of choppy when you go in with multiple shades over top of each
3:59other just a little bit at a time
4:01it blends out easier and it gives more dimension to the eye
4:03now i'm going to go in with this darker brown shade this is one of my favorite
4:07colors in the palette because it's such a beautiful brown it's not cool
4:11whatsoever but it's not to neutral and it's not too warm and it's the perfect
4:14shade of brown it's not too dark
4:17I absolutely love it so with that color I'm going to do the exact same thing as
4:20before and I'm going to pack that right on in the crease keeping it nice and low
4:24as you can see all the way to the inner corner but i'm not going to go up
4:27whatsoever on the bridge of the nose i'm going to keep it nice and flat on the
4:31inner corner
4:31I don't want this to be blown out to dramatic today since it's going to be
4:35such a dramatic intense dog
4:37I I don't look like i've been hit punched in the face is not a cute look
4:41so now i'm going to pick up a Natasha danone a palette and I'm going to use
4:44the shade
4:45aight aight viso 88 V and now i'm using the morphe em 433 rush
4:51this is my go-to blending brush if you guys need one blending i brush this is
4:55the one I would go with
4:56I can't live without this brush and as you can see this is a warm dark brown if
5:00you don't want to spend the money on Natasha danone shades i would suggest
5:03Mac swiss chocolate it's extremely similar to the shade
5:07you'll get the same result pretty much i'm going to pass that on the lid in the
5:10exact same area that I do with the other colors really making sure that its
5:13darkest in the crease of the eye and I'm going to go back and with my original
5:17blending brush with no product on it and just run over the edges to make sure
5:20that it's all blended out but as you can see i'm keeping it nice and light and
5:24I'm sorry not like nice and tight and low on the lid so it's not too dramatic
5:29and over the top
5:30now i'm going to pick up a kat von d and this is occur metal crush shadows I
5:34believe they're called in the shade energy and then i'm going to dampen my
5:38brush with mac fix+ and everyone always asks i put the product on my brush first
5:43and then I dampen it that's how I think I get the best results and now i'm using
5:47a mac 242 brush which is one of my absolute favorite go-to all over lid
5:52brushes i just think it's perfect
5:54it packs on pigments glitters metallics everything you can think of i just love
5:59this brush so much and I'm going to pack that on the entire lid from inner corner
6:04always outer corner kind of as a base for the glitter that we're going to go
6:07in with but first i'm going to go in with a gel liner and i'm going to be
6:11using color pop call me which is a dark brown kind
6:15of purple undertone and it's definitely a different color it's really pretty and
6:19i'm going to be doing just like a baby half wing today because I didn't want to
6:23leave the outer corner of my eye I totally blank but I didn't want to do
6:26something totally typical like always and do an intense thick black winged
6:30liner so I chose to do a dark brown and I thought that this dark brown was
6:34really pretty because it had some purple notes in it so it didn't just completely
6:38blend in with the rest of the look one hundred percent and i am doing like a
6:41baby half wing as opposed to doing a thick all over the lid wing
6:45I wanted to keep it just the outer corner and that way the glitter can kind
6:49of speak for itself and they're not both fighting for who's boss
6:52and then I'm gonna go in with obsessive compulsive cosmetics also known as OCC
6:56loose glitter in the shade coffee
6:58i'm going to be using it too faced shadow insurance glitter glue this
7:02glitter glue is hands down the best glitter glue if ever use I've tried so
7:05many from so many different cosmetic companies and this is my absolute
7:09favorite so you put the glitter glue all over your lid with the brush and then
7:13while it's still tacky
7:14you just go in and start packing on glitter and as you can see this is a
7:17loose glitter and I am barely getting any fallout whatsoever all my face
7:22if any like it really is the best glitter glue in the world I would never
7:27ever use anything else
7:29honestly especially if it's an occasion where you really don't want your glitter
7:32to be messy and you wanted to stay nice and perfect to face glitter glue is
7:36where its I'm telling you it is the bomb
7:39so using that same exact brush that I've used for everything else on the lid
7:43I'm just packing this glitter all over i want to make sure not to cover up my
7:46eyeliner on the outer corner and I want to grab some mac cosmetics reflex
7:51antique gold don't know why my face gets so splotchy
7:55I don't know I'm so sensitive you guys at my face is such a mess all the time
7:59and I'm just going to pack a little bit of that just in the center of the ideas
8:03for a little bit more dimension
8:05you really don't even notice that it's there it's just going to kind of make
8:08this one of your I pop a little bit more then I'm grabbing blinking butte lashes
8:12these are the style Samantha created Samantha's here on YouTube her name is
8:16Samantha with 3 s's and these lashes are beauti ful so I was pop some of those on
8:22and then i'm going to prime my face
8:25i am using the Becca back
8:27lighting filter or something this is the luminous fiber i'll link it down below
8:32I'm going to prime my entire face with that and i'm going to be going in with
8:35giorgio armani a luminous silk foundation one of my favorite
8:39foundations of all time and i am back to using a my morphe foundation brush brush
8:45this is the m4 39 brush
8:47I was on the artiste brush kick for a while which I still really love that
8:50brush but i have been back to this one the past couple of weeks i just love it
8:55it's one of those brushes that it's just it's always going to be there for you no
8:57matter what no matter what you go through no matter how bad times get that
9:01brush will always work I love it
9:03now i'm going to put on some urban decay naked skin concealer and I'm going to
9:08blend it out under my eye area i am using the new on kat von d & Beauty
9:12Blender collaboration which is why the Beauty Blender is black
9:16I think it's super cool even though you can see every little speck of concealer
9:20and Iran it's cool to see a black beauty blender and then I'm going to take that
9:24same concealer and put it down the center of my nose on my Cupid's bow and
9:27on my chin and i'm going to kind of just blend it out everywhere so that we have
9:32a nice highlighted center of the face as well because that under eye area was
9:35looking pretty white because my spray tan is very very orange you talk right
9:39now so I need to kind of even out the face then I'm going to grab Anasazi a
9:43banana powder and normally i mix this with some mac and the size but recently
9:48i have been loving just using this all by itself
9:51I feel like it makes my under eyes look better I feel like it kind of hides any
9:55creepy or dryness it really brightens it doesn't accentuate any like on like
10:00under eye lines or anything like that i love it
10:03now i'm going to be going in with giorgio armani powder
10:06I just discovered this like a week and a half ago and oh my god I why did I ever
10:13know about this powder before it is such a beautiful face powder so I'm going to
10:18lightly set my entire face with this powder that way i can go in with bronzer
10:22and everything will go on a nice and smooth
10:25I'm going to grab this color again that we use on the upper lid from the morphe
10:2935o palette using any pencil brush I'm going to begin to put this on the under
10:34eye area all the way from inner corner to outer corner but when I say in our
10:38corner
10:39I don't like to go too hard on
10:40inner tear duct because then it can start to look messy especially
10:43throughout the day so I don't bring it all the way and I kind of just go
10:47towards the inner corner and it kind of stopped right at that tier . if that
10:51makes sense
10:52these shots are terrible when i was adding this I was like I need to lower
10:55my camera
10:56this is such a mess and the facial expressions i make i just can't so right
11:00now i'm going with that same Natasha didn't own a shade and I'm just fucking
11:04that out and then I'm going to grab some black liner this is by ardency Inn I've
11:08said a million times this is the best black liner i've ever used on my
11:12waterline it doesn't move
11:14it's so creamy and easy to apply and then I'm going to grab a little bit of a
11:18black shadow on a definer brush and just stay right on that lash line and just
11:23wiggle back and forth so that it smokes out look at my mouth though
11:26honestly I'm like all up in your face pretty much out of focus of my mouth
11:30hanging open like could I really chocolate like get it together haven't
11:35you been doing this for like three years now four years come on
11:38reevaluate your life i am putting mascara on my lower lashes of course i'm
11:42using L'Oreal
11:44what is this l'oreal carbon black voluminous mascara that's what it is
11:48and then for brows i'm going to be using the Anastasia brow definer oh you guys
11:54are probably gonna get sick of me talking about this freaking product but
11:57honestly you guys
11:58it is so good like I don't even care it's getting to that point in our
12:02relationship
12:02I am loyal you'll be getting our invitations very soon the wedding is
12:06happening we are in a committed relationship
12:08so let's just move on I'm going to be bronze in my face using Mac give me son
12:12I just recently purchased this product again I was shopping on like mac
12:16cosmetics calm and I saw give me son and I'm like oh my gosh why have I not use
12:20this if you guys are watching my very first videos here on YouTube
12:23I went through probably five of these like this was my favorite bronzer of all
12:27time i've been using again this week and I'm like why did I ever stop using this
12:32bronzer it's so beautiful and i am using the mac 135 brush to apply it and then
12:37i'm going to do just a little bit of cooking and I'm going to use some are
12:40cma no color translucent powder i'm going to let this sit here for just like
12:44two minutes while I just run over my face with some other products so that
12:47it's not as sloppy as i just applied it
12:50i am putting some anastacio clear brow gel which is
12:53the gorilla glue a brow gel honestly it's the bomb and i'm taking a little
12:57bit more of a banana powder and just putting it on the center of my base my
13:01chin and just kind of running it over like the t-zone area cause I just felt
13:04like I wanted to be a little bit more defined that way the bronzer didn't like
13:08run over to the center of my face
13:10i'm going to go ahead and blend out that bacon if you will always the best
13:15feeling when you blend that out on your contour like in your bronzer just nice
13:18and sharp and clean like I swear I think that's my favorite part of doing makeup
13:21now for blush I'm going to go in with two Mac blushes this whole palette you
13:26see here is matte blushes
13:27I'm going to grab modern Mandarin such a tongue twister for me and copper tone
13:32and i'm going to mix those two together and then i'm going to put that on the
13:35apple of the cheeks going a backward towards the temple kind of blending in
13:39with the bronzer
13:41I didn't want to be too much on the apples of my cheeks though because then
13:43I can look I had a sunburn
13:44I'm trying to kind of angle it to the side and brush it back i'm going to use
13:48the charlotte tilbury bar of gold to highlight this is my first time using it
13:52and I think it's really really beautiful and for the brush I'm using the morphe
13:56am 310 fan brush i mentioned this in my favorites video i have been loving this
14:03recently to highlight with I just think that it makes it so easy and just
14:07distribute it evenly across your face I've really been loving it
14:10I'm gonna take a little bit that same highlight and put on my Cupid's bow and
14:14then it's time to go in with our lip
14:16i'm going to be using jeffree star dominatrix which is a very very deep
14:20dark brown
14:22it does have a red undertone in it which I really really like because there are a
14:26lot of different shades of dark brown out there
14:28this one definitely has a red undertone which I just think is really pretty and
14:32complement to look especially like this one
14:34not to mention jeffree star liquid lips are one of the best and my personal
14:38opinion
14:39I'm not a liquid lip fan overall but i do like Jeffrey
14:42so yeah after you apply that lip we are good to go so i hope you enjoy this

0:25collection i started pulling out my gold my glitters and I need to come up with
0:29this look at my mind and it was like gold foil glare on the lid and like a
0:32brown cut crease maybe with some purple smoke down underneath and an inner
0:36corner cat eye and I was like my creative juices were flowing at the mad

2:06guys like this video
2:08it is going to be a top through video today meaning i'm going to be talking to
2:11you and I'm applying my makeup as opposed to a makeup tutorial with a
2:15voice over so you guys at the style this video let me know and I will talk to
2:19incorporate more voice overs in the future so let's jump into it
2:23so we're going to be starting off with my skin today so I'm going to start by
2:26priming my face i'm going to be using the Makeup Forever skin equalizing
2:30smoothing primer so i'm going to be putting this where I have issues with
2:33pores because I don't all over my face and I really don't want this to matt
2:36face so only going to put it right on the nose in this cheek area because
2:40that's really where the poor issue 6 not for the rest of the face i'm going to be
2:43going in with the hourglass fail mineral primer this is oil free and I'm going to
2:48be applying this to the rest of the face where I did not apply on the smoothing
2:52primer right there in the center so I'm going to put this everywhere else and
2:57it's not necessary to use two primers obviously you can just use one but I'm
3:02happiness
3:03ok so now for foundation I'm going to be going in with the new
3:07L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion I'm so excited when I saw that lore'l was
3:11coming out with a new formula and the true max lumi meas True Match Lumi used
3:16to be like my my ride or die
3:19oh my god if you guys remember from back in the day I used that for a year
3:22straight i'm using the shade + 3.5 so the system is a little different because
3:26the original True Match Lumi I'm a w5 and this is n 3.5 so I don't know how it
3:32works exactly but it looks like this little cushion and then foundation comes
3:36out there also
3:37it's so cute I'm going to go in with a new brush my morphe I haven't tried
3:41yeah it's brand new and this is the e 50 for me to lead collection so it's a
3:46synthetic brush and literally just going to take a brush and put it straight in
3:50here
3:51hopefully I like this brush oh god I'm like okay wait to see the color my
3:55beloved I've gotten so pale the past couple of days because I've been
3:59exfoliating and all my tan is coming off and it says it's a buildable coverage
4:04but I honestly feel like this goes on
4:06initially as a medium to full coverage it's really easy to build it up see can
4:12you see how much is going on my face like it's full coverage i really have to
4:16like spread it around so that I don't get cake face and I were not found a
4:23shin i'm going to go in with concealer and I actually just got to New on Real
4:28Techniques Beauty sponges because my was getting so nasty and dingy and falling
4:32apart and i stopped me . amazonas they just got in the mail this morning so so
4:35happy so I just went and wet this one under the sink and it's so firm
4:40I was like oh that's what it's supposed to feel like I have totally forgotten
4:43um so I'm going to be going in with the new makeup forever concealer
4:47I don't know these are actually out yet they sent them to everyone on their PR
4:50lyst
4:51but there wasn't any note as far as the launch date or anything in the bag that
4:55came in so i'm using shade why 33
4:58so I'm just going to . it under my eye area like this if you're super creamy
5:04but it doesn't feel so thick that you're like oh this is not going to blend out
5:08like it feels really really creamy kind of slimy but very blendable it's super
5:14hydrating - it's not dry which is amazing
5:17so now it's going to take the damp Beauty Blender and i'm just going to
5:20blend this out
5:23I just bouncing up and down very quickly
5:26this is my favorite way to blend a concealer of all time is using any sort
5:31of damp sponge if you really dry on the under eye area a tip is to take some
5:36pics + from Mac like this and spread it on your damn
5:40under and then blend it out and that will make your concealer really really
5:45hydrating but because it has blisters and it will also help it stick to each
5:48other as well so if you suffer and struggle with super dry under eye area i
5:52would suggest using some mac fix+ on your beauty blender
5:56ok so now i'm going to set that and i'm going to kick it old school and have to
6:01kick it old school and I've been doing the same damn thing for the past year
6:04and a half but recently i've been using the laura mercier translucent powder and
6:08today I want to use the mac pro emphasize powder and the Anasazi of
6:12banana powder the nslc banana powder you can buy individually on her website and
6:17the mac pro and the size you can buy this on mac com or any post or I'm going
6:21to be using the morphe e 48th this is a new brush in your recollection
6:25I just got these yesterday and I haven't tried them yet so I'm just trying them
6:28now for the first time and then i'm going to just set that under my eye
6:35ok so not the face i'm going to spend it very lightly with a powder
6:38normally i would use the laura mercier well the laura mercier translucent
6:41powder but today I want to be as mad so I'm going to keep the old school using a
6:45demon mineralize skinfinish from Mac this is the shade medium is going to be
6:49using a big fluffy brush is the e34 morphy and i'm just going to get all up
6:55in there
6:56I'm just going to lightly set the face i'm not doing this for additional
6:59coverage mineralize skinfinish is very very light coverage so I'm just doing
7:03this simply just set the foundation in place so it doesn't run anywhere and
7:08this will make it really easy to blend products on the skin with bronzer and
7:11blush and highlight but this is not really going to get much coverage
7:15alright so now we're going to move on ties and I actually put a new lens on my
7:18camera today so look at what we can do
7:20all
7:21we can zoom in i normally film like a 50 millimeter lens so i can zoom into my
7:26eyes all the way and get closer but today gotten lensbaby so we're going to
7:31be able to finally zoom it
7:32ok so for the eyes I'm not gonna lie i'm challenging myself not to make a beat
7:37today because I always going to make a beat for this look especially i use the
7:41eyeshadow deserts and if you're a shot all time but today I'm going to branch
7:47out and use different brands so what
7:49let me see what i got here so I'm going to grab some shadows from the lorac Pro
7:53make it 2 palette i'm gonna start off with the shade right here called Tommy
7:57the third one in on the top row I'm going to take that and just dust it
8:01right there in the crease you guys know this process the transition color I'm
8:08going to not keep this precise really at all we're going to blend it out in this
8:12entire crease area and then once we don't have a type of product on the
8:16brush computer you put it there in the crease
8:18that's we're going to start working kind of upward just to make sure it's blended
8:21out in this entire brow bone area
8:24anything over here just going to go in and place that color initially right
8:27there in the pocket of my crease
8:29if you do not have a crease just create one
8:32just do this wherever you want to create a crease on your eye area if you have
8:36put it I just brings color up a little bit higher than your hood crease area if
8:41that makes sense
8:42it's a very important when you're blending your I try to not only going
8:45windshield wiper motions but also circular motion so I start off with
8:48windshield wiper and then I go in tiny little circular and I go back to
8:52windshield wiper and then I go circular that's really the key to getting an
8:56eyeshadow to blend is windshield wiper and circular a nice shadow color though
9:01like this ok so now i'm going to go in with my is not focusing
9:06now i'm going to go in with burlap right here which just had a little bit more of
9:10like a baby puke coloring do it with you know I all about that life
9:15i'm going to just layer that right on top of Tony the original quality when
9:21I'm with the exact same area is going to give it more dimension by layering the
9:25shades windshield wiper motions and then circular motions so it was kind of like
9:33put it on there like this kind of sloppy can see it really choppy and unblended
9:37and then we'll begin to do circular motions and windshield wiper
9:42just back and forth between those two motions
9:45we've got those two shadows on our eyes i'm going to grab the mac pro and
9:48besides shaping powder again that I used to set my under eye area in this time
9:52I'm going to put it on a eyeshadow brush my hair brush I'm going to grab this on
9:57a mac
9:58ok that's attractive I'm going to get this on a mac 242 brush just any flat
10:03synthetic eye shadow brush will work
10:05I'm going to get to pack this on the inner corner of the eye to make it nice
10:08and bright
10:09this powder is just so pigmented as you can see i love it so much for an
10:14eyeshadow i think it's so beautiful
10:16the great thing about it is that it's not frosty but it's not a full mass so
10:20it doesn't look chalky
10:22it hasn't a really beautiful natural sheen to it that's why it's so easy to
10:27apply and it looks so nice
10:30I'm just packing us on and just patting motions looking to make sure to bring
10:35this up in this area
10:37this will help open up the eyes more if you leave it just on the lid it kind of
10:41close the eyes
10:43but if you bring it up like this towards the bridge of the nose and towards the
10:47brow
10:47this will open your eye up i'm also going to take this and put it underneath
10:51the eye area and the inner tear duct area and make this nice and bright
10:58right here I'm doing this because we are going to go in
11:02and put some glitter liner in this area so I want this nice bright highlights
11:06too kind of shine through and make that glitter pop even more so that's why I'm
11:10pockets on the inner corner here because I now that we are very white eyed and
11:15right I'm going to just fill in my brows because it's a good time to do so
11:19I always start at the bottom of the ground to give it the shape that I want
11:22and I make sure to hold the pencil far down I never hold it up here otherwise
11:26it will make it really dark and intense i will it really lightly at the very
11:30bottom like a pencil and I just do light strokes to get the shape that I desire
11:37and then go from there
11:38I am constantly using the spoolie I cannot live without the spoolie I
11:45physically could not do my brows without this
11:47now i'm going to highlight my brow bone and i'm going to be using what do you
11:53know something better change i'm going to be using Mac nylon and i'm just going
11:57to strictly put it right at the tippy top part of the ground ball just like a
12:03little a little battle yeah i'm not going to drag it around and like blend
12:08it out otherwise it's just going to become too much too over-the-top to
12:12quickly so just right there at the high point
12:14so now i'm going to go in with my favorite Brown shadow right now and this
12:18is by anastacio is in the shade
12:20fudge I'm going to grab budge on a sigma e 15 which is just a flat definer brush
12:24I'm going to begin to press it really tightly into my lower lash line only
12:30strictly on the outer corner of the eye
12:33so we're just going to keep that like a super harsh line okay it doesn't look
12:40good right now but it will it's a process
12:42do not try to blend with a small precision brush like this one
12:47just pack it on there and make it harshly get sharp it's not going to look
12:49good but we will blend it out with a pencil brush I'm going to go back
12:54the same eyeshadow that I used on my upper lid i will grab you could grab
12:58Tony or burlap or any sort of warm round to use on your lid it does not matter
13:02either one of these will work
13:03I'm going to grab the burlap and just on the very tip of the brush
13:07this is the morphe e18 pencil brush and then i'm going to just put it directly
13:12over that fudge eyeshadow and just blend it in tiny little motions back and forth
13:19I'm kind of wiggling my brush downward so I'm kind of going like this and I'm
13:23going down like this because i personally love the look of a smoky
13:28lower lash line and the outer corner and when it's kind of brought down it really
13:32helps open up the eyes if your upper shadow was brought up your lower shot at
13:36shadows brought down on the outer corner
13:38it widens the eye and gives you a doe-eyed effect so that's what we're
13:42doing right now is we're opening the eye by dragging us down and out
13:47I need to do the no mirror makeup challenge I want her how bad I would
13:51suck at that because I don't look in the mirror a lot when I'm blending my lower
13:55lash line and i always think like I wonder how that I would do with that
13:58challenge i'm going to use the map , graphic pencil in the shade and see 15 /
14:04and w20 any cream eyeliner pencil will work
14:08I just don't want brown shadow in this water line
14:12I want it to be nice in wide-eyed
14:15ok next step is going to be applying lashes this is totally your call though
14:20you do not need to apply lashes for this look you could just do mascara and
14:24totally get away with it
14:25i'm going to apply lashes though because it's just going to add that extra
14:28glamour and it's very easy to apply lashes once you practice and get the
14:32hang of it you'll be able to pop them on like boom this is the Loreal voluminous
14:34carbon black such a good drugstore mascara so for lashes i'm going to be
14:39going in with on this legal actions by flutter these were limited editions
14:43they're no longer available what makes me so sad because they're like the most
14:47comfortable beautiful lashes everyone in my life they're extremely long though so
14:51I know that not everyone is going to like the drama
14:53these lashes on them personally like I do I'm just comfortable with myself and
14:57very dramatic lashes but I know that these are very over the top for a lot of
15:01people on it is important to find your lash and what works for you
15:06i always recommend the floor lashes whisper sweet nothings they are long
15:11so if you have small eyes or really hooded eyes you might not love them but
15:15they're so fluffy and girly and beautiful also the are dealt with speed
15:20and the drugstore those are great
15:22Vegas nay I know that she has some lashes that are so not at walgreens and
15:25alton and i have not tried them yet but I just order them online but I've heard
15:29great things about those and those are an expensive as well so there's so many
15:33great lash brands out there now it's just important to find like what style
15:37works best on you because we all have different styles so when I sit here and
15:40say oh my god I love this boss so much
15:42there's gonna be thousands thousands of people are going to hate it because it's
15:45not gonna look the same on my eyes that will on your we all have different
15:47shapes so please flutter please sheyla bring it back here so good
15:52I'm gonna pop these super duper close to the lash line and that's why my tweezers
15:59come in handy there are tools out there made for this aren't losers because
16:03these could definitely poke your eye out so I do not suggest going in with razor
16:06sharp tweezers on go in with an actual professional last tool but that's what
16:11they're so great for as you can get them so close to your actual lash line and
16:16not have any gaps or spaces
16:18I could never apply a lash without some sort of tweezer or tool like this is my
16:29secret to getting it so close to the lash line
16:32pop them what on I always start on the outer corner to make sure that that here
16:37is first and then I go in
16:39with the inner corner because the inner corner can always be a little bit testy
16:43here so i do the outer corner first just to make sure that we're all going to go
16:48alright so now we're going to move on and we're going to go in with some
16:50glitter liner
16:51we are going to be using the Urban Decay heavy metal glitter like glitter liner
16:55this is my absolute favorites glitter liner of all time
16:59so all I'm gonna do is line directly over where we put that white on the
17:03under eye area so i'm going to start on the inner corner and i'm going to get
17:06really so make sure that you don't do your mask area you need to do this with
17:10no mascara on the lower lashes and i'm going to get super duper tight to the
17:15waterline and just begin to stroke glitter on that area
17:20if you have mascara on at this point you're going to completely ruin it and
17:22get glitter all over your mascara so make sure you do this first
17:28I just start on the very inner porter and then I just drag you do not put on
17:39your waterline you don't want to put any inner rim you just want to put it on the
17:43skin right voice right underneath of the water line on the lash line
17:51ok so once you know that you are totally done applying glitter and that's when
17:54you can apply mascara to your lower lash line but i would not apply mascara until
17:59you know for a fact that you're done with your glitter otherwise you can just
18:02get messy and not have that clean look that we're going for
18:05i'm going to be using the volume mascara about having a quantum my mom squares is
18:08mascara so like let's give it a try and see what she's hiding up about
18:18trying so hard not to make my ugly face because whatever i apply mascara on like
18:21where is my sculpting powder ok so i'm going to be using Mac shade start today
18:29shade sir is actually permanent item at the mac pro store so you can get it on
18:33mac.com i believe and at any pro store
18:35it comes in a little individual pan like this its magnetic map shade started my
18:40favorite contour like all time I think it is such a good shade kind of want to
18:45try this brush for contouring I'm really scared of it I haven't used this before
18:49I kind of think that this could be cool
18:52this is the morphe e 58 brush so I'm going to try this for the first time for
18:56a contouring powder so since i haven't used it yet i'm going to get nice and
18:59dirty and rough I'm going to get a lot of product on there and then went to
19:02dust it out this is how I always go in with a brush for the first time and then
19:06I'll kinda like rub it on a paper towel beat it up a little bit the process I
19:09gotta show this bitch who's boss
19:31ok so because this brush to not make my contour on like precise and sharp i am
19:38going to just quickly do a little baking
19:40the only thing I ever do Scott that my face just bake away
19:55so I'm going to dust that off to clean up the lower half of the face and make
20:02it look much smoother more put together for blush I'm going to go in with this
20:09mix blush in the shade coral dream just like this
20:12Knicks have great blushes I love their blushes are very pigmented and they're
20:17very inexpensive which is just a bonus is going to pick that up and just go in
20:25short stroke emotions now for highlight i'm going to be going in with Bobby
20:34Brown bronze glow
20:36I'm not going on sheriff a paucity which is very hard for me because we actually
20:40look freaking course with this look
20:41but that's okay i'm going in with bronze glow because i'm trying not to you
20:46champagne pop so much even though it's my baby
20:57it drives me so crazy that my highlight looks like that on camera because I'm
21:01person as looks completely different person my highlight looks so smooth and
21:05blend it and then on camera
21:07it looks chunky and glittery and creepy and like clockwork almost every single
21:12time I need a subscriber you guys always Tony and my makeup looks a better person
21:16than it does on camera and I'm like why I need to figure out my lighting game
21:21but I mean I don't I do it all on my own like I don't have anyone to help me with
21:25my writing anything you like
21:27hire professionals to ask them like what I'm doing wrong because this is not the
21:32same
21:32oh ok so now for lips i'm going to be going in with her red
21:36um i have worn the captain lights for the night several times
21:41this is her collaboration with over cosmetics for a second liquid will be
21:44it's absolutely amazing the formula so beautiful
21:46it's nice and moisturizing it's not too dry and the color is gorgeous but today
21:51I'm going to go in with a true red
21:53this is ho ho ok just whatever ho ho
21:57by jeffree star so i'm going to be going in with this one I haven't used the
22:01shape yes i'm really excited to see it is liquid lipsticks they're so nice out
22:05of the password packaging their high-quality he is just awesome i love
22:08him
22:14it's serious it takes me it's such a long time to apply liquid lipstick or
22:17line my lips because my lips are naturally so on
22:21even like one side goes straight down and the other side is rounded and in
22:25this side goes straight down and then this side is so much like fatter and
22:30have it more meat in it my lips are so out of proportion I've always wanted to
22:34get lip filler to balance them out like temporary lip filler to see if it would
22:38look better but I don't kind of scares me but maybe one day but for now that's
22:43when they get this for last but not least I'm going to get a quick spritz of
22:48the indicator makeup setting spray to my face and we'll all right so here we have
22:55the finished look
22:56I actually just talk a little bit of gloss on my lips this is the Anasazi I
23:00Beverly Hills runway red lip gloss I just thought i would put it on so I
23:04never ever too glossy bold lips I'm very uncomfortable with it so i thought why
23:08not step out of my comfort zone and try a little ghouls
23:11um keep in mind that for this look you do not have to use false lashes if
23:15you're not comfortable false lashes if you never do saw flashes you do not need
23:19false lashes to complete this look just coating your own lashes with some
23:22mascara and giving them a curl will be more than enough
23:25the thing that really makes this look glamorous and festive is definitely the
23:29gold glitter liner and the bold red lips combined so I really hope that you guys

0:20when I had my Rihanna inspired makeup look a while back i asked you guys what
0:23celebrity would like to see next and hands down kylie jenner to the cake
0:27the reason it's taking me so long to get around to building this tutorial is
0:30because for the last couple of months i have actually been formulating a
0:33lipstick inspired by kylie jenner her lip color is just like crazy in the
0:38makeup world and the beauty industry people are just loving that the color
0:41and going bonkers over and so many people have been asking me what little
0:45combination i think it is what color I think it is and I thought to myself you
0:48know what I'm gonna figure this out
0:50so let's create one that's exactly what I did I tend to withdraw automatic and
0:53we created a kind of general inspired lip color
0:56I did the entire process I was so thinking about the formulation I was so
1:00good about the color that's why it took me such a long time and so so happy to
1:03introduce this color to you guys

1:38literally went to Instagram and stop this girl like boom screenshot probably
1:4230 pictures

2:23lipstick that I created thanks so much for watching this video and if you want
2:26to see you how to get this kylie jenner inspired makeup look
2:29then just keep watching bye guys
2:34i'm going to be using that whole lot more concealer to prime my eyes in the
2:37shade nw20 i'm going to go in with makeup geek purely naked who looks like
2:43this has just a little bit of sugar in it not too much though where it's not
2:46going to get in the way we're blending in our crease
2:48- very useful neutral brown color I'm going to take on a Bigfoot fluffy brush
2:52this is a e 40 from sigma i'm going to dust that in my crease area
2:56i'm also the resume you it because let's get real
2:59I know you want to see this bad boy up close yeah I am initially when i pick up
3:06that pigment starting on the outer edge so that that is the most intense and
3:09once there's not much product on the brush
3:11I'll bring it in work so this color is light i'm just going to blend it upward
3:19towards that brow area but i do not have very much and I rushed right now I'm
3:24just blending so we don't have any
3:25any harsh lines i am going to go in with a more d eyeshadow in the shade number
3:3162 it looks like this it is not a really warm or really cool eyeshadow it's right
3:36in between so it's a nice neutral shade and i love the tone of it is it's got
3:40some depth so we're going to take that on a smaller more precise timing brush
3:43and we're going to put that in the full crease area and yes these are more the
3:48eyeshadows the ones i was talking about my last video there are only two dollars
3:50a pop
3:51yes please so I'm going to start this outer corner I'm going to push it in
3:55that area and i'm going to bring around all the way about right here i'm not
4:01gonna bring it all the way and i'm going to bring it about right there and then
4:04blended back and forth on the actual lip because at this point i'm only working
4:12in the crease on the actual lid
4:14you can really just kind of bring this down however you want but I don't want
4:17the lid to be as dark as the crease area i want the main product to be right here
4:23in this section and then a little bit can come down this little area that's
4:27fine
4:29ok now I'm going to clean brush this isn't a 25 from sigma and then just with
4:35absolutely no products on it go over that entire crease area because we need
4:40to lend
4:47so now i'm going to go in and do my eyeliner and i'm going to use Maybelline
4:50eye studio gel liner in the shade black black I'm going to use an e 65 right by
4:55mu by Sigma this is my favorite eyeliner brush and just the perfect all angles
5:00nice and petite
5:01so what kinda typically does her eyeliner and she does a little wing and
5:04then she keeps it nice and bold on the outer corner and then trimmed it down
5:07really quickly and it ends right in this area where the eyelashes start to thin
5:12out so i'm going to show you exactly how to do that and what you're going to
5:15start with is the inner corner you're going to trace it right along the
5:18eyelashes i do much can't talk while I'm doing this because I'm talking my eyes
5:21moving it has to be really precise so i'll see you in a show you
5:33ok so as you can see i have literally just like dab right at the lash line and
5:38all i have created is just the finish line ever on my lash line and you
5:42honestly can't really tell that huge difference from the side to that I
5:46that's what we're going to start off with
5:47and now we're going to create the wing and once we follow it and we connect it
5:51to this little line that we have it will come together beautifully
5:54let's hope and I do have an eyeliner video that's kind of old something
5:58walking through this right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to follow the
6:01bottom lash out of my I up to towards the corner of my eye brow write like
6:05this and that is going to be the exact line i'm going to draw for my little
6:09wing them doing
6:17just like that so that line literally it goes from bottom lash line towards the
6:22brow
6:22that's exactly how you follow that and then if you do that on both eyes
6:27your wings will always be even so now i'm going to go ahead and connect the
6:31dots
6:57i'm going to be using the last of the Rimmel lash accelerator this is my
7:00favorite drugstore mascaras and I really really like it to curl my lashes before
7:03i go in with false lashes
7:05just because i think it makes a nice and long and separated and your lashes don't
7:09get in the way of your falsies sometimes using these two volumizing your lashes
7:13they can be too chunky and they can really stand out laying against your
7:17balls lashes so literally cannot decide which one should I want to wear these
7:21are both from house of lashes this one is called Bambi and these are called
7:24siren and I love them both and i do not know which one I want to do
7:28I'm kind of leaning towards Bambi ok so i have decided on Bambi my gosh these
7:37are so much
7:38fine all I'm doing is going out with the same gel liner that using the first
7:45place
7:46I'm just going over the band of that latches to cover it up I never liked to
7:49see the band of my false lashes
7:51even though it's obvious these are false I don't make them look even more faults
7:55and they need to look in the first place
7:56if you notice it so now i'm going to move arms my skin
7:59Kylie usually seems to have renounced looking is getting you know it's obvious
8:03that she's wearing foundation she's just not kicking it on and she typically is
8:06all mad that's something that I've noticed about her look is it is very
8:10rare that she does any sort of highlight the only highlight she will do is I can
8:14under i highlight with her concealer but it's still mad
8:17so I wanted to do a foundation that is not going to be doing whatsoever or give
8:21me a glow and make it forever is that foundation for me
8:24if your oily make it forever is going to probably make you a little doing but
8:26since I'm already so dry
8:28this is not going to make me look do you whatsoever i'm gonna look completely
8:31matte foundation will go sweets color so it works good
8:36I'm really going to spread this all over my face so that it's not too heavy so
8:46I'm going to a light application a foundation you can totally see my skin
8:50on
8:51using the camera but I can still see my little freckles and my blemishes but now
8:54i'm going to go in with nars radiant creamy concealer
8:58i'm using the shade custard and i'm going to apply this under my eye area
9:03i'm going in with a damn you wonder it's gonna make you more sure
9:16okay i'm going to just set that under eye concealer i'm going to be using the
9:20Anasazi of banana shade from her contour palette and I'm also been using mac and
9:24besides as always mix those together before this look I'm mainly using the
9:29anastacio banana shades and i'm just going to set this entire under eye area
9:34ok so now i'm going to go ahead and fill in my brows normal i am not in any way
9:39to try to replicate or duplicate had dinners I drive you completely different
9:44browse and i'm not going to go to come that road so I'm going to fill them in
9:46like I normally would
9:47one brown John wanted to go ok so now i'm going to shade mylar by Mac it looks
9:54like this right here
9:56it's a really really light shade have a pearlescent to it
9:59it's not shimmer and not Sparkle were just as a nice lean to it it just kind
10:04of reflects the light it's hard to explain it's a beautiful color very very
10:08neutral basic i'm going to use this to highlight underneath the brow bone
10:12because whatever she is using up there is extremely natural pretty much like
10:17she is nothing but i can see there's a little something
10:20i'm going to use that same I large touch on that inner corner for a really
10:26natural inner corner highlight i'm going to take a touch of black
10:33i'm using make a geek corrupt and I using i'm going to eat 15 black liner
10:38brush by Sigma i'm going to take this on that outer corner right here and match
10:43it up to that wing wire that we did earlier and just press it into that lash
10:48line only in the outer corner like that
10:54I'm going to go back with more key eyeshadow in the shade 62
10:57i'm going to use that to blend out this under eye area
11:03I'm going to buff that back and forth
11:11i'm going to be doing is bronze in my face because she really doesn't do much
11:15blush for faces look very natural just a little bit of color is touching the skin
11:19so i'm going to be using agar lactic map bronzer and shade Cabo start blending
11:25you
11:25I have never used this product before so this has been my first we'll see how it
11:29goes
11:32oh my god this bronzer is Georgina
11:40oh and the brush I'm using to apply this is by tom for I I can't talk about it

11:48i bought it anyways now I'm in love
11:50it was an impulse purchase and I'm sorry so last but not least we get to move on
11:54to the famous kylie jenner lip color and like I mentioned the beginning of the
11:57video i did create a lipstick inspired by the general lip color

12:09me
12:10- mom - Rosie Super Bowl i'm going to put on right now for you guys without
12:13any lip liner

13:31or dark eyeshadow something that matters have any shimmer on a blending brush and
13:35then just lightly put it underneath that bottom one just ever so slightly and
13:42that bring it down a little bit now that we don't watch on a rock brush and that
13:49creates a natural shadow making it look like that bottom lip is kind of folding
13:53over and make that a little slumber

14:06watching
0:00hey guys so today I'm going to be doing this natural glam makeup look for you
0:19and what I mean by natural lamb is we are going to be working with all neutral
0:22tones but it is still a glamorous look so this is a full face of makeup it is
0:27not like a five-minute natural makeup when you're running out the door
0:29it is a full face but instead of focusing on like dramatic winged liner
0:33or intense contour
0:34we're really going to be focusing on keeping everything soft and feminine and
0:37blurred out the point of this look is to really make it look like you are just
0:40glowing from within and just enhancing your natural beauty
0:45this is very on trend right now you see tons of celebrities wearing this look
0:48and tons of celebrity makeup artist wearing and doing this look right now so
0:51i just wanted to make a video showing you how you can achieve it for yourself
0:54every single person watching this video can do this look and it will look good
0:57on you and I can promise you that
0:59and it is so easy to achieve anybody can do this
1:02so I really hope that you enjoy this video as always i love you guys so much
1:06and I'll be seeing you soon
1:11all right guys the first thing I'm doing is throwing my hair up so that we are
1:15not distracted by it hanging all in my face
1:18we are going to be starting off with the skin today so i am going to prime my
1:21face using L'Oreal magic Lumi this is a light diffusing primer and went to warm
1:26it up on my fingertips and pressed it into my skin
1:29pressing primer and your skin will help with the longevity and make it work much
1:33better then we're going in with lush feeling younger this is a skin tent
1:38it is absolutely beautiful full it reflects light in all the right ways you
1:43can put on before foundation during foundation or after
1:46oh we are absolutely in love so i'm going to apply this all the cheekbones
1:50some of the forehead and chin
1:53wherever you want light to reflect then we are going in with a new foundation
1:58you guys are actually the ones who told me that i need this in my life and you
2:01are correct
2:02so this is the Chanel left Lumiere it is such a beautiful medium to full coverage
2:05foundation and i'm going to use as always my Sigma f80 kabuki brush and as
2:11you can see i am pressing this into the skin
2:14once again like we press the primer into the skin this will just help it lasts
2:17the longest and will give a nice dewy glow so just pressing all over the face
2:22as you can see it's a little bit darker but it does match my neck which is what
2:26I want to match then we are going in with mac pro longwear concealer and i'm
2:31using shape and w20 i'm just going to dab this on the skin with my fingers
2:36going all the way back toward the temple area and then grabbing the sigma f 86
2:41brush and blending this out
2:43this is not technically a concealer brush but I just recommend everyone uses
2:46it for concealer because it is absolutely beautiful
2:49don't forget to also run over the eyes to prime the eyes for the shadow that we
2:53will be going in with I also slightly go over my eyebrows it doesn't really
2:57matter but it can help to prime the eyebrows as well
3:00speaking of brows boom done I did use the anastacio caramel and ash blonde to
3:07fill in and then I'm going to go and sculpt again with that mac pro longwear
3:10concealer i will put my full brow tutorial down below in the description
3:15bar as always for you
3:16I just like stopped in my brows out
3:18like the way it looks just having a little bit more defined and other
3:21intense right now but it will all work out using the anastacio contour contour
3:25kit in the banana shade
3:27we're already hit pan and the mac pro emphasize powder
3:31what can i say some things never changed i'll be using this powder forever
3:34using the Sigma taper highlighting brush I'm going to dab
3:37as you can see literally dabbing motions I really prefer dabbing when i'm setting
3:42my concealer as opposed to rubbing and sweeping it really presses the powder
3:46into the skin and keep the concealer in place all day long I've never had an
3:51issue with my concealer breaking up at all then going in with the mac
3:56this is mac mineralize loose powder who can remember that for a second
4:01i'm going to just dab this almighty zone because i have an issue with my makeup
4:04breaking up in my t zone because I make so many facial expressions
4:08who would have thought then I'm going to kick it old school and use mac soft
4:12brown today for my eyes
4:13i'm going in with a sigma e40 brush which is just a big fat blending brush
4:17and I'm going all the way from inner corner to outer corner
4:21as you can see i'm not putting it all over the lid I am starting deep down the
4:25crease and working my way up
4:27so we're just going to blend blend blend and don't forget to practice patience
4:31while blending because it's definitely going to come in handy
4:34so just keep going all the way from air corner and our corner making it as dark
4:38as you please
4:38I've also done this look using a bronzer instead of an eye shadow and it's just
4:42as beautiful
4:43then we're going with mac texture its a Mac day what can i say who . for me for
4:48that right I'm going again and inner corner and the outer corner as you can
4:52see i'm leaving the ball of the eye
4:54blank you don't have to you can just continue to get this all over the eyelid
4:59but i'm just leaving the center of my eye with not much on it just focusing on
5:03the inner and outer corner and then make sure you go back and blend that out once
5:08again against again
5:10blend blend blend blend blend then we are going in with becca highlighter in
5:17opal
5:18haha I've been seeing the praises of this highlighter for a while now i just
5:22love it
5:23you can use any brush I'm using them
5:24- 52 brush tapping this all over the center of that lid which is why I left
5:28it blank and then as you come to the outer parts just start to lightly blend
5:33it out word once you don't have as much payment on that brush using mac fix plus
5:37i'm going to just dampen the brush to make it more intense
5:41you can use eye drops for this water won't really work but I drops will you
5:45can wet any shimmery eyeshadow
5:47max don't work but any shimmery eyeshadow will become more metallic and
5:51give more of a finish or a foiled application when you wet it with 6 plus
5:54i'm sadly not right on the center
5:57just for a little bit more intensity than going in with mac nylon such a
6:02beautiful highlight it's a yellow base make sure you are right handed with it
6:05because it is a very very intense highlight but as you can see it's
6:09absolutely gorgeous
6:11so just a tiny bit will go a very long way you can see i absolutely love love
6:16love this highlight and I'm going to curl my lashes very lightly and yes very
6:21lightly because we are going to use false lashes so you want to make sure
6:25that curl is not too intense
6:26otherwise it's going to be very hard to get false lashes on i am putting a coat
6:31of giorgio armani eyes to kill this is still my sample size , himself says i
6:36love it
6:37then we are going to pop on a pair of lashes these are bias quito they are
6:42mean clashes which looks so natural beautiful it is not always easy to wear
6:46false lashes without eyeliner but if you get it close enough to that lash line
6:50and you're very patient
6:51you can do it and it will look beautiful as you can see I'm squeezing just to
6:55make sure that there's no separation and boom
6:57beautiful just make sure that you get those tweezers in there and really
7:02squeeze that fall / with that natural lash obviously be aware of your skin but
7:07it will just keep it super super low so that you don't have any separation
7:11between your naturals and your falsies then we are going to just go in with any
7:16pencil brush and blending texture underneath that island
7:19starting in the outer corner i always like to start in the outer corner
7:22because i like the most intensity to be in the outer corner
7:25if you don't want the most intense thing at a corner you can start in the inner
7:27corner just once again
7:29don't forget to blend so many clients for the past few years have always had
7:33issues with their under eye area because they just don't like to spend time under
7:37blending so just don't give up keep blending back and forth constantly and I
7:42was going in with a smaller more precise brush just putting more of that texture
7:45shape just more densely up in those lashes just to fill them in so there's
7:49no gaps or separation then in the inner corner going in with nylon again just
7:54highlight you can see this highlight is moving so we have the highlight on the
7:59inner corner
8:00follow the eye and on the brow bone so those three areas of highlight on the I
8:04really are very flattering on everyone
8:06then going in with nar's long wearing eyeliner and rue bonaparte which is this
8:11beautiful nude that I go back to every single spring and summer
8:14i'm going to just line my waterline i'm not going to show you me doing this for
8:18a very long time
8:19just because my allergies have been off the chain and my eyes are so red right
8:24now I really don't watch myself to this forever either moving on we're going to
8:28just mascara the lower lashes and I feel like it's very important to put on a
8:32generous amount of mascara on the lower lashes when doing a look like this with
8:36a nude liner and the waterline and false lashes and sneeze them eyeliner ruined a
8:43whole sad day
8:45so i'm going to show you how we can clean this up wait about 40 to 60
8:49seconds and then get a q-tip and just wipe and literally it will just come off
8:53like a chalkboard like it never even happened
8:56do not try to take off any one mascara or eyeliner wait until it's dry then
9:00going on with Studio care blend pressed powder this is in shade medium deep
9:04because I'm pretty fair right now I'm going to grab a big that brush
9:09I don't know the number of this one I will listed below for you and I'm going
9:12to bronze the face we are not doing any contouring we are just bronzing but it's
9:17pretty much the exact same thing is contouring just not precise so we're
9:20just going to bronze the cheeks right underneath the cheekbone area on the
9:23temples around the forehead bottom part of the chin
9:27we just want to give a really beautiful sunkissed glow to the entire face
9:30make sure you don't put a lot on your forehead or knows you want to leave that
9:33area blank so just the outer
9:35part then kicking it old school going in with mac peaches blush if you guys have
9:41been a loyal follower of mine from the beginning
9:44you know I used to be obsessed with matt peaches I actually think I've gone
9:47through three of these blushes which is the most i've ever gone through a blush
9:51all my years working at mac i put this on everyone who walked into the store
9:55so I'm going to blend this with a mac 129 into my bronzer going backward
10:00even though it doesn't even though it doesn't have a sheen or shimmer in it
10:03it really gives a beautiful glow to the face compliments so many people
10:08everyone thinks it looks scary in person until you put it on it is such a
10:11gorgeous color I use it every spring and summer
10:15moving on going back with the Bekaa highlighter and opal we are going to use
10:20be Sigma taper highlighter brush once again and just dust this all over the
10:25top of that cheekbone bringing up to the side kind of by the eyebrow that will
10:29get a really beautiful glow especially when you're turning your face from side
10:33to side make sure that you do a light amount of this you do not want to be too
10:38generous with this because it is a very intense highlighter and it on the chin
10:43Cupid's bow and of course in the center of that knows you do not have to do all
10:47that if you don't look super glowy but I love lighting up like a disco ball
10:50then we're going in with anastacio clear brow gel just so that are brown hairs
10:54are not flapping all over our face throughout the day because my will fall
10:57and look a hot mess and there's this there's just nothing worse
11:01ok really first world problems then we're going to go in with mac Japanese
11:05maple i am using all my old staples today I just love love this color it is
11:10such a beautiful nude and you can finish it like this and just do a super new lip
11:14which of course totally gorge
11:16but instead we are going to go on top of that with the new mac mineralize gloss
11:20and be nice
11:21which is such a pretty coral rosy shade
11:26I absolutely love these formulas they're such great losses so just mixing that is
11:30going to be a nice glossy nude coral shade absolutely perfect
11:35so that completes our look I hope you guys enjoy thank you so much for
11:39watching i love you all so much and I'll see
0:11hello my love
0:15today's video isn't making sure how many lives are going to change before
0:19embarrassing myself in front of thousands of people moving a lot
0:22today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look that i am wearing
0:25right here and I'm super excited for today's video because it isn't all
0:28affordable makeup look which I am very very excited about the only thing that I
0:34kind of skipped over was the brows i use the Anasazi of Broadway's but I figured
0:38you guys would forgive me because you know how it is with the brows it's like
0:41don't mess with the brown
0:43I saw recently a ton of requests on like two videos ago for an affordable or
0:48drugstore makeup look
0:49so I was like let's do it i also saw your quest incorporating cool tones into
0:54a smoky eye
0:54so we did that as well which is very outside of my comfort zone let me just
0:58say when I was going in with the cool tones in my crease like because I always
1:02work with neutrals or warms all myself because I just don't love cool tones on
1:07me but I actually do like this look right now I really like how it turned
1:11out so I am comfortable with this
1:13and i also saw a time of you guys asking for me to work with the jaclyn hill
1:17favorites palette that I design with more feet last December so I thought I
1:21would bring that back for this video
1:23so we're doing cool toward the jackal favorites palette and we're doing an
1:27affordable look at one video so I'm trying to me as many requests as
1:30possible
1:31if you don't own this palette don't worry they sell the shadows individually
1:35for two dollars a piece so I will go ahead and list them down below for you
1:38guys at which ones i am using so if you do want to purchase these you can go
1:41ahead and purchase the exact same colors that are in this palette for yourself
1:45online so don't feel like left out because you don't have this gallery
1:48thing like that you know saying I also want to say really quickly that i use in
1:52the elf blush palette today for the first time ever a subscriber recommended
1:56this me so I immediately went out and bought it a couple of days ago and you
1:59guys have seen me use this palette which is the morphe 9b palette I
2:04I love this palette I don't just love this palette for its affordability
2:08I can't look at this palette say oh yeah it's good for the price like no this
2:11palette is just good like these blushes are good they're pigmented their
2:15blendable they're soft I love them but i wanted to try something different today
2:18because I just got these a couple days ago and I was really excited to try them
2:22i will say they're just as pigmented as the morphe brushes
2:25the only difference is the more key ones have a little bit more blendabilities
2:29there a little bit creamier but other than that they had the same pigment on
2:33so the more he was gonna be easier to work with but still if you're looking
2:35for a great inexpensive blush palette to grab at your local drugstore this alpha
2:40one was really good i just want to mention that before jumping into the
2:43video because this was my first time using this and so that's like my little
2:46baby mini review on it i hope you guys enjoy this video and if you do get a big
2:51thumbs up and please subscribe
2:53i love you guys so much you know i mean it and i'll see you soon alright so
2:58first thing we're going to do today is prime our face
3:00i'm using the Loreal light infusing a primer this is my favorite drugstore
3:04primer because i am very dry so this helps give me like a radiant glow to the
3:09skin and makes the foundation glide on just a little bit easier and today for
3:13foundation I'm going to be mixing the original Lori true
3:16l'oreal true match and the L'Oreal True Match Lumi i'm using shade w4 and both
3:20foundations the original one is just a little bit too dry for me but the
3:24looming one can be very luminous so I want to mix them together to kinda get
3:28the best of both worlds
3:29so I am using a more p.m. for 39 foundation brush as always to blend this
3:33into the skin and this is a very affordable foundation brush as well if
3:37you're looking for a good one this one is bomb
3:40now i'm going to going in with concealer and i am using the Maybelline master
3:44concealer i really really like this concealer
3:48I am blending it out with a real techniques sponge which is basically the
3:52same thing as a Beauty Blender but again it's more affordable and i love this
3:55I've been choosing it over my beauty blender for the past month
3:58it's super big one side having a flat side and the other side is like a point
4:01is you can really get up in the corner of your eyes and blend everything out so
4:05fat and squishy and i love it
4:08now i'm going to go in with a next highlight and contour kit
4:12and i'm going to be using a more p.m. for 38 brush to use these two middle
4:17shades together on the under eye area just to set my concealer i normally use
4:21the anastacio powder and the map emphasize but these do the exact same
4:25thing and they did a great job so I'm just going to be blending that out on
4:29the entire under eye area and then i will also put that on the island as well
4:33so that my shadows blend a little bit better now i'm going to be going in with
4:36the morphe jaclyn hill favorites palette which is so like awkward to say that but
4:40anyways i am using this kind of medium tone warmish neutral brown that you saw
4:46all the way to the left side the palette i will put the exact numbers and names
4:49down below for you guys if you don't own this palette and i am using a sigma e40
4:53to dust this all over in the crease area
4:56I like to initially go in with a neutral or a warm shade because if I go in was
4:59just nothing but cool colors you can sometimes look like I've been punched in
5:03the eye
5:04so I always like to start with kind of a peachy warm or neutral base to blend
5:08everything out and then pack on the cool shade on top of that i'm going to go in
5:13with the first cool tone brown right here and I'm going to be using a what is
5:17this more fee and 433 brush to apply this in my crease area
5:21I'm going to go all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner I'm
5:24going to keep this as low as possible because again i do want to bring this
5:28too high up
5:29because that's when you're i can start to look a little bruise when working
5:32with cool tones so I keep this really low and that crease as you can see i'm
5:35really hollowing out back and forth and then once there's less product on the
5:39Block brush i will begin to blend upward in that warm color to kind of combine
5:44the both of them into a neutral shade
5:46now i'm going to go in with an even duck cool tone brown which is the one right
5:50next to the one that we just picked up and using the exact same brush I'm going
5:53to do the same step right in the crease of my eye I'm going to go back and forth
5:56and really carve out this crease area if you do not have a defined crease and
6:01that's okay you can create one and do the same step and full people that you
6:05have a deep set crease even if you don't that's the beauty of makeup
6:09if i seemed distracted or i'm laughing I'm looking around I'm talking it's
6:12because my mom is in the room she was on the phone and she had on speaker so i
6:15could be a part of the conversation but I'm like I'm still filming
6:18even if you're going to be behind the camera so that's why I seem a little
6:21distracted at times anyways once you don't have as much product on you
6:25brush you want to blend upward that is like the biggest part and blending out
6:29your shadow and making it really seamless
6:32now we're going to grab the shade right next to those are the two Browns that
6:34we've been using this whole time which is kind of a neutral kind of cool tone
6:39sandy brown that's how I'm describing it and any synthetic brush will do to pack
6:44this on the lid
6:45i'm going to go over a couple of times to really make that color a little bit
6:48brighter
6:49if you want to spray your brush with some fix+ that would be great
6:52you want to I actually tried spreading my brush with the law real makeup
6:55setting spray and it just was not having it at all it was not it didn't have
7:00glitter in it so it wasn't really sticking and giving that metallic look
7:03but you could use eye drops and that would also wet your brush and it would
7:06give it a little bit more sticking power if you want your eyes to really listen
7:10so now i'm going to go in with lore'l smoldering eyeliner
7:13this is a creamy Cole liner and i am going to just put this all over the lash
7:17line as you can see I'm not really trying to make it perfect but I want to
7:21keep it more on the thin side and right on the lash line and then I'll take any
7:25sort of small definer brush and just very lightly kind of smoke that out i
7:29don't want to be too smoky though
7:31but i just wanted to be a soft liner not to black not too intense not too smoky
7:34which is a little bit of definition on the lashes so that we don't leave the
7:38lash line completely blank but I didn't want to do like a dramatic cat I today
7:42now i'm filling in the brows as always and I am just using the Anasazi or
7:46browse in the shade hope I tried the I think it's by NYX the NYX brow pencil I
7:52think maybe was NYC and it was just so hard to use I just stuck with the
7:56Anastasio one that one which is super dry i don't know if i got like a dud and
8:00if they're usually good but it just wasn't working for me so I just stuck to
8:03what I know so that I didn't mess up his eyebrows
8:07so I go a lot lighter on the inner corner and then I go much heavier on the
8:10outer tail and I just blend it all out with the spoolie now we're going to go
8:14in with lashes and i'm using house of lashes in the style
8:18siren these are very fluffy and I refer to them as daytime lashes but for some
8:23they are not daytime lashes but they're very fluffy and very beautiful without
8:28being really over the top and dramatic
8:30so I am using the Loreal voluminous mascara and carbon black and I'm only
8:34putting this mascara on the very base of the
8:37ashes and the reason I do this is because it really helps blend the lashes
8:40with your fake ones but at the same time I don't want to take it up all the way
8:45out all the lashes because it can really kill the longevity of wearing these
8:48lashes multiple times not to mention it can make them look noticeably fake so i
8:52just do it at the very root and base of the lashes
8:55now i'm going to mix the two highlighting shade from this palette 1
8:59it has a little bit of a pinky undertone and the other one has a little bit of a
9:02yellow undertone so I mix them together to make it a little bit more neutral and
9:05using any synthetic brush just pop this at the high point of the brow bone and
9:09then blend it down along the tale of the brow
9:12if you want more of a natural daytime look you can skip this but you know me
9:15I'm always going to add the drama for you so that you can see how it looks now
9:18using the same a l'oreal smoldering eyeliner I'm just going to align my
9:22entire water line because we are going to smoke this out a little bit and once
9:26I've done that I'm going to go in with this really super dark brown has a
9:29little bit of a purple undertone in it for the lower lash line any definer
9:33brush i'm just going to pack this really tightly up against that lower water line
9:38so that the black liner and this doc brown can kind of mix together and
9:42become its own little special cocktail and then using a pencil brush I'm going
9:45to blend out the whole lower lash line all the way back and forth
9:48i always suggest putting a light brown shade on the pencil brush because it'll
9:52really help get that lower lash line nice and seamlessly blended and then
9:56basic where it's going to go in and apply some mascara to the lower lashes
10:00again i am using the Loreal voluminous and carbon black because i like my
10:05lashes black just like my heart but I couldn't resist i'm sorry i'm going to
10:11be bronzing my face and I'm using the morphe for brush to apply the jane
10:16bronzing powder and a shade inspire love this brush and love this bronzer these
10:20two together are amazing i think this bronzer is so great it's so blendable
10:25it's very light
10:26so I like that it's not orange and i like that i actually have to pack it on
10:29to get some color because you can sometimes go overboard bronzer right and
10:32you're like whoa
10:33why does it look like I have an orange blob on my face or it can look muddy but
10:36this one
10:37you really have to pack it on to get the shade to show up which I kind of
10:40appreciate because you won't go overboard to easily so it's going to
10:44blend that out all around the cheek area down on the job on the forehead the
10:47temples basically everywhere except the center of the face
10:50and i'm going to go in with my blush palette and this is by elf and this is
10:54in the shade dark they have a light one and a dark one
10:56and i'm using the doc one and i'm going to mix these two shades together one is
11:00like a raspberry any other one is a pink
11:02you can see how pigmented this is it is like it's pigmented and i'm using that
11:06exact same
11:07p for brush my morphe to blend this out and i'm really going to make sure i work
11:12at blending this out because it is really pigmented they aren't that crazy
11:15blendable but that's okay because they're so pigmented that my group worth
11:19it
11:20so now i'm going to make these to highlight shades in the Knicks highlight
11:23and contour palette and I'm using the morphe and 501 brush to apply this and
11:27look how pretty this highlight turned out
11:29it's so pretty I mean it's definitely white it's not like a champagne color or
11:34a gold color but i just think that it's such a beautiful highlight shade so i'm
11:38going to put a little bit out on my chin and a tiny bit of it on the side of my
11:40nose and really blend that out so we can get a nice glow going on because you
11:44know
11:45strobing is all the thing of this fall so I'm now going to line my lips using
11:49the revlon colorstay lip liner in the shade chocolate which this color does
11:53not like chocolate to me right like it looks like such a berry fault I'm shade
11:58it doesn't like chocolate but that's okay
11:59any lip liner will work i'm going to go with a super super dark lip but i just
12:03wanted to line my lips because this is going to kind of act as a base to keep
12:07the lipstick that we're going to put on next in place so it doesn't slide all
12:11over our face and now i'm going to go in with an oldie but a goodie and this is
12:14revlon black cherry any of my OG subscribers will remember this from like
12:18the first six months that i was on youtube so i thought we would bring it

1:39thanks for watching i love you and I'll see you soon
1:41I I wouldn't room Annie fashion if you don't like it
1:44please don't watch it I mean it's not exactly how he says it but you know I'm
1:48trying to be a lady here on my channel
1:50hm you know I am a quick disclaimer my spray tan is bad
1:55this is not cute on my wrist so throughout the video orange hands orange
1:59everything
1:59uh it's not good so I want to throw that out there yes I'm aware this rate as bad
2:04it's not a good situation
2:06all right let's do this thingy first things first I'm going to prime my eyes
2:10and I'm going to be using the Too Faced shadow insurance
2:12I typically use a concealer and then set it with powder for my eye primer which I
2:16actually do prefer but for some reason i was just i don't know i was in a mood
2:20and I was like you know what we're going to do this today so that's what I did
2:23now i'm going to be going in with the man emu a and makeup geek eyeshadow
2:26palette and I'm going to be grabbing beaches in cream right here top Center
2:31taking any fluffy brush that you love and you trust and you have a long-term
2:34committed relationship with going to go in and just blend that out all the way
2:38from the outer corner to the inner corner
2:40as you can see beaches and cream pretty much doesn't show up on me especially
2:42when I have a spray tan like I do right now I'm still gonna throw it in there
2:45just for good faith and it'll help blend out the next colors
2:48I'm going to be mixing sora and frappe and I'm going to do the exact same thing
2:52as i do with peaches and cream i'm going to take these two colors and i'm going
2:55to go from inner corner to outer corner all the way back and forth and
2:59windshield wiper motions
3:00I'm putting the heaviest of the pigment right there in the crease of my eye
3:03if you do not have a crease in your eye you can just create one just pick a
3:07place and go back and forth and windshield wiper motions and then
3:10whatever is left over on my brush
3:12I will just lightly kind of blend upward as you see me doing right now but I
3:15don't have barely any pigment on my brush at that point
3:18now i'm going to mix Mars and Aphrodite Mars is like a really intense kind of
3:23reddish raspberry and Aphrodite is a really kind of beautiful true deep dark
3:27brown
3:28I'm going to mix those two together to get almost like the color of like
3:31chocolate cherries i want to say I'm going to take again any fluffy brush
3:36that you love this is the more p.m. 4 3 3 i'm going to keep this a little bit
3:39lower than I did with the first shade since it is so dark and i'm really gonna
3:42go heavy in the crease itself as you can see I'm being very sloppy on the lid
3:46because i don't care how that looks
3:48I'm not gonna worry about blending that out because i'm going to cover that up
3:51with another shade in just a few moments I'm only going to worry about blending
3:54out the top area in the crease so i will go back with another fluffy brush which
3:59is a little bit more of either frappe or saw just any light brown you could grab
4:03beaches and cream and we're just going to go over that area nice and slow and
4:07very
4:08soft just to slightly blend out those edges without making them come too high
4:12or look too jagged
4:14now i'm going to pick up cosmopolitan which is a really beautiful kind of
4:17Rosie golden shade and grabbing a mac 242 brush I did wet my brush a little
4:22bit with fix plus i'm going to begin
4:25just to put this all over the entire lid and at first I was like do I only one
4:29purpose in the inner corner and kind of fade out I wasn't quite sure but then I
4:32ended up doing a really intense it almost creates like a an illusion of a
4:37cut crease because I want my brush and I made it so metallic i'm going to really
4:41use this brush to make it really intense so my lid color is just strictly
4:46cosmopolitan and then that darker chocolate cherry shade is just strictly
4:51in the crease so that's what i decided to do with that and then I packed on
4:54glitter later I just love the way it all came together
4:57I'm going and just making it a little bit darker in the crease area because I
5:01just thought that it is a little bit more extra what I had on cosmopolitan
5:04now for liner
5:06i am using the Maybelline gel liner I swear to god you guys like this is still
5:11my favorite gel liner is my favorite gel liner forever like nothing compares to
5:15it
5:15everything smudges nothing lasts nothing is as black as I wanted to be like this
5:19is the most bomb liner ever and it's from the drugstore you can get a
5:22walgreens CVS alta it's my favorite gel liner of all time so i am doing a wing
5:27but I'm going to keep it a little on the thin side this is at least 10 for me
5:30because i love a big huge intense
5:32whoa I like a big intense thick week but I'm going to keep this one small so I'm
5:37going to go in with a little bit of the two-faced glitter glue
5:40this is my absolute favorite way to apply glitter it's the best glitter glue
5:44out there
5:44it doesn't separate it doesn't like it really is super glue for glitter it
5:48keeps on your eyes it's not going to fall off throughout the night
5:51it really does stay in place it's a gorilla glue for your eyeshadow it's
5:55amazing so I will pack it on with a brush and I'll grab glitter and almost
5:59immediately pack the glitter on right over top of it you want to make sure you
6:01do it fairly quickly because once the glue dries it doesn't serve the same
6:05purpose you want that glue to still be tacky on the lid when you're packing on
6:08the glitter and since I am packing on so much glitter
6:11by the way i'm using eye candy glitter in the shade taffie such a gorgeous
6:15color
6:16it's like a rose gold kind of coppery pink it went perfect with this
6:19I look
6:20this is the same girl I was also wearing in my last video because a lot of you
6:23guys were asking so i will find it link it down below for you
6:26I'm just covering up my eyeliner again so i don't have a glitter all over my
6:29liner because that is definitely a pet peeve of mine is when you have glitter
6:32all over the liner so I always make sure to cover that up on myself and then i'm
6:35going to pop on some lashes and i'm using flutter lashes and the style
6:39Ashley these are such a cool ash they're like very wispy very long but yet
6:45they're not super duper thick so you can still see through them and see the
6:49eyeshadow look if you know what I'm saying
6:50now i'm going to prime my skin and i'm using this ridiculously bougie YSL
6:55primer
6:56um I don't know the exact name of it but again i find it below I'll find it all
6:59this if you guys down below but it's a blurring primer it's my second time
7:02using it and i really like it
7:03we're gonna kick it old school with the giorgio armani a luminous silk
7:06foundation
7:08i am using the morphe and 439 foundation brush to apply this I swear this
7:14foundation is just so good like if you've been around my channel for a
7:17while you know this was pretty much a foundation I use for a solid eight
7:20months and I haven't used it in a long time have been trying to foundations
7:24I went back to this one and I'm just like oh I missed you so much it's just
7:28such a good foundation i forgot how much I loved it
7:31so then for concealer i'm going to you know just past the entire bottle on my
7:35face no big deal
7:36i'm going to be using the Urban Decay a weightless naked concealer this like i
7:40said before my favorite concealer of all time I have gone everyone addicted to it
7:44i've got my mom addicted I've got my sister I've got my friends I've got my
7:47cousins
7:48I've got everybody to do this concealer I swear works for everyone i know it's
7:52so beautiful it is so weightless
7:54it doesn't get a crazy mess it's not too oily it's not too creamy it's it's it's
7:59the most beautiful concealer ever I swear like urban decay has like some
8:02voodoo going on in their lives because they created the most incredible
8:05concealer of all time so i am putting that under my eyes forehead nose and a
8:09little on the chin and I'm going to grab the anastacio banana powder and I'm
8:13going to pack that wherever I put the concealer so i use a pretty light amount
8:17and I am blending out with a really really fluffy brush
8:20this is the e3 it's part of the more feet Elite Collection and as you can see
8:23it is really yellow and the reason i like that is because it's going to help
8:26- really bright in
8:27my face and especially once i put on bronzer it'll just kind of pull the
8:31whole look together everything will look nice and light and fresh
8:35now we're going to go in and contour using my favorite contour powder and my
8:38favorite contour brush this is my favorite way of contouring as far as the
8:43brush goes this is the m5 23 brush my morphe i am obsessed i think it's the
8:48most amazing contour brush I used to love the NARS e21 and now this has taken
8:52over my holy grail because it just makes it softer and more blendable and easy to
8:56apply it's just it's beautiful
8:57and then for the actual powder i'm using Mac shade stir you can find on mac
9:01cosmetics calm and I realized the center of my forehead was looking dingy and
9:05dirty so I grabbed a little bit of that Anastasio banana powder and i lightened
9:09it up
9:09my face looks really like because i was so dark like darkly spray-tanned but
9:13once everything oxidizes in like 30 minutes I will get a little bit darker
9:17my face will match my body a little bit more
9:20I'm going to grab the rcn day and no color powder and i'm going to just put
9:24this right there going from the corner of my lip to the corner of the top of my
9:28ear not quarters right corner of my lip to the top of my tea i'm going to make a
9:31line going to let that sit while I finish my makeup and then it will just
9:34sharpen my contour got it from the brows what you gotta do when you see that
9:39extra hair grow and just get rid of it
9:41I do not suggest is going in with scissors to your browse by the way if
9:44you haven't done it before like first go to a professional don't chop off your
9:47browser ladies my best friend literally took scissors to her eyebrows when she
9:51was 12 years old it was the saddest thing ever
9:53oh my god girl i still feel for you i'm filling in my brows using the Anasazi a
9:58brow definer i feel this is the only black pencil never going to use for the
10:01rest of my life I'm so obsessed that makes it so quick and easy and then i'm
10:05going to go in and grab the highlighting shade from the man emu a pallet and this
10:09is the color artemis on the kind of its kinda reminds me of mac nylon in a sense
10:13it's a really beautiful highlight and it's got a little bit like a yellow
10:16sheet and it's gorgeous so I'm going to pack a little bit of that only the high
10:19point of the brow and then a teeny tiny bit on the very inner corner of the eye
10:23just to keep things kind of nice and bright and I'm going to grab a frappe
10:27and then
10:28and just any pencil brush and I'm going to just run this over the lower lash
10:31line
10:31I want this to be darkest and most intense on the very outer corner
10:35that's just a personal preference for me though that has nothing to do with the
10:38look
10:38that's just the way I like it on my eye shape is i like it to be the darkest and
10:42I get to come down the lowest on the outer corner of the eye that I'm
10:46grabbing a little bit of Aphrodite I didn't show a shot of it but that's what
10:49i'm doing right now is that super dark brown and then pack that on super super
10:53tight to my lashline like literally in my lashes on my lash line as close as
10:58possible and then i will blend it back out with more frappe
11:02you can grab some Mars and go in and blend that out if you want to make it a
11:04little more rise Barry under there that's totally up to you and then I'm
11:08going to grab mac cosmetics fascinating i call this is like stark white like is
11:13white as paper it's not creamy it's not a nude it is white but i wanted to use
11:17it today to really make the colors pop and also make my eyes stand out as well
11:21then i'm going to go in with a blush and i'm using the sephora brand blush in the
11:25shade
11:25tangerine tease I was online shopping a couple weeks ago on sephora.com and I
11:30just tried a couple of these i bought some of them because I've never tried
11:33before brand blush and some of them i don't really love but this one I think
11:36is really really beautiful it's got some nice shimmer and it's a beautiful coral
11:40i'm going to go ahead and just erase that bacon if you will to reveal a nice
11:44shot contour if this is too sharp for you totally understandable go back with
11:49your contour brush ever so lightly and just lightly go over it and it will make
11:53it a little bit more buff out but I'm going to keep it nice and sharp girl i'm
11:57going to go in with this malli face and cheek palette i discovered this because
12:00of kathleenlights and I'm not gonna lie i ordered on amazon for like two times
12:04the price because I'm just that kind of girl when someone's reading about
12:07something I'm like oh I have to have it i'll do i need to do to get my hands on
12:11this bad boy but can we talk about this highlight no let's just take a moment of
12:15silence for the highlight
12:16oh my god I can't breathe okay i'm gonna take that same highlight i'm going to
12:20put on the Cupid's bow
12:22this is just a little trick to make the mouth look a little bit powdery ER and
12:26i'm going to take a latte and I'm going I'm sorry
12:28frappe and i'm going to just coat that all over the bottom lip again you will
12:32see it's going to give it more of a shadow to make it look like it is fuller
12:36now i'm going to go in with mac cosmetics subculture lip pencil
12:40i just purchased this last week because this used to be my favorite lip pencil
12:43ever when i worked at mac i wore every day with every shade of knew that you
12:47can think of it was my go-to color and I just remember like why don't you use
12:51that color anymore so I jumped online and i bought it and I'm in love with it
12:54all over again
12:55it's such a good everyday lip liner like it's just the perfect color for
12:59day-to-day lips at least for me it is a great neutral and i'm going to go in
13:03with the Ariana Grande and mac cosmetics
13:05Viva Glam gloss if you guys don't know about the mac viva glam program it's
13:09amazing
13:10one hundred percent of the proceeds go to men women and children living with
13:13and affected by HIV and AIDS so it's always nice to know that your money is
13:16going to a great organization whenever you buy a Viva Glam gloss or lip sticks
13:21so last but not least I'm going to just cut my lower lashes with some mascara
13:24because i forgot to do this and I looked at myself in all right way
13:27something missing so i'm using the mac extended play mascara which is my
13:31favorite for lower lash and then this look is complete
13:34I hope you guys enjoy the video thanks so much for watching i love you and i'll
13:37see you in my next video bye guys
0:18hey guys today's video I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look
0:23that you see right here i need to come up with a different row my goodness
0:27gracious
0:28every single he got me like it's been like almost four years i think i'm still
0:33doing the same intro really rockin
0:35I am ridiculously obsessed with this makeup look I'm trying so hard not to
0:39stare at myself in the viewfinder and seem like a total narcissist because
0:41every two seconds I want to be like hmm i don't remember the last time I loved
0:45my makeup look as much as I love this one like this like filled up my cup if
0:50you know what I mean like I just feel like alive with this makeup look on
0:53and the reason I'm putting this tutorial for you guys is because i was wearing
0:56the same look a couple days ago and i was on snapchat that day and I went over
1:00to Twitter and I could not believe how many requests there were from you guys
1:04treating me to film this makeup for you guys
1:06so that is exactly what I did you know how it works so wish is my command
1:09that's how we do it around here but i did just kind of spice it up a little
1:14bit i added lashes that are a little bit more dramatic and I made my lower
1:17lashline pop just a little bit more
1:19I just feel like every time I do the same look like a second time it gets
1:23better like the first time I like it but the second time I usually love it and
1:26keep that in mind because if you try to look one time and you're not like crazy
1:30in love
1:30give it a second shot I feel like the more you do something more you can
1:33perfect it like practice makes perfect and i'm saying so
1:36yes I am so in love with this colorful liner trend I know colorful liners are
1:39really in every single spring and summer but this year it's everywhere and brands
1:44have been coming out with more colorful liners which I just love so much
1:48I've seen so many gorgeous looks with colorful liners on Instagram there was
1:51this one girl that you like a smoky black eye with a white liner is so
1:54gorgeous i saw in the popular page on Manny he recently did a makeup look
1:59using the same exact liner i think i think it was the same exact liner a
2:04couple weeks ago his look was much more subtle than this so if you want to check
2:07that out
2:08totally beautiful but yeah i'm just i'm in love with this i really wanted to a
2:12yellow liner like a yellow line would be really fun and different but i'm trying
2:16to think of how it would work i think like a turquoise like almost like sea
2:20foam
2:21we have a gorgeous like a yellow liner and
2:23I'm dying and rambling i love this look and I hope that you guys maybe get some
2:28inspiration to jump outside of your comfort zone and try something different
2:31like a weed colorful either because it's just so much fun not to mention it's
2:34like fun for everybody around you every single time you blink it's like but a
2:38nice surprise for all of your friends and family so I hope that you guys enjoy
2:41this video thanks for watching i love you and I'll see you guys soon
2:44no right please God no I don't want to get glam I want to go back to bed
2:49I'm just kidding okay i want to start by priming my eyes I'm using any concealer
2:55that's just the way i prime it
2:57i'm using a dry Beauty Blender just to blend that out you can use your finger a
3:00damp Beauty Blender a brush
3:02it doesn't matter this is just the way i prime my eyes it's what works for me
3:05after I had my entire eyelid covered with a thin amount of concealer i will
3:09just a little bit of powder over a translucent powder
3:12it can be like a setting powder it doesn't matter just anything to make it
3:15Matt and first and foremost i'm going to be going in with makeup geek
3:19chickity since we're going to be going in with reds and corals and kind of
3:22picky shades today i wanted to go in with chickadee
3:24first it is one of my favorite all-time colors for the crease when i'm doing a
3:28warm smoky eye and i am using a sigma e40 which is one of my oldies but
3:32goodies it's a great blending brush and as you can see i'm bringing it all the
3:36way to the inner corner to the outer corner and I'm keeping it very low on
3:39the entire crease area and then once i have basically no product left as you
3:43see I bring it up basically all the way towards my brow and that's how we get
3:46that really seamless blending perfection look that we want on the ice
3:50now i'm going to go in with more fiesta this is a single eyeshadow by morphy
3:54recently I'm package like every single morphy eyeshadow like a couple weeks ago
3:58and put them in pallets and so I've been kind of dabbling around them more and
4:02more and so I'm going to do the exact same thing with this that I do a
4:04chickadee and put it just directly over the first color right there in my crease
4:08then i'm going to reach for makeup geek
4:10morocco I don't know why I just discovered this eyeshadow like why have
4:14I not been using this every day of my life
4:16welcome home mama you are now a part of the family how long with this eyeshadow
4:20is so gorgeous as you can see me doing the exact same thing and bring this one
4:24down on my lid a little bit more than the rest
4:26just because i felt like it there wasn't really no rhyme or reason I was just
4:29having fun and I'm going to grab Mac red brick going to be honest you guys it is
4:34not necessary to put on four different shades of corals and oranges
4:37it is so totally not but just because this is one of my favorite colors to
4:41work with I wanted to utilize as many of my shadows as possible but honestly can
4:45do this with two or three of the shadows you do not need all of them
4:48I'm grabbing anastacio burnt orange which is such a beautiful kind of
4:52caramel camel shade if you're like a doctor all complexions would be such a
4:57beautiful shade for your transition right there in your crease for an
5:00everyday color it's so gorgeous
5:02picking up another blending brushes the morphe and 4 3 3 i'm going to do is just
5:06grab a little bit more of that makeup geek morocco and Anasazi burnt orange
5:09and just put a little bit more intense and make it a little bit deeper in my
5:12crease because i want to just a little bit more like pronunciation in the
5:16crease area
5:17so then I'm going to pick up the new tart clay pot waterproof liner and this
5:22is in the shade
5:23mint and I'm going to be applying this the exact same way that I would apply
5:27any regular basic black liner except honey today we in basic
5:32I want to make this pretty thick honestly I felt like when I was done
5:35with the entire locals like I could have made this wing even thicker you can
5:38honestly go as thick and dramatic as you want with this wing because it's already
5:42such a fun bold look it will just add to it and grow up you're gonna do it do the
5:45damn thing right
5:46i have to of course obsessed over my wings to make sure they're even because
5:50I'm not being funny you guys it's not normal I'm such a perfectionist with my
5:54makeup if my wings aren't even I will literally wipe off my makeup and just
5:56leave the house with no makeup I rather have no makeup and uneven liner because
6:00i am that I'm a psychopath ok moving on
6:03I'm cutting my lashes with mascara to make sure that I don't have any of that
6:06eyeliner like stuck on it so that my natural lashes blow up my fake lashes
6:10really nicely and i'm going to be using the lower lashes and fluff and wispy
6:15these are probably the number one or two favorite dramatic lashes I think they're
6:20so gorgeous and now i'm going to move on to the face and I'm going to be priming
6:24it using my favorite primer right now which is the backlight priming filter it
6:29just gives such a gorgeous radiance to the skin
6:31if you're dry and you want radiance girl this primer is bomb and I'm going to
6:35grab my L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion foundation and i'm going to take my
6:40foundation brush like I just take it and directly put it into the center of that
6:43cushion
6:44I don't press really hard because it can get full coverage really quickly
6:47i press like halfway down and i am using the morphe and 439 brush to blend this
6:51out
6:52this is my all-time favorite foundation brush a bar ever ever I've gone through
6:57a lot of obsession with a lot of foundation brushes and this is my
7:00absolute number one I feel like no matter what i try i always go back to
7:02this guy right here and then I'm going to pick up my favorite concealer ever
7:06and this is the Urban Decay Naked weightless concealer we put this on the
7:09entire under eye area and I know it looks like it's a lot but that's because
7:12it is i'm going to use a damp Beauty Blender though and using the damp Beauty
7:17Blender makes it so that even if you apply too much concealer it will pick up
7:21the excess and just make the under eyes look so natural which is why i have been
7:25die hard for a Beauty Blender for like the past two years now I'm going to grab
7:28the Anasazi a banana powder
7:31i'm going to set my under eye area i'm only using the banana powder today and
7:34I'm not mixing with anything else because i didn't want the under eye to
7:37be to highlighted I didn't want to be too shiny or to radiate I just wanted it
7:40to look really nice and soft with the rest of the skin and now using a fluffy
7:44brush I'm going to just apply a shear amount of powder no additional coverage
7:47just wanting to kind of slightly modify myself so I'm not super duper do we eat
7:51and then i'm going to go in with ardency Inn liner in the shade
7:55lilac oh these liners are my number one favorite liners in the game
8:00they're so creamy they stay so long my inner line and it kind of frustrating me
8:04because you can't really see the color popping on camera button person this
8:07color was gorgeous and I'm going to grab Mac deep damson this is a matte kind of
8:12wine
8:13purple shade and i'm going to take a definer brush any definer brush anything
8:17small precise will do we take it all the way from my lower lashes
8:21we're like my mint green liner ends i'm going to bring it into the inner corner
8:24and i'm going to stop it where my lashes stop growing if that makes sense and i'm
8:28going to pick up another morphy single eyeshadow this is in the shade magical
8:32magenta and i'm going to overlay it right on top of deep damn sinks I just
8:36felt like it was looking just a little too basic and typical under there and I
8:40wanted to really brighten it up and make it a little bit more fun because if
8:43we're gonna do it we're going to do it right like I want this look to stand out
8:46and be really colorful and different
8:48I'm going to pick up just a little bit more of that make a geek morocco and use
8:50it to blend out that lower lash line
8:52this will also help tie the entire look together to bring some of that warm
8:56orange on the lower lash as well now i'm going to go in with mac nylon my
9:00favorite brow highlight in our corner highlight of all time
9:05this has been a ride or die product of mine legit since what 2,000 oh my god
9:092005 it's been a while
9:11I'm going to fill in my brows using the anastacio brow definer today is full of
9:16my favorites guys I just cause my favorite favorite product video because
9:19this is my favorite brow product ever like I don't think you understand
9:24everybody in my life has this definer now because I'm like wait a second
9:28you're still using the Browse i'll come on girl what are you living in a lot
9:31like this is the most amazing brow pencil of all time there's nothing like
9:36it i'm just ridiculously dedicated so let's just move past that we are going
9:40to be doing a little contouring and i'm going to be using a benefit hoola
9:43bronzer an oldie but a goodie
9:45I want to do an update a contour video soon because I just been using so many
9:48different brushes recently and we have been doing it I've been making it much
9:52more of an intense angle as far as from the top of the ear to the corner of the
9:56lips and then as always I am blending out the forehead area just around the
10:01hairline and making sure I don't get any product in the center of the forehead or
10:04center of the face because it will defeat the contouring purpose
10:07all right now mom's gonna bake do you see how much power I'm you think it
10:11looks like it's snowing in here do you see hope
10:14i'm using the RCM a no color powder to do a little bit of baking while i apply
10:19my blush and i'm using one of the new Becca
10:22blushes in the shade Tiger Lily they are very high pigmented they are very
10:26shimmery very frosty they're like similar to their highlight formula but
10:30for a blush so i use this coral shade to kind of tie the eyes and the cheeks
10:34together and then on top of it
10:36not necessary but I just felt like a little bit of pink - I picked up a
10:39little bit of mac kini pedal and i'm going to just put a little bit of that
10:43right over top so I feel like it was a little to call on my cheeks and I was
10:46like
10:47again not necessary I'm just extra and when you have a big makeup collection
10:52you want to use a lot you know what I'm saying so you can totally Capac blushes
10:55on do more than one but it is not necessary to all you guys going to go
10:59ahead and wipe away all that power that I put down there but then I was like
11:02wait a second
11:03I like the way this area looks i'm going to put just a little bit more and I'll
11:06dust it off in like a minute
11:07I'm going to grab some of the becca shimmering skin Perfector in the shade
11:11opal on a more feet 501 brush and I'm going to just highlight the tops of my
11:15cheekbones i still love opal so much it's like a cool tone highlight having a
11:19little bit of gray in it but it's just so beautiful it really stands out in a
11:23crowd
11:24I just love like the silver tones and I think it's really pretty I'm going to
11:28coat my lower lashes with some mascara I'm using the cabinet qua mascara i love
11:32this one it's my mom's favorite mascara and i've been using it a lot recently
11:35again and I i forgot how much i love it as well
11:38for lips i'm going to use color pop BFF lippie Stix it's like a really pretty
11:43orgy coralie kind of pale terracotta has a longer description of my life and then
11:49for gloss i'm going to go on with the Kylie cosmetics lip gloss in the shade
11:53so cute
11:54which is the Palace of all her shades I personally and not the biggest fan of
11:58these glasses I don't hate them but I'm not crazy about them you know
12:01you know I'm saying ok now i'm saying but I really like this with combination
12:04i think it looks super super pretty you know me I love a good nude and then just
12:08because I want to do a little something extra
12:10I'm going to take a little bit of brown shadow and just put it on my lower lip
12:13area just to give a natural contour to make my lips look a little bit fuller
12:17and powder and then use a little bit of clear brow gel so that these babies stay
12:21in place and that completes the look
12:23I hope you guys enjoyed thanks for watching love you see you soon
0:16hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial for you

0:24getting ready and I have to leave my house right now like I finished right on
0:28time so yeah I am sick i woke up this morning with eight terrible sore throat
0:34hurts so bad and probably go to the doctor because it's just not going i'm
0:37starting to think i'm getting a fever 2 which is just beyond typical because i
0:41am flying this week on
0:43i am going to New York City for a half business half vacation
0:47I will be there for four days i'm leaving on thursday return on monday so
0:49it's like of course I'm getting sick right now right

0:55I'm leaving my house soon as i'm done with this to go spend the afternoon with
0:59my family for easter so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this makeup tutorial it's
1:03very spring appropriate very fresh
1:06I absolutely love this look I'm wearing it constantly constantly recently
1:09this is the same look that was wearing in my favorites video that i just did
1:12and so many of you were asking what I was wearing if I could do a tutorial so
1:16here it is
1:17I hope that you guys enjoy thanks so much for watching i love you guys and
1:19I'll see you soon bye
1:21hello my loves the first thing we're going to do today is prime our face
1:24i am using the Makeup Forever radiant primer I'm going to massage this on my
1:28face with clean hands you know the drill you know how to prime your skin moving
1:31on
1:31i'm going to use the smashbox primer water only because i was so dry from
1:35being sick but two primers not necessary let's get real
1:38I'm going to also go in with the cabin a quan liquid highlighter I talked about
1:41this in my most recent favorites video this highlighter is my favorite going to
1:45massage that all over my bare skin
1:47just to give a really beautiful radiant glow as the base then i'm going to go in
1:51with your new dare foundation and I'm going to be applying that with what do
1:54you know the Sigma f80 kabuki brush as always i'm currently using the shade 030
1:59in this foundation and actually is a pinch too light for me but that's okay
2:03i'm going to go with bronzer and i'm going to warm up the skin and add some
2:06color
2:06I would prefer my foundation to be a little bit too light over too dark
2:10any day of the week now I'm going to be applying my under eye concealer and i'm
2:14using the Urban Decay Naked weightless full-coverage concealer
2:18I think I just nailed it i'm going to apply a little bit of on the under eye
2:21area and then also on the lid as well and I'm going to blend all that out with
2:24a damp Beauty Blender a tiny bit of this product goes a very
2:28long way so as you see i do not have to over use it and this is my favorite way
2:32to prime my eyes is to just use concealer and then go over top of it
2:36with a powder so i am using the anastacio banana powder to set this
2:40entire area that's my favorite way to Prime and i am using the morphe m510
2:45brush for this i really like it because it's kind of tapered and precise and i
2:48really like it for that area
2:50now i'm going to go in with the Chanel cream bronzer I should have done this
2:53before i set my under eye area i never recommend using any creams after powders
2:58but I wasn't feeling well so I wasn't really with it that day so I forgot
3:02but if you're doing this on your own do the cream first and then set the under
3:05eye area so i am using the Sigma f80 to which is an angled kabuki brush to apply
3:10this all over the cheekbones the forehead the temples the chin I'm just
3:14kind of bronzing not contouring
3:16now i'm going in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow and i'm using a sigma
3:21e40 brush to blend this back and forth and windshield wiper motions in my
3:24crease like i said before peach smoothie is my absolute favorite number one eye
3:27shadow of all time I basically can't do any makeup look without it it's just
3:31perfect for a nice transition shade
3:34now i'm grabbing makeup geek cupcake on that exact same brush I'm going to dust
3:38this right i mean that color back and forth and windshield wiper motions from
3:41inner corner to outer corner and then i will blend it upward as that product
3:46kind of disappears from my brush
3:47i will start going up like you see right now just to make sure that everything is
3:50blended together and we have no harsh lines
3:52now i'm going to go in with makeup geek latte this is kind of a reddish medium
3:57brown color and using a more precise brush this is the e25 from sigma i'm
4:01going to put that lower in my crease area so as you can see i am no longer
4:04kind of blending upward like I do with the other colors
4:07I'm kind of blending onward onto the eyelid if that makes sense as you can
4:11see right here
4:12then I'll go back with the sigma e40 and blend everything out once again with
4:15absolutely no additional product on that brush
4:18now i'm taking make a get chickity this is an oldie but a goodie has been one of
4:21my favorites forever
4:22it was just a touch of that i'm going to put it in that upper crease as well a
4:26lot of people are fearful of this color because it's orange and it can look
4:28crazy but if you use just a touch of it adds such a beautiful glow
4:32now i'm going in with makeup geek foiled eyeshadow and this is in the spotlight
4:36this is one of my absolute favorite shadows ever it is so beautiful it is
4:40such a gorge
4:41is beaming highlight shade for the lid i am using a mac 242 brush which is just a
4:46flat shader brush to apply that all over the lid
4:48you can use your finger for this product that works really well what's great
4:51about these is you get no fallout which is like my favorite part
4:55so once i put that generously all over the lid i will go back with the Sigma
4:58e25 and just kind of go over the edges that way there's not a distinct harsh
5:02line to where the shadow starts then i'm going to fill in my eyebrows i'm using
5:06anastacio browse in the shade
5:07nope i'm going to skip through this really quickly though because it's not
5:10so fun to watch
5:11in my opinion now i'm going in with mac and bark I love embark this is one of my
5:15colors that I just have to have from Mac it is a go-to color for me it's a super
5:20dark rich kind of purply brown and using an e 15 from sigma i'm going to just
5:25press that really tightly on my lower lashline not too generously because i
5:29don't want to be too dark and smoky then taking any pencil brush and a little bit
5:33of that same latte color that I used on my upper lid
5:36i'm going to just blend that out making the goofiest face of all time
5:39I'm going to go in with mango tango this is another shade from makeup geek
5:44such a pretty kind of orangie pink I love this color and I'm just gonna put a
5:48little dab of it on that lower lash line as well just to give some more dimension
5:52now i'm going in with a creamy ivory eyeliner and I'm going to line my
5:56waterline to really open up my eyes and make them look very fresh and springy i
6:00will list the one that I use in the description bar down below
6:03now i'm applying mascara so I am prepping my eyes for lashes
6:08we're going to be going on with my absolute favorite which are whisper
6:11sweet nothings by the lore lashes I love these because they look beautiful with
6:14or without eyeliner
6:16they're not too over the top of my face into dramatic but yet they're still
6:19super girly and they make a statement
6:21now i'm going to go in with makeup geek blush man it's a makeup geek day I'm
6:25going to be mixing a rendezvous and spellbound to make a really kind of
6:29purply pastel pinky cheek i have been loving loving this color of cheek
6:33recently for spring it's just so girly and dainty and super feminine
6:37now i'm going to be doing something that is so unnecessary and i'm going to be
6:41using it to separate highlighters these are both by becca and we are going in
6:44with opal and moonstone and i'm mixing those together just because i own them
6:48both and they are absolutely gorgeous when combined so i am using
6:51PM 501 brush to place this all over the tops of my cheekbones
6:55I keep the bow a dot on my chin and i'm also going to use the shades to
6:59highlight the brow bone as well i am again using the mac 242 brush to
7:03highlight the brow
7:04now i'm going to go and of course with mascara this is Mack nigga blacklash
7:08this is my favorite lower lash mascara I know it seems high maintenance to have a
7:11favorite lower lash mascara but I do
7:13now i'm going to go in with colour-pop lippie sick in the shade a westie a
7:17beautiful baby pink
7:18I'm going to top that off with a nars gloss in the shade glow pink which is

1:28enjoy this spring a huge trend is copper eyes oranges yellows coppers warm ground
1:35which I love because you usually think of autumn and fall for that type of
1:39trying but this year's spring you guys know
1:41that is like literally right up my alley I am so super excited so I thought I'll
1:46go ahead and shows with you it's a very fresh based super easy not even wearing
1:50eyeliner today which is crazy for me right so i hope you guys enjoyed this
1:53video i hope that you do it yourself a call if you do don't forget to tag me in
1:57any pictures and as always all the information every single detail every
2:01single question everything product that he mentioned in this video is going to
2:04be in the description bar below so many guys so much else sees it but we are
2:10going to start off today with the skin so first I'm going to do is primarily
2:13using do our globe maximizer like boosting primer and we are going to
2:17press this into the skin it will make such a difference if you press your
2:20primer into your skin as opposed to just rubbing it across your pores
2:24then we are going to go in with NARS sheer glow foundation and marc jacobs
2:28mixing these two together just gives me a really nice natural luminous finish
2:33I just that's just me I like mixing my foundations and i am using a sigma a
2:39brush to apply the foundation as always
2:42and then I'm going to go in with tarte amazonian clay concealer which I don't
2:46think I've ever even use on camera before but I actually would like to
2:48finish of this and i'm using it just too lightly highlight some areas of my
2:52phases where needed so around the lips
2:55Cupid's bow chin nostrils where you just get more morally red and as you can see
3:00this is not a very intense highlight it's nice and mild which I really like
3:04for a look like this since we really do want the skin to look nice and fresh and
3:08youthful but we don't want it to be like BAM highlighter or BAM contour your face
3:12so a little trick is just using your concealer for the face and I do prefer
3:16this concealer on the face as opposed to under the eyes
3:19I find that increases a little bit so under the eye i am going to use mac pro
3:23longwear concealer
3:25this one isn't she NW 20 which is a pinky beige undertone and as you can see
3:29it looks like i'm putting a lot on but i am actually blending it out and my
3:34finger will pick up a lot of the excess and then this is the f-86 brush by Sigma
3:39and the reason i love this brush so much is because it picks up so much excess
3:43concealer
3:43so you really don't get that buildup of chunky concealer that crease is
3:47underneath your eye i just love this brush because of that
3:50i'm also sweeping across my eyelid to prime for my eye shadow
3:54then I'm going to go in with my Bobby Brown Foundation stick to contour i will
3:58put my contouring video down below that's all about cream highlighter so
4:02you can see exactly what i'm doing and how I'm doing it but I am just using an
4:07angled brush again by Sigma absolutely love this brush for contouring as you
4:11can see it just blends out
4:13so naturally so beautifully I do pick up the product on the brush first as
4:18opposed to drawing on my face
4:20where the contour can be a little too strong and intense
4:24this will make it look much more buff out and natural just like you've been
4:27kissed by the Sun then i'm going to go in with Smashbox suntan matte bronzer
4:32with the NARS eat a brush and just hit that on that high point of my cheekbone
4:37and just dust it out I'm not going to really take this or drag all around the
4:41face just to bring more depth to certain areas and then using a Marc Jacobs
4:47foundation brush don't ask i'm obsessed with it i don't know why i bought it and
4:50now i'm just i'm in love this brush for buffing up my bronzer
4:53then i am using the brow bar to go this is by lightning lightning
4:57I have fallen in love with this product recently so i'm just going to use the
5:01lighter shade to fill in the inner part of my brow and the darker brown to fill
5:05in the outer part i am using anastacio brush
5:08I'm not sure which one it is but i will list it down below and then using the
5:12anastacio contour kit i am going to go in with this banana color right there in
5:17the center and mix it with mac emphasized as always
5:22and then just lightly dust that around the eye area
5:25i am using a sigma tapered highlighting brush to do so and as you can see i am
5:29just padding padding padding
5:31you don't want to go too generous with this highlight because again you don't
5:34want the skin to be really intense today you want to keep it nice not natural not
5:40au is not the word because this definitely isn't natural
5:43but you understand we don't want anything to be too intense and in your
5:46face so make sure using a light hand with all the products that you are
5:49applying so just using these highlighting powders just
5:52set everything that I've done then i'm going to go in with amber lights and
5:56copper ring both by math cosmetics
5:59these are the two shadows that i have been wearing for nine years of my life
6:02mixing them together is just absolutely beautiful
6:06so I am using a sigma e25 brush just about this all over my lid which is just
6:10a white goat hair blending black brush and this is the only brush that you will
6:14need for this look on the top of the eyelid and because these shadows are so
6:19creamy and smooth you don't even need another brush or another color to buff
6:24it out where typically in your transition shade and this look this is
6:28all you need
6:29with putting no additional products on that brush just buff upward and it will
6:33just naturally blend itself out just make sure you continuously go and
6:37windshield wiper motions
6:39then with any pencil brush this is an old-school pencil brush i just use it
6:42all the time is like my tried-and-true die don't even remember what brand is
6:45from it might be sedona lace just put that on earth your eyes from inner to
6:50outer corner buffing it back and forth again make sure you get even amount of
6:54product of the gold and the copper if anything like to pick up a little bit
6:58additional gold then with no additional products and a blending brush
7:02I just go back and forth just to buff that out even more and give a really
7:06blown out feel then i'm using Giorgio Armani is to kill mascara which oh my
7:11gosh I'm falling in love with this is a sample size and I do not want to spend
7:15that kind of money on mascara i'm pretty sure i'm going to have to then i'm using
7:18Mac spring machine
7:20blush which is absolutely gorgeous it's the perfect peach with a little bit of
7:25pink and i'm going to dust that on the apples of my cheeks working backward
7:29blending it into that bronzer toward the temple area making big buffing circular
7:34motions to again adds that sunkissed glow look
7:38then I go in with the same brush that I used to highlight and I just kind of go
7:41over that blush area and that's what gives you the really blown out airbrush
7:45look on the cheeks then i'm using the Bekaa highlighter in the shade opal
7:49which I am falling in love with this is such a great dupe for mac whisper of
7:54guilt which is only comes out like once a year in a collection and everybody
7:58loves it and it's such a beautiful highlighter but this one is so close
8:02in comparison I absolutely love it so using a sigma taper how to brush again
8:06I'm going to touch on the high points of my base
8:08moving on and I'm just going to cut my bottom lashes and any mascara you want
8:13just to finish off that I look now it is totally optional but i'm just going to
8:17pop on a pair of false lashes with look like this false lashes can be really
8:21really pretty and you don't need any eyeliner as long as you get close enough
8:24to your lash line
8:26these are escudo lashes I'm not sure which style i will list that in the
8:29description bar with a link to it and then using the Maybelline gel liner this
8:33is totally optional i just wanted to show you an easy tip just to push it up
8:37on that top waterline
8:39this will make your lashes look thicker fuller and blend your natural ones with
8:43your fake ones it's also a great tip just to make your lashes look fuller you
8:46know if you're not wearing falsies then using the Tarte Amazonian butter
8:50lipstick and golden pink
8:52I'm going to also mix that with the YSL rouge alup number 15
8:56using patting motions to get my favorite lip color for spring
9:00absolutely love then setting everything with Urban Decay eyeshadow makeup
9:04setting spray i'm going to take a shower in it just as everything is set and then
9:08you're all done so i hope you enjoy this fresh-faced spring tutorial and love you
9:13guys and I'll see you soon
0:00hey guys so today I'm going to be doing it really easy everyday fresh face
0:05makeup look
0:06this is truly an everyday makeup look this is as little as it gets for me if I
0:10am NOT doing this and I'm not doing anything
0:13i typically only wear make up about three or four days a week me sometimes
0:18like one or two days a week but three to four days a week and this is a look
0:21I wear one like I have to get up early and i'm going to be running errands all
0:24day long
0:24I don't want to be looking like a caveman but at the same time I want to
0:27give a little something
0:29so this is like my happy medium where I'm not all dolled up and glamorous
0:32oh yeah i'm not looking like I dead so this is super easy
0:37basic gonna work for everybody of course i have a couple versions of like my
0:41everyday makeup look
0:43this is the most easy basic shortest one that I have you have an upgraded version
0:47of this that's a few more additional products a little bit more glamorous
0:51I of course will be happy to do that for you if you want to see that look as well
0:54but I thought we would start with the basics so i hope you enjoyed this makeup
0:58tutorial and i will see you guys soon
1:04good morning everybody
1:07well hello honey boo go nice to see you shirtless
1:10ok moving on the first thing we're going to do is put on our foundation I'm using
1:14bucks and show some skin weightless foundation
1:16i'm going to be using my very own brush line today making your tips I'm going to
1:22just warm this up and emulsified on the tips of my fingers
1:24make sure your hands are freshly clean and then i'm going to just rub this on
1:28my face I know you're probably thinking oh what the hell just froze over where
1:32is your Sigma f80 but when you're in a rush and if your brushes are dirty
1:36mhm my situation sometimes you just gotta use your fingertips God made him
1:41for a reason
1:42so make sure you Bluff in the foundation it's not gonna look as pretty as a brush
1:45but hey we can manage that i'm using maybelline fit me concealer
1:49this is a drugstore concealer obviously since its by Maybelline
1:52it is a nice sheer concealer but you can get a medium coverage out of it because
1:56it is buildable using my middle finger i'm going to just blend this in and then
2:01i'm also going to make sure that I get it on my eyelid I always always do this
2:04because you have a lot of veins in your eyelid and if you're tired you're
2:07definitely get redness there and it's gonna show all your dirty secrets so
2:11cover up your eyelid area it will smooth everything out make you look a lot more
2:15fresh I tap this nav
2:17as always I take it back towards my temple make sure when you're finishing
2:21off you go in an inward motion from outer corner in your corner
2:24it will help prevent creasing then using bare minerals
2:27well rested powder this powder is formulated to make you look well-rested
2:31has a brightening effect in it but it is not a highlighter so don't get it
2:35confused this is just going to set your concealer and give a nice well rested
2:40effect
2:41it's really nice for everyday look because it looks nice and natural and
2:45there's no shimmer or highlight happening it whatsoever
2:49I always set my eye area just so that that doesn't move around whatsoever
2:53now i'm going to go in with benefit give me brow gimme brow
2:56sorry give me about the tiniest little itty-bitty brush of life
3:00I'm gonna go in and just brush through my natural brow hair
3:03I love gimme brow because it has fibers and it adheres to your natural brow hair
3:08so not only do they still and it makes it look fuller instantly
3:12it is such a genius product and because the brush is so tiny it grabs on to
3:16every single little baby hair
3:18it is so so fast so double grass and i'm going to go in with makeup geek creme
3:24brulee eyeshadow
3:25you can use any eyeshadow you want or bronzer whatever you prefer this is just
3:29my go-to eyeshadow that looks nice my skin tone and I can just put it in my
3:33crease any day of the week and I'm never going to be disappointed by it we all
3:36have those go to colors and this one is mine
3:39so using an e 40 brush by Sigma this is definitely my go-to i brush when it
3:43comes to blending and buffing things out so i'm just going from inner corner to
3:47outer corner and it's just going to contour our eyes so we don't look like
3:50we're sleeping
3:51I'm going to curl my lashes any lash curler will be just fine as long as you
3:55like it and I get a couple of pulses squeeze squeeze squeeze
3:58and I'm good to go i'm gonna go in with l'oreal voluminous original mascara in
4:03the shade black and make sure that when you're applying your mascara you really
4:06wiggle especially at the root of your lashes
4:09it's a little trick that we all use just like you tease your hair for fullness
4:13you want to tease your lashes for fullness as well so really go back and
4:16forth and wiggle at the root of those lashes and then drag it down straight
4:20work if that makes sense then we're going to go in with mac care blend
4:25pressed powder in the shade dark this is my go-to bronzing powder right now and
4:29i'm using a big fat fluffy brush and I'm going to just bronze in the outer
4:33portion of my cheeks as you can see i shake off a lot of the excess
4:37this will help / bronzing any streaking or muddiness that could happen on the
4:41face so I'm just going to bring the cheek area and then around the forehead
4:45just to even it out don't neglect your forehead when bronzing because it can
4:49look a little weird
4:50I'm going with matt spring sheet i always choose a blush
4:53it has a really nice shimmer in it because on days like today I'm not going
4:56to be doing the whole highlighting and contouring so using a brush like this
5:00already has some shimmer in it will help to highlight and a more subtle way and
5:05not just like BAM streaks of highlight on the cheeks then i go over with that
5:09well rested
5:10again whatever is left on that brush and this is just a trick to buff things out
5:14so you don't have any harshness and it looks airbrushed on the cheeks
5:18now we're going to go in with mac sure we're going to just dad this underneath
5:22that brow
5:23this is my favorite most universal beautiful highlight shade
5:26I've loved it for
5:27years and i truly pretty much use it on everyone and going to dab and inner
5:31corner as well
5:32putting a light shimmer in the inner corner and brow will really help in
5:36making you look more awake for someone who's more mature i highly recommend
5:39mylar my mac cosmetics
5:41it doesn't have as much shimmer but it's beautiful I'm going to go in with stigma
5:44lip gloss in the shade tent
5:46this is my favorite lip gloss right now for days like today because it's pretty
5:49much the exact same color of my lips but just nice and glossy it's got that
5:53perfect little rose effect to it going to put that on and then we are all done
5:58can we get any easier I think not I love you guys thank you for watching and I'll

2:08will be available until wednesday April thirtieth which is one week from today
2:12unless it sells out beforehand
2:15I will list all of the direct links along with the discount code for you
2:18guys in my description bar below this video if any of you are interested
2:22ok let's get into the tutorial first thing I'm going to do as always is prime
2:27my eyes I'm using mac pro longwear concealer in the shade and w 20
2:32this is a little bit lighter than my natural skin tone which will really help
2:35to get a nice blank highlighted canvas as the background and make your shadow
2:38show up a little bit more intensely
2:40not to mention such a smooth surface to blend and work with your shadows on then
2:45going in with good old scotch tape
2:47we're going to take off a piece and put on the back of our hand just to get off
2:51that intense stickiness so it doesn't pull out your eye area
2:54now we're going to match up kind of winged eyeliner from the angle of your
2:57ID going toward the tail of your brow
3:00I did the same method in my smoky Cateye tutorial and it works like a charm
3:04then going with makeup geek peach smoothie and creme brulee
3:08we are going to take an e-40 brush and just dust this in our crease
3:11we're going to start in the outer corner because we prefer to have the darkest
3:15color in the outer corner and wherever you first lay your brush on the skin is
3:18where you're going to have the most pigments but we are going to blend this
3:21all the way into the inner corner and add that pigment is leaving the brush
3:25start going upward and that will help blend it out then going in with makeup
3:29geek trap
3:30we are going to take this color which is a mid-tone brown it's not as warm as the
3:34others which really helps give more dimension to the look and we are using a
3:38sigma e25 starting again and that outer crease you can go right over that tape
3:42which is what makes this look so easy just that tape makes it impossible to be
3:47too messy
3:48so just go right on that tape blind to all the way from inner and outer corner
3:51and make sure you blend it out with a clean brush another shadow by makeup
3:55geek is cocoa bear
3:56we're going to take this on the same a 25 x sigma and put this predominantly in
4:01that outer corner
4:02I know this seems like a lot of shadows but that's because it's a lot of shadows
4:05and this is going to give you the best result then going in with make a beak
4:09corrupt any black shadow will do make it because the blood
4:12shadow I've ever personally worked with before and this is a makeup geek brush
4:17I don't know the name or number of it i will sit down below in my description
4:20bar of course which is going right over top of that tape
4:23we're going to blend it in work the great thing about this is you do not
4:27have to worry about blending two perfectly because the next step will
4:30really take care of that for us
4:32so just go over with any brush you can have a little cocoa bear left on it or
4:36can be blank
4:37whatever and I just go over that black area just so that you don't have any
4:41harsh lines right in there but don't worry about blending it on your lid
4:44we're going with Too Faced shadow insurance glitter glue
4:47huh one of the best products in the world when working with intense pigments
4:51or glitters at all
4:53we're going to put this all over the lid as you can see i use my finger then
4:56we're going to go in with makeup geek
4:57it's making me kind of gay people utopia this is such an amazing pigment but
5:02listen to me when I say use a glitter glue if you don't use a glitter glue it
5:07can be a hot mess
5:08packing this all over our lid we are using a mac 242 brush because when i
5:12find working with messy intense pigments like this you're going to have the best
5:16outcome when you use the thinnest brush possible that brush is gonna take too
5:20much of it and slaughter on your face
5:22so thin brush like this we'll pack it on as you can see I'm patting i am not
5:26sweeping
5:27so you want to pat pat pat pat pat this and you want to blend and sweep your
5:32brushes when you're blending your other shadows but with this pigment just
5:35strictly Pat we did the eyes first because otherwise this will be all over
5:40our foundation
5:42so just peeling off that tape you can see shows am baby you have got an
5:46intense cat eye when you first pull it off it always looks kind of weird like
5:50okay that's a really really harsh line but you will see how we are going to
5:53blend that out
5:54you can see up close it's intense you could just pop on a pair of false lashes
5:59like this and you'll be good to go just mascara your natural lashes and you can
6:02see super pretty
6:04i'm going to show you how to do eyeliner if you're interested because it is so
6:07easy
6:08so you're going to follow that natural line at the scotch tape made taking any
6:12black liner i am using Maybelline blackest black
6:17and i'm just going to follow that exact edge and then just sculpt out my
6:21eyeliner as always
6:22whenever you are doing eyeliner over any sort of glitter sparkle chunky pigment
6:28anything along that line
6:29just be patient you're gonna have to go over a few times back and forth to make
6:33sure that it is black
6:34if you're a perfectionist like me you have to go over a lot of times because i
6:37hate glitter being on my black liner and then we're going to pop on a pair of
6:42false lashes by the Brandis quito i am not positive of the name of these so i
6:46will sit in my description bar right below this video
6:49they are very dramatic and very prominent proprietary when I got them in
6:53the mail I looked at them and I was it from
6:55oh sorry how to bust out and dance for two seconds moving on make up for ever
6:58micro perfecting primer is where i'm going to be using it's important to
7:02Prime and times where you really want to make up to
7:05last last last in this primer i do see a difference i really been enjoying it so
7:09make sure you press it into the skin has a nice yellow tent in a few different
7:13colors depending what you need
7:15now i'm going in with NARS sheer glow foundation I'm using the shade
7:19punjab and using an f-86 up kabuki brush
7:23one of these days I'm going to switch it up on you guys use a different
7:25foundation brush and you're going to be like hell froze over what's happening
7:28for right now I'm going to be using the f80 as always impressing into the skin i
7:33always start in a pressing motion and whatever is left over you can kind of
7:36move around in a sweeping motion but pressing into the skin will help it
7:39lasts the longest make sure you blend it down the jawline
7:42so you have a line of demarcation then i'm going to fill in my brows
7:46I'll put my brow video down below in the description bar i usually put all my
7:49basic videos down there in case you're curious i'm using the Anasazi or browse
7:54in the shade soft brown and then caramel for the tail
7:58so by being we're going to finish that do you whatever you want to do with your
8:01brows have fun then we're going to go in with the same concealer that we put on
8:06our eyes in the beginning
8:07mac pro longwear and w20 as you can see it's lighter than the rest of my
8:11foundation which we are going for because i want that highlighted
8:14look I'm blending it out with the sigma f 86 brush which is my holy grail
8:19foundation
8:20I'm sorry concealer brush I absolutely love this brush evening out our
8:25highlight under our eyes we are going to highlight other areas of our face
8:29using the Mac prep and prime highlighter and shade light boost which is the green
8:32yellow shade
8:33there is also one that is a pinky shade and a peach i'm going to just put this
8:37around the mouth area and then in between the eyebrows
8:41this will help so that you don't have that stark white under eye area and the
8:44rest of your face just looks kind of strange you want to balance it all out
8:48by doing this
8:49it's very quick and very easy i know it looks intense promise you
8:52then i'm going to go ahead and set that under eye concealer using macpro
8:58highlighting powder in the shape emphasize this is a stark white powder
9:02so make sure that you are not going overboard with it just a light tapping
9:06is all you need
9:07again I tap this and press this into the skin other than a sweeping motion it
9:11will help to truly absorb that powder and not crease throughout the day as
9:15opposed to when you just sweep it across the face sometimes it can settle into
9:18the fine lines even more then we're gonna go on with Smashbox suntan matte
9:24bronzer and we're going to contour using our nars eat a brush
9:28i highly recommend contouring on prom as opposed to bronzing because this will
9:33definitely show up and pictures it'll make you look nice and mature and really
9:37give you that Kim K look that everyone is going for
9:40I of course will put my contour video down below I am sculpting out my
9:44cheekbones and around the temples of my forehead and you can touch a little bit
9:47on the jaw line and blend it all out then going in with mac shroom
9:52we are going to put this right underneath our eyebrows on that brow
9:56bone and a little tip if you have issues blending your eyeshadow up on top by the
10:00brows just kind of bring this brush down and blend it into that shadow that you
10:05already have on the eye area and it will help bring it all together and we're
10:09going to put a dabble of cocoa bear which was that warm brown and our outer
10:13corner on the lower lash then going in with whatever you want creme brulee
10:17frappe anything you have just take any pencil brush and just blend back and
10:22forth back and forth
10:24this is really going to open up your eyes so i recommend you really blend
10:27don't be scared blend back and forth and really buff out this under eye area and
10:32make them look much bigger especially and photos
10:35then i'm going to use makeup geek I don't know the name of this liner for
10:40the first time in my life I'm at a loss for words
10:42I cannot remember the name of the signer it's a black gel liner i listed down
10:45below
10:46I love this for the water line because it does not move and it does not burn
10:49and those are the only two things i'm asking for life when it comes to liners
10:52then I'm going to go in with back a wild honey blush
10:56saddest day ever i'm going to just blend this all of the cheek area this is a
11:02bronzy color with a little bit of terracotta in it's so gorgeous it
11:07doesn't have a super shimmer which I don't want a really intense shimmer
11:10I want my keeps to be a little bit more mad and then we're going to go in with a
11:14highlight this is opal by becca one of my all-time favorite highlights ever in
11:20a sigma taper highlighting brush just to highlight those cheekbones this again
11:24will look absolutely beautiful and pictures you wont be over shimmery over
11:27Dewey it will be the perfect amount and photos
11:30just a little top of it on the chin Cupid's bow and nose and you're done
11:36i'm going to remove the foundation i have going on my lips and you can see
11:39how naturally pigmented my lips are
11:41it's a little intense and it's difficult for me to get new lips because of how
11:45pigmented my naturally are so we're going to go in with mac creme brulee
11:50this is a cream machine i believe so it's nice and creamy and on the sheer
11:54side and i'm going to top it off with color your smile lighted lip gloss in
11:58the shade
11:59nude if you guys have not heard of these glasses yet you need to jump on the
12:02bandwagon
12:03they're amazing and they have a mirror on the side of the lip gloss tube and
12:06they light up so you can do your lip gloss in the dark in public it is
12:10definitely a prom and all night out essential
12:12I love mine then i'm going to set the masterpiece with Urban Decay chill
12:17makeup setting spray and take a quick bath in this and we are all done
12:20i love you guys so much thank you for watching happy prom and i'll see you
12:24soon
0:13hey guys today I'm going to be doing my first holiday look I am super excited to
0:23finally be doing this oh my gosh
0:25so the story behind this yes there's a story as always so I uploaded my blog -
0:30it's a couple of days ago and if you guys watch that you can see that i have
0:33my friends in town and I like a little vacation and I got sick to top it off
0:37and it's like we're not running Cygnus
0:38but anyways because of that I haven't got around to doing quality looks and I
0:42have all these ideas and everything is so last night I was setting up my lights
0:46and everything to film this morning and I wanted to do something like really
0:49crazy colorful and glittery and the holidays and then I was like you know
0:54what
0:55yes those things might be fun but we're already in the middle of the month and I
0:58thought I want to do something
1:00it's more neutral and wearable for you guys that are actually watching this
1:03video because even though it can be fun to watch something like glittering over
1:06the top but like why i like you know like not actually useful for the average
1:12woman and we're already in mid-december so it's like I figured let's just do
1:16something that like you guys can actually take tips from you guys can
1:20actually use for yourself at home you're saying so I i love this look it's like a
1:25very soft cut crease
1:26we have some glitter in there but it's not too much not overboard
1:30I just think that this is very subtle but at the same time
1:34screams the holidays you compare this I with any lip color that you want right
1:38now i'm wearing occ lip tar in the shade
1:40harlot Marlo harlot is what i am wearing
1:45so yeah oh yeah and he's ready to thank you so much for watching i love you guys
1:49so much i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and i'll see you soon
1:52but so I'm going to be starting off priming my eyes because we are going to
1:57start with our eyes today since we are using glitter I don't start my
2:00foundation because the glitter can fall down and kind of ruin the foundation so
2:04study with eyes i'm going in with mac kid eyeshadow
2:08this is a great transition color if you're familiar with soft brown it's
2:12kind of similar just a little bit cooler and lighter in tone which i absolutely
2:15love
2:17so using an e 40 brush from sigma i'm going to concentrate this on the upper
2:20crease of my eye
2:22I'm trying to kind of avoid the lid just because we
2:25we're going to do a soft cut crease today now i'm going in with a morphy
2:28eyeshadow and this is number 62 this is a little bit darker than kid and it's
2:32very neutral in tone so it's not going to be too warm or too cool
2:36using a sigma e25 i'm going to just put that again in that upper crease area
2:41kind of trying to avoid the lid
2:43once we have that on i'm going to go in with another morphy shadow and this is
2:46number 15 which is much warmer in tone i'm going to take a makeup geek blending
2:51brush you can go in the same be 25 this was just laying there so I just used it
2:54for you no no really different reason
2:56but i'm going to again to the exact same thing with this and I'm going to just
2:59start buffing everything upward again just avoiding that lid board the fact
3:04that we are doing a soft cut crease then I go in with an e 40 from sigma always
3:09this is like the magic wand in my collection
3:11just to buff everything out and make sure that we have no harsh lines and
3:14then i'm going to go in with mac shroom
3:17this is very loved in my house as you can see i go through probably i would
3:21say one of these a year because I just absolutely love it
3:23it's gorgeous all over the lid it's gorgeous as a brow bone highlight as a
3:26chick highlight it works pretty much on all skin tones
3:29it's just a great color so using a 242 brush from Mac I'm going to just press
3:34this all over the lid and going to help it to carve helped carve out of that lid
3:39area even more so we have more of a defined cut crease as you can see i will
3:44push that up on the entire lid up into that crease area to kind of erase some
3:48of the brown fell down on our lid
3:51this will just help define it just a little bit more and then as always I
3:54will go back with a blending brush and just ever so slightly
3:57make sure that we have no harsh lines because even though i'm doing a slight
4:00cut crease I still don't want to be too harsh
4:03so now taking a makeup geek pencil brush and makeup geek corrupt eyeshadow which
4:08is a very black intense shadow
4:10i'm going to just ever so slightly press the shadow on my upper lash line only on
4:15the outer corner of my eye
4:17this will give kind of like a romantic soft smokey effect but I love doing this
4:23only on the outer corner and leaving the inner corner blank because I just think
4:26that it really gives you like that cat eye and it's just very romantic as
4:30opposed to lining everything which can be a little bit more dramatic and a
4:33little bit more harsh
4:34Plus this brush makes this step just like foolproof
4:37anyone can do it I'm going to go with a pencil brush and literally just above it
4:41back and forth with really no rhyme or reason just so that it's not harsh
4:44whatsoever because i do not want it to be too black or too intense at all i
4:48want to be nice and soft and subtle
4:51so now for the fun part i'm going to be going in with mac cosmetics loose
4:55glitter and this is in the shade reflects pearl
4:58this is a mac pro item mine is from an old wonder woman collection but you can
5:02still get it online on just the regular mac cosmetics website to add here that
5:06to the eyes i am using two faced shadow insurance and glitter glue
5:09I put it in the back of my hand and then I kind of pick it up with a 242 brush
5:13anything that's flat and I press that glitter all over the lid and then I
5:17immediately put my brush in the glitter and I start dabbing if you do this your
5:22glitter will not move it will not fall on your face
5:25it will not crease this glitter glue is everything
5:28there are many different brands that have glitter glue but i just love this
5:30one it's like my tried-and-true it literally is like super glue for glitter
5:35i absolutely love it i've never had an issue with it so i put it all over my
5:38lid and then immediately within 10 seconds
5:41I pack on that glitter well it's still tacky now i'm going to go in with
5:44flutter lashes in the style
5:46Kim oh my gosh i love these lashes
5:50they are so fun they're like have these lashes so they're not going to go on
5:54your entire lash line
5:55they're only gonna go on the outer corner but they are so cool I was not
5:59expecting to love them as much as I do but look at how awesome that is like
6:03it's just a little extra something so i didn't want to go overboard the lashes
6:07because i wanted the inner corner to be nice and subtle and kind of blank and I
6:11wanted the outer corner to have more like a romantic kind of flirty vibe so I
6:15love these lashes for that purpose
6:17I'm going to be priming my face and I'm using our glass of ale and I'm gonna rub
6:21that all over and then i'm going to go in with the what do you know the same
6:25foundation is always
6:26giorgio armani luminous silk i'm using shade 6.5 and no it does not match my
6:32face whatsoever but it does match my neck and that is what we want to color
6:36match it with I need to get my selfless tanner on though because this is not a
6:41good look for me
6:42so yeah I need to remind me to do that later thank you moving on i'm going to
6:46go ahead and conceal my under eye area
6:48i'm using mac pro longwear concealer which is
6:50try to intrude absolute favorite concealer ever ever ever ever for the
6:55under eye area
6:56I'm mixing shades nw20 and NW 25 just to get my perfect color i really wish that
7:01they would make like an NW 22.5 because hello
7:05I need up in here using a damp Beauty Blender I'm going to blend that
7:08concealer out towards the temple is just to kind of give a slight sculpted lifted
7:12look to the face
7:14i'm going to set my under eye concealer as always i'm using anastacio banana
7:18powder from her contour kit
7:19I also mix it with mac pro emphasize shaping powder i am using a tapered
7:24highlighting brush from sigma which is ideal for the under eye area and i'm
7:28going to use a mineralized skin finish from mac and shade medium plus and i'm
7:32just going to put powder on my nose because i don't like a shiny nose
7:36I'm totally out of focus here for my brows so i'm going to move right past
7:39that because i just did a video and i will link it down below
7:43so after my brows I am highlighting my brow bone using the same car that we use
7:47on the lid which is shroom by Mac then to finish off the eye area
7:52I'm going to take the same black shadow from makeup geek and i'm going to just
7:55put that only on the outer corner of my lower lash line and then buff it out
7:59with a pencil brush as you can see it took 2 seconds
8:03I don't really want it to be perfect on there i want to be a little messy just
8:06to kind of give that soft romantic feel
8:09and on the inner corner i'm going to highlight as well using any highlight
8:13that you want i think im using shroom here i might be using crystal avalanche
8:17because they're right next to each other my palate but whatever you want i'm
8:20putting a quick coat of mascara on my lower lashes
8:23i'm using a rimmel lash accelerator from the drugstore
8:27so that is our completed I look and now to finish this off we will move to the
8:30face
8:31i'm going to use a mac studio careful and pressed powder in the shade dark
8:34which is technically a face powder but like I've said many times before i love
8:39using face powders for sculpting the face because i think that they usually
8:42are the softest ones and most blendable since they are designed to be a full
8:46coverage foundation
8:47I typically like those the best for contour e so using a makeup geek blush
8:51brush I believe this is I'm going to just put this on the temples in a
8:54contour a little bit we're going to go in with a more fee and b5 and just buff
8:59all this out so that it looks more like bronze and not like LA
9:03in your face contour I'm going to go in with becca flower child
9:06I wanted some pinky cheeks and i am going to be using the morphe what is
9:12this this is the more feet
9:13mm no g8 the morphe GA as my blush brush i absolutely love this brush for blush
9:19it's like my favorite right now for highlight i'm going to go in with
9:22artists couture
9:24this is the diamond glow powder and i am going to be mixing the shade conceded
9:29and yeah as I give myself seriously want to say that I'm going to be mixing those
9:35two colors and highlighting my cheekbones
9:37I'm gonna be honest this looks way better in person the camera is picking
9:41it up very chunky which I am NOT happy about but in person these really are
9:45very beautiful
9:47to complete this look you can pair any lip color you want but i did choose to
9:51use occ lip tar in the shade harlot and i will put the lip liner that imac shit
9:56with in the description box down below so that completes this tutorial i hope
9:59you guys enjoy i love you so much
10:01happy holidays and i'll see you soon bye guys
0:13hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial and honestly I have no
0:21idea what i'm calling this yet I am so scatterbrained right now I just
0:24literally grab some eyeshadow sat down and just fill this as i was coming up
0:29with it in the mirror so typically i am much more thought-out and put together
0:32before I fill my tutorial for you but this was just like I was inspired to do
0:37this because twice yesterday i saw in a magazine article and on the TV show how
0:42orange eyeshadow is so I'm trying for summer but so many people are
0:46intimidated by the color and don't know how to wear it so I was like I got it
0:50because if you watch my channel and if you are new to my channel the first
0:53thing you should know about me is I am orange obsessed anything warm brown
0:57orange corals gold yellows
0:59I just I love itself about that I would do a tutorial for you guys showing you
1:05how all of you can get an orange eyeshadow look that is not overwhelming
1:08not gonna be scary and it's going to come with all I shades this look is
1:12really going to make light eyes such as mine blue green hazel eyes really bright
1:16and really stand out there very complimentary sorry I'm like talking so
1:20much with my hands
1:21way too enthused about this situation my personal favorite eye color for this
1:25look though is brown eyes
1:27anytime that I use the shadows on a brown eyed girl
1:30oh so beautiful it will just make the honey stand out in your brown eyes and
1:35just really shine through
1:37so this really will look good on all I colors and as you'll see the tutorial it
1:41is so easy to achieve
1:43so I'm going to stop rambling and one of you guys enjoy this video sorry for
1:45being a little over the place in a little wacky Jackie is always i love you
1:49guys so much thanks for watching and I'll see you later
1:51hey guys so the first thing I'm going to be doing today is applying lip balm i am
1:56using the sugar lip treatment it's always a good idea to moisturize your
1:59lips before you apply your makeup so they don't get dried out then i'm using
2:03an oldie but a goodie
2:04L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation I'm using my Sigma f80 flat top kabuki brush
2:09to press this into my skin
2:11this foundation is ideal for somebody who is dry to normal and skin type
2:15because it has such a beautiful dewy luminosity to it it does not have any
2:20glitter or any shimmer or Sparkle and it
2:23just gives a really dewy fresh face glow
2:26I absolutely love it it is from the drugstore but feels much more like a
2:29high-end luxurious foundation it is beautiful on the skin
2:33then we're going to go in with mac pro longwear concealer and i'm going to tap
2:37this starting an inner corner of my eye
2:39lightly dragging it down make sure you're very careful towards the temple
2:42and then going in with sigma f 86
2:45this is not technically a concealer brush but i use it as a concealer brush
2:49because since it has the synthetic fibers it really soaks up the excess
2:53concealer
2:54so if you're somebody who can accidentally be too heavy-handed on your
2:57concealer application
2:59this will really soak up the excess product so that you won't have creasing
3:02or cake under eye area then we are going to go in with mac pro soft focus which
3:08is the yellow shade and emphasize which is the white one and we're going to mix
3:12them together and just tap this underneath the eye area to set that
3:16concealer using a sigma tapered highlighter brush I use this brush for
3:20many different things and this is one of them
3:22i am currently out of my anastacio banana color powder so i am using the
3:26soft focus one instead which is absolutely ideal for anybody who is a
3:31little bit darker and skin tone of the meat but I'm making it work then I'm
3:34going to fill in my brows just like normal and i'm using anastacio browse
3:39now i am using oh yeah look at the difference in those brows baby i am
3:42using a different shade accidentally like i told you i'm a little over the
3:46place today
3:47accidentally using the wrong shade to fill in my brows so because of that they
3:51come out looking a little ashy today but we can see past that and just move right
3:55along and filling them in like normal though no intense like shaping or
3:59anything just a typical brow
4:01Phil situation then we're gonna move on to eye shadow i'm using makeup geek
4:05peach smoothie and a sigma e40 fluffy brush and I'm going to dust this from
4:09inner corner to outer corner
4:11as you can see i am a lightly building it up but I'm starting off with just a
4:14tiny amount of eyeshadow and just making it more intense as we go
4:19it is so important to start off with a light color like this
4:22higher up and the crease this will really make it so that your blending
4:26just comes out perfectly
4:27start with a light color first then move downward and darker shapes going on with
4:32makeup geek
4:33chickity and an e 35 brush any 35 brush is a more tapered brush it has less
4:38hairs and it is longer so it's going to blend a little bit more precisely and
4:43get deeply in that crease so I'm going all the way from inner corner to outer
4:47corner back and forth and windshield wiper motions them back with the e-40 to
4:52buff it out you can use more peach smoothie if you want you don't have to
4:55just make sure you blend blend blend and windshield wiper motions
4:58this is a part of the tutorial where accidentally didn't record the majority
5:02of applying eyeshadow
5:04so i'm going to explain to you exactly what i do i am using makeup geek
5:08glamorous eyeshadow as you can see right here in this clip it is a beautiful
5:12bronzy gold shade it is more of a rose gold with some copper tones in it is
5:17absolutely gorgeous
5:18we're putting that all over the lid from inner corner to outer corner then we're
5:22going to take makeup geek gold digger eyeshadow
5:25we're going to put that on top of the shade glamorous and the ball of our eyes
5:29so right in the center of that lid we're going to put gold digger or top just to
5:32get a pop so now you have that bronzy copper and gold going on on that lid
5:38then we're gonna mix
5:39tickety and cocoa bear and rub that all over the lower lash line and then last
5:43but not least we're going to highlight the inner corner and the brow with becca
5:47opal highlighter such an amazing highlighter look at that thing
5:52it's beaming it's amazing and then we are going to get back to reality
5:56okay we are now applying the lower lashes and whisper sweet nothings
6:01these are like my top three favorite lashes of life I just absolutely love
6:04them and i am using a different glue than normal this is a house of lashes
6:09I ran out of my duo glue this month and so i have been using this for a few
6:12weeks and so far i really really love it
6:15so no liner just lashes then I'm going to take that gold digger shade on any
6:21brush that you choose and I'm going to push on my lower waterline if you let me
6:26push the water line will flip out and you can get an easier application
6:29without causing wrinkles and tugging on that lower waterline
6:32it might seem weird that I'm using
6:34eyeshadow instead of eyeliner but for people who have sensitive eyes eyeshadow
6:38can actually work better because it doesn't hurt or burn your eyes at all as
6:41opposed to some liners and it really will stay for a long time and I was
6:46going to call my lower lashes with lashes with mascara black mascara and
6:50this should be your eye looks so far so very gold very warm not overboard in the
6:55orange right
6:56I think it's the perfect amount of orange then we're going to go in with
7:00math care blend press powder in the shade dark using the NARS eat a brush
7:05I'm going to lightly contour i do not want to do a heavy contouring but i do
7:09want to do a little so we are just going to buff this out on the cheekbone and
7:13then around the temples and the hairline
7:16I typically don't like to go too far down on my forehead i like to leave a
7:20nice circle in the center of the forehead as a highlight and then I just
7:23contour by the hair line on the outer portions of my forehead
7:28make sure you blend then we're going to go in with backup cosmetics songbird
7:32blush
7:33this is such a pretty color we are going to start an apple of the cheeks and just
7:37work backward blending into that contour and a going backward on the face towards
7:42the temple to make sure you lightly dust and blend and then we're going to go in
7:46with mac global glow
7:48this is a newer highlighter to mac and this is my first time using it and as
7:52you can see i am already a fan
7:55this is really beautiful on someone with my skin tone over top of a blush if you
7:59want to use this as a specific highlight on the face
8:02you're going to be a few shades Tanner that I am now we're going to go in with
8:05the mac limited edition lipstick in the shade would rose
8:09this is very similar to blankety so it would be ideal for somebody who is again
8:13a shade or two darker and skin tone than me i'm getting all you ten girls many
8:18recommendations throughout this video then i'm going to go over that with
8:21color your smile
8:23coral crazy which is a new lip gloss by them it is a nudie peachy
8:28pinky coral shade it is absolutely beautiful
8:31so after that your look is complete I hope that you guys enjoyed this video
8:35I love you so much as a way to talk to you soon bye
0:13hey guys today I'm finally going to be doing a makeup tutorial using the morphe
0:1835o palette and I am so excited to be doing this you guys because it is so
0:22highly requested not to mention i'm using this palette off-camera literally
0:27almost every single time I do my makeup i'll use at least a shade or two because
0:30I'm still in love with it but I haven't been able to do a tutorial on it because
0:34the fact that it has been sold out for the past six to eight weeks so it is
0:38finally back in stock and I wanted the time I video out so the day came back in
0:42stock is the day I feel my video on with life so that is why it has taken me a
0:47long time to film this video but this is the 350 palette right here as you can
0:51see it is a fall
0:52I shadow dream I mean at least it's my dream when I saw this palette it was
0:56like like you know the heart I'd emoji
1:00that was me in the 350 when we first connected it was a very very magical
1:04little bit past couple of months
1:05I feel like more feet pallets have been like on steroids like I am so
1:10ridiculously impressed with how pigmented and smooth and buttery
1:15it's been a while reviews that word I want to sit here and tell you that morph
1:18use the exact same qualities like makeup geek but i will say that they are
1:22getting closer and closer with every palate because this palette really
1:26impresses me
1:27I did reach out to more fee and I just straight up asked them if they would be
1:29willing to give you guys a little bit more of a discount code because of the
1:33fact that I post this on Instagram about two months ago
1:35rating about how much I loved it and coincidentally the pallets sold out
1:39literally like 15 or 20 minutes later and so many disappointed comments and
1:43tweets and even emails that i asked them if they'd be willing to give you guys a
1:47little bit more of a discount code to help make up for the fact that i did
1:50post about it and then it was just gone
1:52so they did agree to get you guys fifteen percent off and this is only
1:55gonna last for five days because they do not do fifty percent off my normal
2:00discount code jack attack is only for ten percent and that is an affiliation
2:03code but they are going to up it to an extra five percent for you guys
2:07just for a limited time of five days for those of you who really really want to
2:11get this palette but you couldn't so I hope that that's is exciting to you guys
2:15because i was really excited when they agreed to it because i know its hands of
2:19you were really disappointed about not getting this
2:21keep in mind this palette does sell out again it is a permanent items palette is
2:26not going to be gone forever does sell out a couple of times they will keep
2:29coming back
2:30it's not limited edition so don't worry you will be able to get your paws on i
2:33have some point so yeah that's not I'm translators anything else I have to say
2:38oh yeah i did get a spray tan earlier this week and you know i like the way it
2:42came out of my body my skin on my face is not having it and I literally have
2:46like alligator skin and has dry patches all over the place
2:50so in the tutorial if you're wondering what the heck is going on with her skin
2:54it's just my spray tan is all going to be okay i'm sure my skin will be back
2:57from on a couple of days
2:59I don't know why I'm talking about such first world problems right now I you
3:02guys enjoy the video
3:03let's just get into it okay okay my thanks and gave me alligators and there
3:08are people dying in the world Jacqueline
3:10hi everybody so today we're going to be starting off with our skin first and i'm
3:15going to be priming using the new backup backlight priming filter that's a
3:19mouthful
3:20I am loving this primer because it gives your skin such intense luminosity which
3:25is great for someone like me who's looking for the glow who has dry skin
3:28etc so once i have that on i'm going to go in with foundation and i'm going to
3:31be using the Makeup Forever ultra HD stick this has been one of my favorites
3:35for the past month or so
3:36so I'm going to put a line on my chin and two lines on my cheeks that I'm
3:40gonna grab some mac fix+ and more feet foundation brush this is M 439
3:44I'm going to give it a couple of spritz and then i'm going to just buff this out
3:49this foundation is super creamy it's very dewy so if your oily i would
3:52suggest probably staying away from this one because it definitely is going to
3:56give you a luminous dewy finish which is why i love it because I feel looks very
3:59natural on my skin since I am dry to normal
4:03so if you're looking for a dewy foundation the last for a really long
4:06time i would highly suggest this one I love it and a little bit goes a very
4:09long way and it's a medium coverage which is great because recently I
4:13haven't been inside the full intense coverage like I used to
4:16so now i'm going to conceal my under eye area and i'm using the Urban Decay
4:19ultimate coverage concealers that's what it's called about sure but you guys know
4:23what i mean i'll link it down below this is my absolute favorite concealer at the
4:26moment I honestly think it's my favorite concealer of all
4:28I'm you guys it's just so high coverage while still remaining hydrating because
4:33sometimes a really high coverage concealer can get really dry on the
4:36under eye area and make it look kind of creepy and unsettling even more
4:40this is just like the perfect amount of hydration while still being full
4:43coverage so i love it i am using a real techniques damp beauty sponge to blend
4:48this out and then i'm going to go in and set the entire under eye area using the
4:53Kat Von D shade light palette this is her highlight contour kit and these to
4:57highlight shades are basically my favorite highlight shades ever i really
5:01wish that she would sell these individually and not just in the kit
5:03because i would buy them in the pan like hot cakes because i love the formula of
5:08these so much so I'm going to make sure i said that entire area in the v all the
5:12way down the side of my nose up towards the temple and then i'll also dust it
5:15over the eye area that way at prime is my eyes for shadow and shadow will go on
5:20a lot smoother
5:21so now we're going to go in with the morphe 35o and we're going to pick up
5:24this first shade right here and we're going to mix it with the other one that
5:27I'm pointing out that they don't have names so I'm just like this one and this
5:30one
5:31it's like a light brown and a medium tone brown one is a very neutral and a
5:35little bit more is like a camel e warm shade so going in initially with the m4
5:40for one brush this is my morphe it's kind of a long haired blending brush I'm
5:44going to put this right in my crease all the way in the inner corner and blend
5:48out all the way to the outer corner
5:50add the product begins to leave my brush I'm then going to go upwards and start
5:53buffing this out towards my eyebrow
5:56then I'm going to pick up this kind of burnt reddish shade very warm one of my
6:01favorites it reminds me of like a mack brown script or a makeup geek cocoa bear
6:05and just going in with the exact same & 441 brush I'm going to begin to put that
6:09right over top of the first two shades that we initially went in with and i'm
6:13going to again go back and forth and I'm really making sure i go deep into that
6:16inner corner of the eye and then all the way outward and then again
6:20buffing it up and then i'm going to go in with an even a red shade and i'm
6:24going to mix it with this one in the center of the palate
6:27this is going to give me a really really rich red brown this is what's going to
6:31bring a lot of that warmth in those red tones - this looks so if you don't like
6:34those red tones go with a more medium brown in this palette but you guys know
6:38that I can't get enough so that is what i am doing and I'm going in
6:41an e 17 brush my morphe to initially pack on this red brown color and the
6:45inner and the outer corner and then i'm going in with an m4 33 and just making
6:49sure that it's all blended out and we don't have harsh lines this
6:52East 17 brush is great if you're really looking for something small and dense
6:56you can really precisely pack on color but yet you still have some blending
6:59control it's a little bit bigger than a pencil brush so it's still have that
7:03blending shape to it which makes it so great an ideal for something like this
7:07so as you can see i'm leaving the center of my lid blank because we're going to
7:10go in and put something in the center so now i'm going to go in on those - dark
7:14Browns the very bottom and i'm going to mix those together because since i have
7:1835 colors i might as well use as many as possible so i just keep mixing them and
7:21going back in with the exact same
7:23East 17 I'm going to begin to pack that super dark color on the outer corner of
7:26the eye because I just wanted to be a little bit more intensified out there
7:30then going back in with the m4 33 which is just a great blending brush I'm going
7:34to just go over the entire area all the way from inner corner to outer corner to
7:38make sure that it's all blended out we don't have any harsh lines now picking
7:42up this pale orange shade that reminds me a lot of makeup geek tickety
7:46i'm using the same blending brush i'm just going to put this at the very top
7:49of the crease just make sure that everything is nice and blended out and
7:52we have a smooth transition and now i'm going to pick up this very bottom
7:56intense oh my gosh I don't even know what to refer to the shade as it's just
8:00gorgeous
8:01I'm wetting my brush with a little bit of fixed plus i'm going to begin to pack
8:04this color on so i wanted to be super metallic make sure that when you wet
8:08your brush with 6 plus that you don't get soaked
8:11otherwise it's going to kind of meet the purpose and you're not going to pack
8:13that much product on so just a little spritz will do
8:16and then you'll get that really intense foiled pigments had look that I'm going
8:19for
8:20so this shade as you can see is super or super warm it reminds me a lot of makeup
8:25geek flamethrower which is one of their foiled eyeshadows especially when you
8:29wet your brush with fix plus it looks like a foil shadow which is why i use
8:32fix+ so often because you can completely change your eyeshadow look with just a
8:36spritz of fix+ now i'm going to pick up a super dark color at the bottom of the
8:40palette either one of these shades would do and i'm going to use a sigma e 15
8:44definer brush to pack on the shade on to the lower lash line and I'm literally
8:48going to draw this color from the outer corner to the inner corner of my
8:52by using this definer brush and then once we have that intense dark shade on
8:57i will go in and blend this out so it's not so harsh
8:59of course otherwise it looks like you drew it on with a sharpie so picking up
9:02a little bit more of this burnt right shade and a pencil brush I'm going to
9:05just blend this out from the outer corner to the inner corner i really like
9:09my under eyes to personally be smoky I think that they open up my eyes they
9:13bring more attention to your eye color and they just give you a really intense
9:16global smokey look so I always really blend that out on the lower lash line
9:20so now i'm going to fill in my brows nothing special i'm using the Anasazi of
9:23broadway is in the shape taupe Anasazi as browse is my favorite pencil of all
9:27time when it comes to browse when I switched from the mac 12 Anastasio one
9:31it was just like that having gates open because i love it so much
9:35so I am lining my waterline with a vanilla shade pencil but i'm actually
9:39going to take that off in a minute or two and replace it with a black because
9:43i realized i wasn't feelin myself so I'm going to go in with this highlight shade
9:46and a teeny tiny little brush this is an e36 from morphe and it's ideal for
9:51highlighting your inner corner of your eyes i've been loving it recently
9:54it's the little things in life I swear to God literally so after I highlight my
9:57inner corner i'm going to pop just a little bit of that same shade only at
10:01the high point of the brow and kind of blend it downward onto the shadow itself
10:05now i'm just going to give my lashes a coat of mascara because i am going to
10:09prep them for lashes
10:10don't feel like you need to wear lashes but I'm a last girl and I wear them all
10:13the time so i'm gonna pop some on and today i am using the new Sophia lashes
10:18by Sophia chang who is known as fashionista 804 here on Instagram she
10:22collaborated with velour to make these lashes and i have to say they're one of
10:25my favorite styles by them i love them so much and i will definitely be showing
10:29you guys them again because they are so gorgeous
10:33perfect for a smoky eye I've been wearing them with minor without liner on
10:37a day-to-day basis on a smoky basis so I'm all about these lashes right now
10:40congratulations girl
10:42so I am a scurrying my love mascara i am putting mascara on my lower lashes and
10:47then i'm going in with some eyeliner this is the ardency Inn eyeliner in
10:51black because I realized I was not liking that vanilla liner I wanted
10:55something a little bit smoke year so I went over it with a black kohl little
10:58bit and just completely cover it up and made it darker and smoke year which i
11:02liked way better
11:03and then I go back and with that same Sigma
11:0515 definer brush and just kind of smoke out and blend out that liner
11:09since you can't see what I'm doing some looking straight down i'm explaining it
11:11to you instead
11:13so now for cheeks i'm going to be using the mac cosmetics sculpting powder in
11:17the shade shade stirrer which I've talked about a few times i love it so
11:21much and i am using the NARS eat a brush which I have really fallen in love with
11:25recently and I'm going to be contouring my cheeks and I'm doing kind of a hike
11:28on tour today meaning i am sculpting starting a little bit higher by the ear
11:33and bring it down a more intense decline down by the mouth because i wanted to
11:38get that kind of sharp intense contour and i'm just going to blend that around
11:41on the forehead and i'm going to pick up some of the laura mercier translucent
11:45powder and then i am using this intense sculpting brush from morphe and what I'm
11:49going to do is put this powder right underneath my contour and I'm going to
11:53blend it all the way down on the rest of the face by the jaw bone
11:56this is going to set that powder so that I'm sorry set that foundation so that it
12:00doesn't wear off throughout the day because my foundation always leave the
12:03lower half of my face because I'm like leaning on my arm or something and I'm
12:07going to go in and blend all of that out and just immediately erase it so that
12:11everything is nice and set and sharp sharp and then i'm going to go in with
12:16some blush and this is the NARS luster blush and i'm using the morphe e4 blush
12:21brush
12:21I love this blush I don't know how old it is I don't even know if it's still
12:25available but if it is i will link it down below if i can find it but i have
12:28been loving it
12:29and now i'm going to highlight my cheeks using what do you what do you know
12:33champagne pop I'm so surprised i'm so surprised i'm using champagne pop aren't
12:36you using a more fee and 50 1 i'm going to just dust this all over the very high
12:41points of my cheeks and then blending it downward today I'm keeping it more on
12:45the high points and not so much on the apples
12:48I usually blend it down there but not today i'm going to go in with a very
12:51nude lip to begin
12:53I wanted to show you guys options so this is occ lip tar in the shade
12:57interlace and i'm going to go over it with one of my favorite with glasses at
13:00the moment which is nars Chelsea girl so you can see what this look would look
13:04like if you chose to do a nude lip
13:07i personally like this i think it's very pretty but i wanted to do something a
13:10little more dramatic because i rarely do bold and bold but recently I've been
13:14having fun with these fall looks so i'm going to show you what it looks like
13:17when we go to a bold lip
13:18and bull dies so i am using the Anasazi lip tar lip paint
13:23I'm sorry in the shade vamp and i'm going to put that all over my entire
13:27lips as normal
13:29I'm not going to go too hard on the center of the lip though because I'm
13:31about to cover that up with a little bit of a person and i am going to just dab
13:35this right in the center of the lip and tapping motions on the bottom and then
13:39I'm going to take my finger
13:41once I have this tapped all over the center and i'm going to begin to just
13:45kind of balance my finger up and down on my lips to blend this out we're doing an
13:48ombre lip but I didn't want it to be too intense or over the top
13:52so I'm just pouting and buffing this out with the tip of my finger and I want the
13:56most intense of this brightness to be in the very very center of the lip like you
14:01just got them sucking on a strawberry
14:03that's how it's supposed to look so what we've done that I'm going to set my base
14:07with Urban Decay Jill makeup setting spray and this look is complete

1:53requested I know you guys want to see it so i'll do it for you but this look is
1:56something i will personally wear again for sure

2:07appropriate if you want to darken it up and they get more sexy
2:11he's not work on camera just so uncomfortable with like you want to make

2:25thank you so much for watching and love you guys go follow Kathleen I'll see you
2:29soon bye
2:29first thing I'm going to do is prime my face i'm using makeup forever radiance
2:34primer using clean fingers of course because we do not want to spread any
2:37bacteria or germs
2:38I'm going to massages all over my entire face then I'm going to take the same
2:43makeup forever line using the smoothing primer
2:46I'm going to take this and just rub it in my t-zone I know this seems excessive
2:50to use two primers but I've just been loving the way it makes my skin look
2:53recently them for extra hydration because i am dry i'm going to spread
2:57some max mac fix+ all over my face and I'm going to go in with my foundation
3:01I've been loving the dior new dare serum foundation recently I've raved about a
3:05couple of times it's just my absolute favorite at the moment it's a shared
3:08medium coverage just looks so natural and blends beautifully and i am using
3:12the Sigma f80 flat top kabuki to just massage that and blend it all over my
3:17entire face then we are going to go in with urban decay and naked concealer
3:22I'm going to put this in the entire under eye area and a triangle shape kind
3:26of down the side of my nose and up towards my temple and i will also put on
3:30my eyelid and i will blend that out with a damp Beauty Blender
3:34the reason i put on my eyelid is because it will help me prime for eyeshadow i
3:37don't usually use an actual eye shadow primer
3:40this is my way of priming and color correcting at the same time I'm gonna
3:43take that same highlighter
3:44i'm going to put on the top to the cheeks the chin the Cupid's bow the
3:47center of the nose and make a little flower in the center of my forehead as
3:50well just to kind of even out that very subtle highlight it's not that light but
3:55it's kind of then i'm going to set the under eye area with some powder and move
3:59forward
3:59i'm going in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow as my first shade i
4:04am using a sigma e40 eyeshadow brush to blend this out
4:07this is just an absolute must color for me it just works so great with my skin
4:11tone and it works for a transition shade to make all the colors that i use blend
4:15seamlessly
4:16it just works for my skin tone it might not work for everyone but i honestly
4:19can't live without it
4:20now i'm going to go in with ardency Inn eyeliner and this is in the shade
4:24black what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to smudge this all along my
4:27lash line just very messily not doing anything in particular
4:31then with any brush this is a morphe brush ride on the number i'm sorry but
4:35i'm going to just blend this out back and forth and you do not have to make it
4:39a seamless blending application just blending it upwards
4:42this is going to help give our lash line depth when we go in with more shades
4:46now i'm going to go in with the first shade which is called Cornelius
4:50I'm going to go in with an e 25 brush from sigma and just put that in the
4:53entire crease area going back and forth and windshield wiper motions all the way
4:57to the inner corner all the way to the outer corner back and forth I want this
5:01to be just as dark in the inner corner as I do in the outer corner
5:04I really want this to be very rounded and very smoky
5:07now i'm going to go in with my favorite color which is blaze i'm using my finger
5:10to apply this because honestly it's just what's going to work best so why not use
5:14the best tools that God gave you so using my minutes
5:17middle finger I'm going to rub that in the eye shadow and Pat it all over my
5:20entire lid
5:21once i have packed a good amount of that on going to go back and with the e25
5:25brush from sigma and blend it out because if you just use your finger it's
5:29going to be kind of hard not to have harsh lines so i'm going to go in just
5:33to make sure that's completely blended and then I will pack even a little bit
5:37more on the center of my lid because I wanted to be really intense in the very
5:41center of my lid then going in with the shade kathleenlights I'm going to pack
5:46this on the center of the lid as well and i'm using a mac 242 brush
5:49I don't know why I even picked up the brush it's not necessary just use your
5:52fingers for this part as well because I go back in with my fingers you can see
5:55and I kind of blend that together
5:56I just wanted an extra pop right in the center of that lid I'm going to fill in
6:00my eyebrows with anastacio browse in the shade taupe
6:03but i'm going to skip right through that because you've seen you fill my brows
6:06and it's just not fun to watch
6:08so now i'm going to take the exact same colors that i use on the upper lid and
6:12i'm going to put them on the lower lash line literally the same thing in the
6:16same order
6:16i'm going to put them on the lower lash line I'm taking the e25 from sigma and
6:20I'm going to meet that outer corner and very softly kind of smoke it out so it
6:24gives a very subtle kind of cat I appearance with that light medium brown
6:29shade as you can see it's very subtle but it kind of brings the eyes outward
6:32and upward then i'm going in with an e 15 from sigma and i'm going to go back
6:36in with the shade
6:37blaze and just coat the whole lower lash line then grabbing a pencil brush I'm
6:41going to go in with kathleen lights for just a really big
6:44full glow on top all three shades that are on the top right up on the lower
6:48lash line and then we are going to separate them by going in with a very
6:52creamy kind of ivory white pencil
6:54this is a mac pro pencil so I will link it down below for you guys in the
6:57description bar if you're having a hard time finding it i'll make it easier for
7:00you
7:01this is my favorite white pencil ever because it's not too white it's got a
7:05very kind of fleshy creamy vibe to it and it just gives a very different look
7:09when you're working with a smoky eye and makes it much more daytime appropriate
7:12then you can exchange it for a black eyeliner at night and make it more night
7:14appropriate
7:15I'm going to be going in with lashes and today I'm using a brand called wink wink
7:19lashes in the style Tribeca
7:22I love these because they're fluffy and their girly but yet they also have like
7:26kind of a spike eNOS to them and they give a lot of definition to the iso
7:29they're absolutely beautiful
7:31now i'm going to go in and cut my lower lashes with mascara
7:34whatever mascara will do my favorite lower lash mascara as always is mac
7:38duggal blacklash there's something about the wand it's just so small precise
7:41it's just my favorite for lower lashes now i'm going to go in and bronze my
7:45face
7:45well it started off with the idea of bronzing and then it kind of turned into
7:48contour
7:49whoops sorry story of my life i am using the Wayne Goss brush number 13 which is
7:54a beautiful brush for bronzer application and i am using hoola bronzer
7:57benefit to do this i'm going to just give my cheeks definition and i'm also
8:01going to sculpt the forehead as well and i will just blend until my arms hurt and
8:06my hands feel like they're going to fall off and then I'm going to go in with a
8:10lighter shade i'm using the anastacio banana powder i believe using the kat
8:15von d brush that came out with her shade light palette i'm just going to do this
8:19because this helps give just the face and more sculpted look because like i
8:22said at first I wasn't playing on contouring but then I was like I changed
8:25my mind
8:26I want to contour so here we go we're doing it I'm going to contour underneath
8:29I'm sorry highlight underneath the eyes and on the forehead as well to even
8:32everything out then going in with becca songbird blush blush is my current
8:38obsession
8:39I am so in love with it it is so absolutely ridiculously beautiful as you
8:42can see right here on camera it is just the most gorgeous war me pinky
8:46amazingness that ever happened to my cheeks
8:49now i'm going to go in with the new color pop highlighter and this is in the
8:53shade
8:53smokin whistles such a gorgeous shade so I do recommend
8:57recommend using this with your finger you can use a brush as you see me doing
9:01right here but I'm going back and forth between two morphe brushes applying this
9:03but honestly if you just use your finger
9:06it'll work absolute beautiful because I ended up just using my finger to do my
9:09chin and my Cupid's bow was kind of a smooth kind of squishy moose e
9:13water-based highlight so it is what it is
9:16use your finger you'll be good then I went in with the same Cornelius
9:19eyeshadow and just put a little bit underneath my lower lip just to give
9:22kind of a fuller powder your lower lip going on
9:24i'm going to use colour-pop lippie Stix in the shade bounded which is my
9:28favorite nude pink ever buy them and then i'm going to finish off this look
9:31with Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray and your look is complete
9:35so I hope that you guys enjoy this video thanks so much for watching I love you
9:38and I'll see you soon
0:25hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look right
0:30here
0:31obviously I'm so unprepared for this intro because i'm actually getting ready
0:35to leave for dinner i'm actually leaving in about 30 minutes from now and i
0:40thought that i would fill message like send up all my equipment and record
0:43myself getting ready for tonight because i knew i wanted to do something super
0:45dramatic so i thought was recorded make it easy so I'm very unprepared for this
0:50intro i have seen no idea i'm calling this look all I know is I came across an
0:54old photo of me and john from when I was 18 years old and I'm wearing like this
0:58exact smokey eye except there was a little little junkie but that's okay
1:03um I used to rock these colors like every day for a year and a half and when
1:07I saw this picture i was like i am not done those colors and such a long time
1:11so I felt very inspired to redo the look that used to wear and I was 18 years old
1:15so I absolutely love love the smoky eye we are working with gold and cranberries
1:20and purples
1:21it's such a pretty color combination and I made it really dramatic and really
1:25edgy as you can tell I really smoke - I made like an intense cat I knew of
1:28course the modified for your face
1:30- what fits your needs you do not have to make it as edgy and angular's I did
1:34you can soften it a little bit not as much product but you don't mean I'm
1:38going to do it all
1:39I'm gonna do it all so yeah I hope that you guys enjoy this video thank you so
1:44much for watching I Love You a season
1:46hey guys well hello
1:49let's transform this message shall we ok let's get started first thing I'm doing
1:53is priming my eyes as always
1:55and i still use the mac pro longwear concealer because it's just my absolute
1:58favorite way to prime my eyes ever
2:01then I'm going to be going in with the one the only scotch tape
2:04any brand of table work but i'm using scotch just using a tiny bit like an
2:08inch inch and a half of tape and I'm going to put on the back of my hand
2:11I'm going to peel off put on my hand again peeled off again this is just
2:14going to take a little bit of the stickiness away so it's not too harsh on
2:17the eye area
2:18what I'm going to do is put this underneath the eye and a diagonal line
2:21from the corner of my eye up to my brow really focusing and concentrating
2:24because I want them to be as symmetrical as possible because it'll make your life
2:27a whole lot easier if they're symmetrical to begin with
2:30I'm going to go in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow I know I know
2:34ok
2:34you can use maxima silk bamboo you can use bobby brown toast they all have a
2:39similar vibe to them but makeup geek peach smoothie
2:41that is like my ride or die that's my girl so I'm going to blend that in the
2:44entire crease from inner corner to outer corner and then I'm going to go and with
2:47makeup geek creme brulee
2:49this is another go to shade for me and that personally works for my skin tone
2:52for a great transition color and my crease
2:55whatever works for you will ever go to call that you have in your collection
2:57that will work just fine for this look so i am using a sigma e40 to blend this
3:01back and forth all the way from the inner corner to outer corner and then
3:05i'm going to go in with a little bit more precise brush I'm using the morphe
3:08em for three three for this
3:10you can also use a sigma e25 if you have that brush as well and i'm just going
3:13back in with creme brulee and the crease just to make it a little bit more dark
3:16then i'm going to be going in with an emergency in shadow and the shade copper
3:20I don't know why this is called copper because as you can see it is not a
3:23copper color
3:24i did a wet in my mac 242 brush with a little bit of fix plus because I wanted
3:28just to be super metallic and very vibrant and shiny and I inner corner
3:32this is a beautiful pure gold like it looks like a bar of gold which is why I
3:37love it so so much so i'm going to put that on the whole inner corner area and
3:41then just kind of fade out in the middle of the lid
3:44I'm not going to cover my entire lid with this just focusing on the inner
3:47corner of the eye then i'm going to go in with one of my old school all time
3:50favorites this is Mac copper ring eye shadow
3:53I told you guys before how back in my mac days other fellow like employees
3:57would call me copper ring because I would wear this every single day that it
4:01became my nickname
4:02so using that same 242 brush I'm going to pack that right over top of that gold
4:06and the center of the lid and then i'm going to go in with one of my favorite
4:10Purple's of all time and this is deep damson again this is by Mac this is a
4:15pro color i believe it's still a pro color I don't know if matt has changed
4:18in the last couple of years but you can get on that cosmetics . com just like
4:21anything else that is a pro product so using a pencil brush i am just going to
4:25really focus this on that outer crease of my eye
4:28this is where that tape really comes in handy because you can be as messy as you
4:31want to be and that tape is going to keep it nice and sharp and clean for you
4:35which is why i absolutely love this method so as you can see i'm just
4:38packing it all over that outer corner kind of focusing on that v-shape and
4:42then taking it up into the crease try to keep this purple as low as possible in
4:46your crease and don't take it too
4:47initially because as we start to blend it will begin to go higher and higher so
4:51try to initially keep that purple nice and low
4:54that way the more you blend the higher it goes i am using the morphe and 433
4:58brush to again
4:59blend this up and then I'll go back in with the sigma e40 just to make sure
5:03that there are no harsh lines you know how it is you go from bottom to top and
5:07then you blend blend blend you want to use the smaller blending brushes for the
5:10bottom and the bigger for the top so as you see I'm using a pencil brush now
5:13then i'll go and with the morphe and 433 then i'll go on with the bigger the e-40
5:17picking up a little bit of cocoa bear by makeup geek now which is another one of
5:21my absolute favorite shadows
5:23we're going to put just a little bit of that in the crease area because I felt
5:26like that purple wasn't blending as seamlessly as I wanted it to
5:29so sometimes picking up another shade will just really help with the blending
5:33process making it look super smooth which is why i use that now i'm going to
5:37go back and was a little bit more coppering because in that blending
5:39process
5:40I felt like I kind of lost the pop of that copper shade and I really want to
5:44have a nice gradient transition from gold to copper to purple
5:47so we're going to touch that up in the center of the lid now i'm going to go
5:50ahead and remove the scotch tape and you can see the big reveal of what we have
5:55on that outer corner now due to the scotch tape
5:58i'm going to use a face wipe any sort of makeup remover will do and i'm just
6:03going to clean up this under eye area because you'll see like everything kind
6:06of disappear we had tons and tons of fault that you don't always notice but
6:09when you have that scotch tape you can really see all that follow on the cheek
6:12so i'm going to remove all of the fall that we have that i'm going to go in
6:16with a q-tip because sometimes using scotch tape that line can be super duper
6:21harsh
6:22so using a clean cotton q-tip i will just go in and kind of rub back and
6:26forth and this will soften that line so that it's not like whoa that's intense
6:30and I'm saying it will make it just a little bit softer on the outer edges
6:34now i'm going to be doing my finer i'm using Maybelline as always this is like
6:38my favorite eyeliner ever it is from the drugstore the price is right and I swear
6:42like there's no i mean i've ever used that is a gel liner they're like better
6:45than this one so i am very thankful for maybelline making this liner and as you
6:50can see because we use that scotch tape to make that really precise harsh line
6:54on the edge
6:55it really acts as a great guide for your wing
6:57the liner which is awesome because it makes it that much easier now i'm going
7:01to cut my lashes and any mascara will do for this because i'm going to be going
7:04in with false lashes anyways i'm going to be using a lily lashes in the style
7:09Mykonos
7:10these are my new favorite lashes this is the fourth time I have worn the style
7:14and I'm just the one love with them they are very dramatic
7:16if you haven't heard of Lily lashes yet they are awesome i just tried them for
7:20the first time this past month and i'll link them down below for you guys who
7:23want to go ahead and check it out for yourself
7:25now i'm going to be priming my skin using and make up for ever radiance
7:28primer and the reason I'm using the radiance primer today is because I'm
7:31gonna be going in with the LC cosmetics mikrosil foundation and as I have talked
7:36about this foundation before it is a little bit more on the dryer matte side
7:39so i like to use a radiance primer and i'm also going to spritz my brush with
7:43some mac fix+ this is the m4 39 foundation brush that I've been raving
7:47about
7:48I swear this brush the foundation are a match made in heaven
7:51and i am currently between the shade natural and sand depending if I have
7:56self tan or not I know if you people have asked about my shade in the LC
8:00foundation and if you guys are wanting to try it i do have a limited coupon
8:04code it's not going to last too much longer and i will put that down below
8:07for you guys
8:08again thank you so much too late for giving this cold because i was very
8:11generous of her
8:12so now i'm going to be filling in eyebrows i'm using the Anasazi or browse
8:16in the shade taupe and I have actually really changed the way I do my brows I
8:21make them much center now and I'm just very happy with them they're not
8:23overboard like I feel like they used to be so yay for finally feeling like my
8:28brows are getting to a happy place
8:30I'm going to be concealing my under eye area using my absolute obsession at the
8:34moment which is this Urban Decay Naked concealer i know i say in every video
8:38but i swear this like my favorite concealer of all time I think this
8:41concealer would work the best for all different skin types if you have fine
8:44lines if you have wrinkles to dry under area whatever it may be it is just an
8:48amazing amazing consider that will work for so many different people so i am
8:52using this in a shade lighter than my skin tone so because of that i will also
8:55put a little bit of it on the chin in between the eyebrows and a little dab of
8:59it on the center of the forehead as well just to balance out that highlight and
9:02other areas of my face because I don't we just want the under eyes to be a
9:05highlight i really want to kind of balances out so that it looks morning
9:09actual I know natural really huh full face of makeup but still it will
9:12actually balance out and make everything come together much more beautifully in
9:16the end and then i'm going to set my under eye area with powder so I don't
9:19have any creasing and i am using the anastacio banana powder that comes in
9:23her contour kit and it's also sold separately on her website and I mix that
9:27with the mac pro emphasize which is like a stark white powder i mix those two
9:32together from my personal perfect highlight shade and i will just go ahead
9:35and set the under eye
9:36now i'm going to go in with who faced a bronzer ok if you watch my husband tag
9:41then you know i am saying food face
9:43we're going to be going in with the to face and bronzer this is the chocolate
9:46Soleil one and i am using an oldie but a goodie and this is the NARS eat a brush
9:51you guys know that this has been like a rider die brush for me and then I wasn't
9:54using it for quite a while and i am back on the e to brush big time I love it so
9:58much for contouring i still stand behind this brush so much i just think it is
10:01amazing it's just a foolproof for contouring I swear it just makes it so
10:05simple so I also going to be browsing the forehead just to even that out as
10:09any time i contour I always have to go on the temples and the hair line just to
10:12make everything come together and i am using the morphe for brush I use this
10:16for bronzing i use it for contouring i use it for blush
10:18I've told you guys this brush is just like my favorite thing right now it's
10:22just got the smoothest bristles it's just so easy to work with
10:25now I'm going to line my waterline this is like the creepy shot ever right
10:29I was like you was so we're just gonna go ahead and cut that i use the arden
10:34see in black eyeliner to line my inner water line and then using a precision
10:39brush this is the sigma e 15 flat definer we're going to take a little bit
10:42more of that purple that deep damson i'm going to just rub that all over the
10:46lower lash line all the way from inner corner to outer corner and then taking a
10:50pencil brush this is the morphe 18 with a little bit of that copper ring shade
10:54on it
10:54I'm going to lightly dust over so we have that purple and that copper smoked
10:58out underneath the lower lash line and then i'm going to coat my lashes with
11:02mascara you can see that doing that to the lower lash line really pull this
11:06look together and just makes everything look super smoky and it makes your eyes
11:09pop
11:10i'm going to be using a mac
11:12Melba for my blush which is one of my all-time favorites it's a matte blush
11:16and it's beautiful on a very wide range of skin tones that I used to sell this
11:19blush more than any other shade when i worked at Mac because it just looks
11:23gorgeous on everybody it's so easy to wear and now of course we are going to
11:26be highlighting and i'm going to be using a champagne pop the highlighter
11:29that i created with becca cosmetics because i can't get enough of the shade
11:32right now let's get real
11:34i'm going to be using the morphe and 501 brush to apply this on the high points
11:37of my cheekbones
11:39this is my favorite highlighter brush until something better comes along this
11:42has been this has been my ride or die for my highlights and i'm also going to
11:46be taking a champagne pop and putting it right on the top of that brow bone just
11:49to kind of tie that whole look together i love how am I brow bone especially if
11:54i'm doing a super smoky look I just think that polishes it off
11:57I'm going to go in with house of dollars lipstick and the shade she is a very
12:01nude pale peachy pink as you can see extremely nude so i added a mineralized
12:06glass from Mac over top of it man a lot of a lot of mac products today
12:10I didn't mean to do that i am using the shade be nice which is a beautiful coral
12:13shade
12:14one of my favorite glosses especially by mac and then finish it off
12:17i'm going to use some fix+ and we are done
12:20call it a day I hope you guys enjoy this look thank you so much for watching you
12:24know I love you and I'll see you soon bye guys
0:00hey guys so today's tutorial is going to be on this silver and white
0:06cool tone soft cut crease perfect for the holidays
0:09thank you so much for everyone who requested a look incorporating these
0:12colors you guys totally got me out of my comfort zone so if you like what you see
0:16it go ahead and please subscribe and let's get started
0:20I was freezing while filming this video is I'm going to be wearing this gigantic
0:24robe
0:25I hope you guys don't mind I know I look a polar bear but I'm gonna start off by
0:28priming my face using the cover FX illuminating primer this is my first
0:32time using it and I actually really liked it
0:35I'm gonna be going in with the LC a mikrosil foundation and i am using the
0:39morphe and 439 foundation brush and I did spritz it with some map fix plus
0:44because mac fix+ has glycerin in it and it's ninety percent water so it just
0:48makes the skin super hydrated and actually helps the foundation to stick
0:51to your skin and to the foundation itself for concealer today i'm going to
0:55be using the new make up for ever HD concealer this is my third time now
1:00using it and I am loving this concealer it goes on very very creamy I was
1:05nervous it's going to be super Creasy when I first applied it was very very
1:08dewy and very creamy but this is like I said my third time trying it and i've
1:12set it with powder each time and i have been loving it
1:15it's very full coverage it blends out really beautifully I'm not getting any
1:18creasing throughout the day
1:20it looks nice and natural i'm i'm really loving you guys
1:23so now i'm going to set everything using the laura mercier loose translucent
1:26setting powder
1:27i'm going to make the most attractive face of life to set the under eye area
1:30as always
1:31and i'm going to run this brush across my entire face i'm going to completely a
1:34mattify myself which I actually wish I didn't do
1:37once this look was overall i wish i was a little bit do here for this specific
1:40look but that's okay because life goes on even when you have a mad face
1:44so now for the eyes and you start off using the mac shadow in the shade kid
1:48and I'm initial going in with the morphe m4 for one brush I'm going to try to
1:52keep this high up in the crease area as you can see i'm not going to go on the
1:55lid because of the fact that we're doing a cut crease the shadow kid is
1:59absolutely amazing
2:00if you are looking for an amazing a transition color that's not too warm not
2:03too cool
2:04I would really highly suggest the shade kid it's so wearable
2:08now i'm going to go in with Bobby Brown cement and as you can see this is a very
2:12nice light pale cool grey and now i'm using a smaller blending brush and this
2:17is the morphe and 433 because we're gonna get a little bit tighter in that
2:20crease as you can see i'm still not going on the lid
2:22I'm staying just in that crease area and want to keep it only in that upper
2:27crease
2:28now another bobby brown eyeshadow this is hot stone which is just a darker gray
2:32from the cement
2:33I'm really going one step at a time because when you're doing a cut crease
2:36you don't want to initially just go on like with this intense dark color it's
2:39gonna be kind of difficult to blend out so I like to start with a light shade
2:44and go one darker one darker one darker and that's really going to give you that
2:47really beautiful blended effect so that's just you know lessons and
2:51blending 101
2:52now we're going to go in with anastacio deep brown this is a very deep brown one
2:56hundred percent cool shade and now i am using the morphe and 507 and this is a
3:00very Stinney precise brush that's perfect for look like this when you're
3:04doing a cut crease so as you can see I'm only keeping this on the outer corner of
3:07the eye
3:08I'm not going to bring this all the way into the inner corner otherwise we're
3:10gonna start to look very 60s which is super cool but not what i'm going for in
3:14this specific look so I'm keeping it on the outer corner and I want the main
3:17darkness to be right on the outer edge of my eye and kind of faded up as we go
3:23then I'll go back with that 433 brush and just make sure it's blended out
3:26I was just going back in with a little bit of kid or cement one of those light
3:30shades on your brush just a little bit just to blend that out so that nothing
3:33is harsh again avoiding the actual lid area
3:36strictly staying on the upper crease once i blended that I realize I want to
3:40just a touch more of the anastacio so I went back in which is a little bit more
3:44of deep brown now we're going to go on with this makeup forever palette
3:47this is a new palette a sephora i love these shadows they are so pigmented so
3:53beautiful and I wanted to go in with this really bright white
3:57if you don't have this palette i would suggest something like mac crystal
4:00avalanche or like mac vanilla pigment you could even just using the next like
4:04jumbo white pencil but i really love the shadows and I had the palate sitting in
4:08front of me so I wanted to use them and as you can see they are pigmented as
4:11heck this is not using a wet brush or anything this is just the color payoff
4:16which is so amazing so I am using a mac 242 to apply that which is just a
4:21flattop synthetic hair brush and that will any flat synthetic brush will apply
4:26it like shimmers the best and now we're gonna be going in with mac platinum
4:30pigment
4:30this is my favorite silver of all time it is a true
4:34true silver platinum and I'm going to put this on the middle of the eye and
4:37the outer area of the I i really wanted to be kind of on break the inner corners
4:41stock white and a face like a platinum silver
4:44so using that same 242 I'm going to begin to press down on the outer corner
4:47of the eye and I'm going to actually going to use it to clean up that cut
4:50crease so if you were messy at all you have any fall on your lid this is your
4:53time to really kind of carpet and go back and forth to make it nice and sharp
4:57again i'm taking a little bit more of the Anasazi a deep brown and that same
5:01more feet 507 brush I'm going to put a little bit more just to make sure that
5:05it's nice and sharp but yet still blended that make sense to shop and
5:09whether you got me you're keeping up
5:11so now we're going in with mac pro emphasize this is a highlighting powder
5:15and i'm going to just put that in the inner corner of the eye to really
5:17highlight
5:18I'm going to dabble a little bit over that inner corner highlight that we have
5:21going on
5:22I'm going to bring it all the way up so it's kind of going towards the brow area
5:26to make everything nice and soft and i'm going to bring it underneath the eye
5:28area
5:29about halfway and on that lower lash line
5:32I really wanted the inner corner of my eye to pop and look very icy so I was
5:36putting a lot of this all over that inner rim but I didn't want it to be too
5:40frosty that's why I didn't go in with like mac nylon I wanted to still have
5:44kind of a mat inner corner of the eye that's why i chose that now for my brows
5:49i am using the Anasazi railways as always i'm so excited for her new brow
5:53product to come out have you guys seen her pencil on her instagram i'm like
5:56dying i'm so excited to try it because im so diehard for the brows
6:00I love it so much so I can't wait anything that she developed for the
6:03brows
6:03I'm so fangirl about it's ridiculous
6:07now i'm going to go in the house of lashes boudoir eyelashes god I just love
6:12the name of these lashes they're just so fun to say i was going to pop those on
6:16the upper lash line as you see i did not apply any liner
6:20go ahead and apply some minor if you want you can do a wing you can do a
6:23smokey liner you can do just a straight line whatever you want but I don't want
6:26to apply any liner I wanted to keep this look nice and simple and i'm going to go
6:30back in with that same anastasi a deep brown again I'm gonna pop that on the
6:34lower lash line and I'm going to keep that strictly on the outer corner of my
6:38eye only I do not want to bring it in and start getting that lower lash line
6:42to smokey I want to really keep that highlight nice and bright
6:44on the inner corner and then using any pencil brush I'm is going to buff it out
6:49I did put a little bit of kid on my pencil brush that we have a lighter
6:52color to buff it out because it's hard to buff out of color not using a lighter
6:56one so since i put the dark one
6:57I pick up a little bit of a lighter shade and I buff it out so it's nice and
7:00blended and smoky only on the lower half of the eye
7:05you'll see after I do this step how much like my eyes are going to look open and
7:09make them pop and that's the point of this this look and these steps i'm
7:13applying is a vanilla liner it does not matter which one because what I'm going
7:16to do next is I'm going to go back with that exact same white that we use on the
7:20eyes
7:21the tiny little precision brush you can use a q-tip if you want i'm going to pop
7:24that right on top of my waterline and basically what we're going to do is it's
7:28going to keep that water line really bright the entire day
7:31it will also make it so that it doesn't bleed it doesn't move it doesn't fade
7:35and it's also going to make your eyes pop way more if you just have a stark
7:39white eyeliner you can use that but i did not have that I ran out
7:43I don't know where it went i haven't had it in years so this is what I did
7:48setting your liner with powder and your waterline is a really great way to make
7:52it last the entire day doe
7:53so if you guys have issues with it moving and running so now for bronzer
7:57i'm going to be using the hourglass luminous bronzer light my sister is the
8:00one that introduced this bronzer to me and it is so beautiful so i would highly
8:04suggest it for those of you who are very fair out there because my sister is very
8:07very light like milky colored skin and it looks gorgeous on her
8:10I'm not going to lie i am very flustered by how they showed up on camera it looks
8:14blotchy it
8:15it just doesn't look good it's causing me stress but we're going to move past
8:18that ok move past it
8:20for blush I'm going to be going in with the bomb our guile argyle is the name of
8:24the blush and it's just this beautiful matte babydoll pink
8:27the bomb has such great blushes and I think no one ever talks about them but
8:30they're so good there be honestly such a beautiful formulas i love them
8:35i'm going to go over that with you Bobby Brown shimmer brick in the shade
8:38pink and i'm going to put that right on the apples of the cheeks because i
8:41personally would have gone in with a light babydoll pink lip which is what I
8:45exchange it for after I got done filming and pink cheeks but i wanted to do
8:48something different because I know a lot of you guys have really been in
8:51- these kind of dark purple emami brown shades recently but i really love a pink
8:56lip with this look
8:57side note for the highlight I'm using champagne pop and pearl pearl is now
9:01permanent buyback us if you're interested in that you can purchase it
9:03separately
9:04it is not just in this palette anymore they just release it which is super
9:07exciting that such a beautiful unique really really light highlight for those
9:12of you who are super fair
9:13i'm also going to highlight my Cupid's bow then i'm going to set my face using
9:16the Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray and I want to do this first before
9:20I apply these little gems on the inner corner of my eyes that way at the Urban
9:24Decay makeup spray didn't like wet in them and make them move or slide around
9:27from the wetness of the spray
9:29so I'm going to use one of these little rhinestones is a pack of like I don't
9:32know a thousand of these little rhinestones I got it from amazon it was
9:35like 299 for this pack using tweezers I'm literally just going to pop it on
9:39the inner corner of my eye it's so easy and if they don't have an adhesive on
9:42the back just put a dot eyelash glue on it wait 20 seconds and pop it on and
9:46you're good to go so easy you can put these all of your lid to which will look
9:49gorgeous for the lips i'm going to use color pop stingray

2:16tutorial lost my train of a lot of makeup tutorial on the look that i have
2:19on right here
2:20i asked you guys on Twitter if you want to see something dramatic or more
2:23natural or neutral and ninety-five percent of you guys that a dramatic
2:28drama all caps with explanations and I was like oh my god
2:32so you guys asked for it heroes I wanted to do something cool tone because you
2:37know i love my warm tones and I I feel like I'm not as intense my warm tones
2:42here my channel I used to be though I definitely transition more like neutral

2:50like a brick red wrapped around my eyes every day with like 3d mean clashes like

3:03smoky eye
3:05I've never done a look like this before I have been a silver and black tutorial
3:08but what's different about this is there's no liner
3:11there's no intense wing there's no sharp edge this is so rounded and blown out it
3:16literally looks like smoke on the eye which is just like my favorite look of
3:21all time I absolutely love it

3:40soon bye guys
3:41oh my god towards you and Frank you're legit colleague right now mama can't
3:46take it
3:47hello my love's so today we are going to be starting with our skin so i am going
3:53to go in with a primer i'm using makeup forever
3:56radiant primer and i'm going to massage this all over the skin
3:59you know the drill with primer let's move past that i'm also going to be
4:03using a new product i have not used on camera before and this is by the brand
4:06Tata and thus a luminous dewy skin miss i bought this solely because of the fact
4:10that Kim Kardashian uses it and I wanted
4:12glow so I've been trying it out and i love it i will talk more about it and an
4:16upcoming video though so just hang tight i'm going in with the LC micro silk
4:21foundation absolutely love this foundation I've been raving about it now
4:24for quite a few videos and it is like my non-stop go to i am applying that using
4:28a foundation brush by more feet this is the e 31
4:31this is from the Elite Collection which is amazeballz now I'm going to conceal
4:35my under eye area
4:37I skip this part pretty quickly because I feel like you guys have seen me do
4:39this whole entire drill five thousand times and if you ever want updated
4:43foundation or concealer routine you know just to ask and I shall give it to you
4:47so i am just going ahead and using a damp beauty blender to blend out the
4:51Urban Decay waitlist naked concealer up towards the temple then I always take it
4:56and I put it on my chin around my nose because women can always get red there
5:00that's just due to hormones
5:01you can't escape it and then in the center of the forehead as well just to
5:05even out that very light highlight that we're doing and then also just to make
5:08things look a little bit more natural when you do consider aren't the eyes and
5:12even out other place to the face
5:14in the end it will just make everything look a little bit more put together now
5:17i'm going to set that highlight using my two favorite under I highlighting
5:21powders
5:22I am mixing both mac pro emphasize which is a pro product but you can still find
5:25out on mac cosmetics calm and anastacio banana powder which you can find
5:30separately or it comes in her contour kit the original one as well so i'm
5:34going to set the entire under eye area and also the eyelid because that will
5:37help prep our eyes for eyeshadow also the chin and the center of the forehead
5:41so that nothing moves or creases in it last all day long
5:44now we're going to go in with the eyes i'm going to be using the Kat Von D
5:48shade light eye palette can we please just admire this palette oh my god
5:52we're starting off with that matte grey shade which by the way this entire
5:55palette is Matt which is just amazing i love it when people do all mats or all
5:59summer palace I just think it's so fun
6:01so going on with that gray shade in the sigma e40 i'm going to only put this on
6:05the outer corner of the eye as you can see i'm going to do something that's
6:08gonna make a lot of people nervous and that isn't going to wrap this color
6:11completely around the eye as you can see i'm not separating the shades going in
6:16now with makeup geek barcelona beach
6:18this is not completely necessary but i love this color and just adding more
6:22and more graze on top of grey's is just going to give such a three-dimensional
6:26look and in the end it's just gonna look so smoky and so blown out i feel like
6:30the more colors i use the more seamless my eyes look so I am now using a more
6:34fee and 503 blending brush and again i'm going to put that mainly in the outer
6:38corner of the eye all over that lid area
6:40I'm going to wrap it around you really want to halo and circle that entire I I
6:45know it can be intimidating to do this because you're like wait a second i'm
6:48about to have a black eye
6:49but just do it and I'm telling you the end result is so beautiful so using this
6:53kind of like chocolatey gray color it's really interesting because its color
6:57isn't like a deep gray but it's also not a deep brown it's like a chocolaty great
7:00and it's beautiful
7:01i'm going to be using an e 22 brush my morphe and i'm going to again
7:05pack this on that outer corner I love this brush because it has a little bit
7:08of a tip
7:09so you can really get precise with it which is why I'm going on with this
7:12blending brush right now
7:13once you are done with that you're going to want to go in with a fluffy brush
7:16like the sigma e40 and just go back and forth and blend blend blend that is
7:21what's going to make this look beautiful and not look like you got punched in the
7:23face is blending so be patient and take your time i'm going in with laura
7:27mercier translucent powder and I'm going to pack that on my cheekbones come about
7:31to go in with a very intense black and I just do that that way it will catch the
7:34fall out and not get all over my face Andrew my foundation
7:37so now going in with that black from the palette and a sigma e25 I'm not just
7:41going to begin to do the same thing with this that I do with those other shades
7:44and yes Frankie was whining at my feet that's why I'm holding him here for a
7:47quick second but I'm about to put him down
7:49so I'm going to pack that on the entire outer corner but i'm also going to make
7:53sure that i am not going above my crease we're going to keep this a little bit
7:57lower than the gray colors because we don't want to go extended too high
8:01otherwise once again that can kind of make you look like a panda bear and kind
8:05of like you've been bruised
8:06the trick is to keep the black as low as possible and that the grades go up
8:09higher so keep the black low and make sure that you blend blend blend and
8:14those two things combined are going to make it so it's your smoky eye is
8:17beautiful and not too scary and not too harsh and jagged where it can look like
8:21whoa what did you do to your face because you know exactly I'm talking
8:24about
8:24we've all had that problem smokey eyes before so again with the black i'm
8:27wrapping it around the eye and again blending it out just make sure that you
8:32really take your time
8:33talk on this black very intensely and halo around the entire corner of your
8:37eye to really make it blown out and smoky
8:40now I'm going to line my waterline using using ardency Inn eyeliner
8:44this is the creamiest kinkiest blackest liner i've ever used and it does not
8:47leave my waterline all day long
8:50i'm using the e 18 pencil brush from the elite collection and all that causes
8:54pencil brush is amazing just to pack on a little bit more black
8:58now i'm going with a mac - 28 brush and this is the teeth tiniest little
9:01precision brush you've ever seen and i use this to highlight my inner corner
9:05i am currently using math shroom eyeshadow I'm sorry I didn't show you
9:08the camera show the camera the product but I was just so my zone you know how
9:12it is
9:13I'm going to pack that on really intensely on the inner corner of my eye
9:16cause I wanted to be a very very bright in our corner I mean you can go is
9:20bright white as you want and I don't think it's really going to be 2 over
9:22boards it really works since you have such a dark outer corner have a really
9:26intense bright inner corner that exact same shroom color by mac i'm going to
9:31use that all my brow bone just to highlight this to me is so necessary
9:34when you're doing like an intense smoky eye
9:37highlighting the brow bone is just going to complete that bombshell look
9:41now i'm going in with a mac pressed pigment you guys know I'm such a fan of
9:44mac press pigments I think they're gorgeous
9:46when im using the shade in lightning and i'm going to just pack that on the lid
9:49using my finger you can choose to use glitter glue it will make this easier i
9:53am using a paper towel so I don't get too much fallout because you will have
9:57fallout with the mat press pigments you really can't escape it when you're
10:01applying it unless you use glitter glue
10:02I'm gonna pop on some false lashes these are by it flutters eyelashes i'm not
10:06sure what Sally are you guys I'm so sorry i've used them like 15 times it's
10:10just like one of those things they've been sitting on my vanity I keep popping
10:12them on sanitary I know
10:14moving on now i'm going to contour my face i am using the NARS either brush
10:19I've been obsessed with this again you guys my tried-and-true died was so
10:22obsessed with his back in the day and it is back in business and i'm going to
10:25just cut my face using the too faced chocolate soleil bronzer and then I'm
10:30just of course going to even that out by bronzing my forehead as well I'm going
10:34to go in with becca sweet pea blush using a more feet e3 is this notice it
10:39before I'm sorry sweet P blushes my go-to blush and I'm doing smokey eyes
10:43because it gives just enough color to the skin but it's very neutral and it's
10:46not over
10:46the top on the cheeks now to highlight i'm going to use mary-lou manizer by the
10:51bomb
10:51it's such a beautiful neutral very vanilla shade i love love love this
10:55highlight when I'm not doing something to bronzy because it's so vanilla it
