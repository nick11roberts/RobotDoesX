0:05hey guys so today's video is another Valentine's Day tutorial I said that I
0:20would be posting like two more this is the second look I came up with and i'm
0:25using the very obvious naked 3 palette i know there's tons of Valentine's Day
0:30tutorials with this palette but a bunch of you requested that I do a Valentine's
0:33they look with the palette so that's what I did and this is what i came up
0:38with I only used one other eye shadow that wasn't in this palette but it's a
0:43purple and you can find her body we're actually really like this look because
0:48it is really really simple it's a nice light pink blush like pink lips and like
0:53a pinky purple
0:54I and I just think it's nice and sweet and soft and romantic
1:00so for those of you who like that soft and romantic look this one is perfect
1:05for you
1:05so let me know down below if you like this to run if you want to see how to
1:08get this look then just keep on you
1:11I'm going to start by priming my eyelids with Too Faced shadow insurance then I'm
1:18going to take the color limit and the naked 3 palette and this is going to be
1:20my transition color and taking it on a fluffy brush and I'm just probably going
1:25to put this all over my crease some of my eye as well
1:31then I'm taking the color buzz in the palette and i am going to apply this all
1:36over my lid with a flat shader brush the pigmentation on this eyeshadow isn't the
1:44best as you can probably tell so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a
1:48little bit of a fix plus and spray that on my brush and then give it back into
1:52the eyeshadow and apply it like that
2:00yeah
2:01then I'm going to take nooner and on my - 17 I'm just gonna quickly blend the
2:07harsh edge of that eye shadow
2:13now i'm going to take my wet and wild last palette this is the other i'm sure
2:20i'm using for this tutorial but you can use any matte purple
2:24this is a duper max fake one if you have the eyeshadow then use that one but I'm
2:29just going to take my mac 217 and i'm going to start applying this eyeshadow
2:33on the outer view of my eye and then drag it up into the crease
2:41yeah
2:47now i'm going to take limit which is the first shadow we used and do the exact
2:52same thing i'm going to just blend this into my crease so that everything blends
2:57nicely
3:01and really quickly i'm just going to tight line and line my waterline with
3:04the Maybelline master drama eyeliner I'm going to take this bottle angled brush
3:10from hell and i'm going to dip it into max carbon and i'm going to start
3:13creating a line and I didn't want to use gel or liquid liner because I didn't
3:18want it to be too harsh I wanted to be really really soft
3:26next I'm taking black heart from the palette and I'm going to start stamping
3:31this on the outer V of my eye and then dragging it in so it fades nicely
3:37I just want to add a little bit of definition to the outer wheel my eye
3:45yeah
3:51yeah
3:55yeah
3:57yeah
3:59for my highlight am taking strange and i'm applying this underneath my problem
4:03and in my energy .
4:11I'm gonna go back into that buzz color with some more fix+ and apply it right
4:15in the center of my lid to give it that metallic pop
4:24then I'm just going to add some mascara and i'm going to move on to the rest of
4:28my face
4:29I already put my foundation and concealer on just to save some time but
4:32I'll listed down below what i used also i forgot to record it but I added some
4:38eye shadow to the lower lash line i added nooner from the palette
4:41I just smudge that underneath my lashes and then I added some mascara for my
4:46bronzer i am using the NYC bronzer in long talk bronze and I wanted my face to
4:51be very very simple
4:53which is why I didn't contour or anything like that
4:58I'm just rounding on my face a little bit for my blush i am using the l'oreal
5:05true match
5:06blush in baby blossom it's a light baby pink it's really pretty
5:10so I'm taking on my it cosmetics blush brush and I am just applying a very very
5:15subtle amount to my cheeks and then the sun went away but i am using my becca
5:22highlight in moonstone to highlight my cheekbones
5:30i am using the revlon pink pout super lustrous lipstick
5:39and then I am topping it off with the buxom lip gloss in White Russian
5:48yeah

1:11like this with the naked palette but it was so highly requested that I decided
1:15to go ahead and film it

0:19hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on juno gambler
0:26wow this is using at the urban decay naked smoky palette or Medicaid was nice
0:33enough to send it to me before it was released and I am pretty sure
0:37today i'm posting this on the day that you can buy this
0:42so it should be already available to purchase on urban decay . com I know
0:46that on an altar . comic comes out in a few days but you can buy at Urban Decay
0:51today
0:52this video is not sponsored by the way i'm just posting it on the day it's
0:56gonna be released really quick let me just give you like a mini review i love
1:00it i love the packaging
1:01I love the packaging still to this day my favorite packaging is the original
1:05naked palette I know that everybody hates that packaging but I love it and I
1:09despise the packaging on the Naked 2 m3 and then when this one came out I was so
1:14excited because it's like a magnet
1:16it's not like a 10 that closes so I'm so glad that they change the packaging and
1:20honestly when I saw this for the first time I was like wow this is exactly what
1:25i wanted the naked2 to be
1:27I love the first one it's my it's 14 pallets of all time and the third one is
1:31beautiful it's nice and rosy and then this one is what i wanted the second one
1:34to be like a smoky version I'm so happy they came out with this i think it's
1:38worth it even if you have the first one because it's different it's deeper it's
1:42more cool tone it's just start it smoky but this is the look i came up with I
1:46really love it for like a night out clubbing or something i really like it
1:51so if you want to get this local then just keep watching
1:55ok so the first thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids with Jessie's Girl
1:59eyeshadow primer I've been really liking this lately
2:02then I'm going to take the eyeshadow called combust
2:05this color is really close to my skin tone only a little bit more pinky
2:09so I'm just using this to set the eyeshadow primer because that primer is
2:12a little tacky
2:14I'm going into this white ish shade which i think is called 13 and i'm using
2:19this underneath my brow bone to really highlight and lift the brow and in my
2:24inner corners even though i'm going in with a different color later i'm going
2:28to take this
2:29milani milani milani shadow eyes and black and i'm using this as a base
2:35so I'm applying this to my entire lid and then I'm gonna kind of like you know
2:39move it around and try to blend it with just a regular eyeshadow brush
2:45I'm sick by the way my sound at that's why I'm gonna take this eyeshadow called
2:50armor
2:51I love this color because it has a ton of glitter but the glitter actually
2:56shows up like it's pigment enough to wear it it shows up I don't know it's
3:01really really really pretty
3:03i'm applying this to my entire lid i just love how it looks with a black base
3:07underneath that makes it deeper and I'm taking password
3:16i'm going to start blending this into my crease because we put a black bass down
3:20like a harsh line kind of created on my so I'm just going back and forth with
3:25the eyeshadow password taking my time and really trying to blend those two
3:30eyeshadows together it's going to take some time but you just have to double
3:33and 11
3:34I'm going right back into combust with a fluffy brush with no product with like
3:42no previous product just come bus and I'm blending everything taking the
3:47purple in the palace
3:48it's a good dark dark purple I think it's called remember but i'm just using
3:54this on the outer V of my eye it doesn't give too much step but just enough like
3:59I just want the outer corners to be just a little bit deeper and I'm dragging
4:03some of that into the crease just to help blend some more
4:06I decided this look would look really pretty with a wing a big wing a Smalling
4:11it doesn't really matter but i'm just adding a small little wing
4:14I want the eyeshadows to really stand out so I don't want to go too heavy with
4:17my wing
4:18now i'm just applying a ton of roller lash mascara to my bottom lashes and
4:23i'll finish the rest of my eyes when i'm done with my face
4:26ok so i decided to use this for the first time this is from lush cosmetics
4:29and it's called the skin tint feeling feeling younger skin tint gives your
4:35face like such luminosity
4:37it's very similar to the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer so yeah I put that on my
4:42face is like a nice moisturizing luminizing stuff then i went in with the
4:46LC foundation and I am in the shade sand
4:50I believe
4:51so yeah that's what I'm going on my face
4:55I actually really like this formation it is matt and it can be a little heavy but
4:59with a light layer
5:01it's actually really really pretty and it looks nice and Matt and really pretty
5:06I like it I dig it now i'm taking the urban decay naked skin concealer and the
5:11maybelline fit me concealer mixing both of them together just to get like a
5:16perfect color and then i will be blending that out as a huge
5:21i'm also highlighting with the fit me
5:28with my of course trustee to release - 17
5:32I feel like I talk about this all the time but i love it was sent to me by a
5:35subscriber not even by the companies and don't always has no idea who the heck I
5:39am but thank you so much because they freakin look
5:41now i'm going to set that with a the wave a brush and I'm dipping the brush
5:46into the Kat Von D shade and light palette and I'm using the yellow shade
5:50to set my concealer and I'm gonna finish off the eyes I'm using the next check
5:59Charlie I can say black gel eyeliner and then i'm going to go in with slate
6:06I've no password this is password and with a pencil brush
6:09I am rubbing that in my lower lash line to smoke out the black eyeliner and then
6:13I wanted it to be just a little darker
6:15so I'm taking that color right there and just further some no get out
6:22i'm applying some roller lash mascara to my bottom lashes and minimal problems
6:28and policies and the falls i use or the posh with lashes and i'm going to go
6:33into hi this is the first pallet
6:36I mean the first shadow on the palate and actually what the eyeshadow with a
6:39little bit fix+ so it can be super intense and that's what I applied to my
6:44inner corners now I'm just going to contour using the Kat Von D shade light
6:48palette i'm using the more cool tone color and an angled brush to add some
6:52content to my cheekbones like my voice is going away so like I'm going to go
6:58cold
6:59this sucks now i'm going to take the warmer shade in the palette because when
7:04I have a tan too much in
7:06I don't like my contour to be too ashy I'm just adding a little bit of warmth
7:11the blush I'm using is tarts captivating
7:28then for highlight I'm using this to analyse duo
7:34so don't lace what the heck the Sonia Kashuk duo that has like a bronze and
7:38highlights i'm using the pinky highlight from a highly it's super intense and
7:42super beautiful i highly recommend this you can get at target then I'm going to
7:46take the Loreal lalak lippy thingy and charcoal black and I'm applying this to
7:53my entire lips
7:55this is already glossy it's like a lacquer finish but i wanted to add some
7:59more gossip I'm taking the show for a perfect nude lip gloss and i'm applying
8:04that on top so that completes this look I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
8:09you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
8:12will see you in my next video bye
0:27hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial this is the look I was wearing
0:34in my only unboxing and a bunch of you guys said you wanted a tutorial on it i
0:38didn't use the cosmetics naturally pretty palette to achieve this look but
0:43honestly i only use two eyeshadows in the entire pallet this look is mainly
0:46focused around really thick eyeliner and really big voluminous fake lashes so
0:52basically anybody can achieve this look as long as you have eyeliner and fake
0:56lashes you're good to go as long as you use two colors that are similar to the
1:00ones that I used in this tutorial this tutorial was kind of an epic fail this
1:04eyeliner came out super wonky and it was just so frustrating and I wasn't going
1:10to take off all my makeup just put it back on so I mean it looks a little
1:15wonky forgive me but yeah I really want to get back into filming makeup
1:19tutorials more often used to do them all the time but i'm going to get back into
1:23filming a lot more for you guys so leave a comment down below if there's a
1:26palette i have that you want to tour on or anything like that and i will film
1:30those for you if you want to see how to get this really thick eyeliner thick
1:35lashes look what is this i don't know just keep watching
1:39so I'm going to do things a little bit different in this video I'm starting off
1:43with my face that usually start off with my eyes but I am taking the Baum's
1:47tinted moisturizer called bomb shelter and i'm going to be using my makeup geek
1:52foundation stippling brush to apply it
1:56this tinted moisturizer is a little bit weird when I first apply you don't
2:00really see much color coming off but as they both fit into my skin it oxidizes
2:04which is ok for me because it oxidizes immediately and it matches my neck and
2:10the rest of my body so good and I'm speeding through this clip because it
2:15would take way too long for you to sit there and see the whole process I put
2:18two layers on my face just to get more coverage and it sent invoice riser so it
2:22doesn't get kinky at all i love this tinted moisturizer love the finish it's
2:26my fav next I'm gonna take my booboo cover up concealer and I'm going to be
2:31applying this underneath my eyes in a triangle shape just to highlight and
2:36cover up my dark circles of course

3:24eyelids
3:29yeah
3:37and then because i have a lot of veins on my eyes I'm just gonna take that same
3:40boo cover up concealer and add this to my whole eyelid just so it's a nice even
3:45canvas and there are no veins poking through or anything like that
3:51yeah
3:55next I'm taking my mac emphasize powder and with my Real Techniques contour
4:00brush i'm just going to set the concealer
4:06and i'm also going to bring this onto my eyelids because this Potter has a really
4:09pretty rude essence to it
4:11I don't know how to explain it just looks really really nice and glowy so I
4:15like to bring it on my eyelids as well especially for this look I just think it
4:18looks nice now i'm taking my it cosmetics naturally pretty palette and
4:24I'm gonna take this shade right here called transforming pearl and i'm going
4:27to use this to highlight underneath my brow bone
4:34next I'm taking this shade called mocha and i'm going to take my mac 217 and
4:40start adding this to the outer V of my eye and then slowly bring it into the
4:44crease
4:48I just go back and forth with this eyeshadow adding a little by little
4:56yeah
5:00i'm also creating like a triangle with the same eyeshadow just flicking my
5:04brush outwards like that so it looks like a nice little sharp triangle shape
5:09on the outer beef if you know what I'm saying hey I just go back and forth with
5:14the eyeshadow and build it up a little by little
5:16now i'm going to take this transforming pearl shade again and I'm going to add
5:20some to the inner parts of my eye just to make it look nice and glowy and then
5:24this is gonna be my inner corner highlight as well now i'm going to line
5:28my tight line and my waterline with Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
5:32midnight master and then I'm going to be adding some falsies with this look these
5:38are from house of lashes and they're in the style called true romance and I
5:43cannot put on false lashes on camera to save my life it takes forever so i just
5:48did that off-camera and now i'm taking my Maybelline line stiletto liquid liner
5:53and i'm just adding a really really thick eyeliner on top i'm going to go
5:59back into that palette and take the shade mocha and i'm just going to deepen
6:03out my crease with this and my outer V just a little bit more
6:11and I'm gonna take that same eyeshadow and run it underneath my lashes just to
6:14smoke it out a little bit and then I'm going to add mascara moving on to the
6:18rest of my face i am taking my bahama mama bronzer by the bomb and i'm going
6:23to be using a sigma highlighting brush just to contour my face

7:12the shade musk and i'm going to apply this to my lips
7:18and then I'm going to add my NYX butter gloss in fortune cookie right on top

7:26them a little bit lighter and that is the finished look I hope you guys
7:31enjoyed thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't
7:34already and I will see you in my next video
0:17so i found a tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right now it is using the Urban
0:25Decay Naked 2 palette and I really wanted to film this kind of tutorial
0:29because i usually wear like browns and golds
0:34as opposed to blacks and sellers so I kind of wanted to branch out and do
0:38something different and I rarely use my naked 2 palette since it's a little bit
0:43more cool tone so I wanted to bring this puppy out and do something for the cool
0:48tone lovers out there and I'm actually really liking how it turned out I don't
0:53know I just I really really love it if you want to see how I got this look then
0:56just keep on watching
0:57ok so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to prime my eyelids with Mac's
1:04painterly Paint Pot
1:09for that really sharp cat eye look like they're really sharp edges
1:13I'm going to take some tape and put it on the back of my hand a few times just
1:17so that it doesn't pull at the skin around my eyes
1:26now i'm going in with Urban Decay's Naked 2 palette and I'm going to be
1:32taking the color tease
1:36and with the sigma e40 i am going to work that into my crease
1:41I'm just going to be using this as a transition color so all the other colors
1:45blend nicely
1:56next I'm going in with the color pistol which is this color right here and I'm
2:01taking it on a mac 239 brush and I'm going to pack this color on my entire
2:08lid
2:21ok
2:30ok so because i want this color to really stand out
2:34I'm going to take max fix+ and spray that on my brush and adding 6 plus to
2:41any eyeshadow really intensifies the color a lot so I'm just going to pack
2:46this on my lid again
2:59yeah
3:00so you can really see what a difference the fixed plus makes on the eye shadow
3:09yeah
3:12now i'm going in with the color black out and i'm just going to work this on
3:17the outer part of my eye and a little bit in the crease
3:21this part takes a lot of time it's just really going back and forth with that
3:25same color and just working it in lightly because blackout is a very very
3:30pigmented black eyeshadow
3:32so going back in forth and adding that shadow little by little kind of helps
3:36you blend it out a lot more as opposed to just dipping your brush into the eye
3:41shadow and putting it on your I are gonna have like a big black spot because
3:44it's so pigmented so just take your time with it and go back and forth and just
3:48work it into the crease and into the outer corners as well
4:20ok now I'm going to take this brush right here it's from coastal sense
4:23it's just an eyeshadow brush but it's really soft so I like using it for this
4:27and i'm just going to be dipping it back into that same blackout color and really
4:32packing on the color on the outer corners and blending it towards the
4:37center of my eye
4:38so this part is just really a lot a lot of blending you just want to take the
4:43color and mostly focusing on the outer part of your I like where the tape meets
4:48the eye shadow and just blend it towards the center
4:54like I said it's just a lot of blending just pack the color out on the outer
4:58corner and start blending it in
5:04this part is completely up to you if you want it really really intense black on
5:08the outer corners or if you don't want it so intense so whatever is comfortable
5:13for you
5:25yeah
5:27ok
5:33now i'm taking the color foxy and i'm adding this as my highlight under my
5:39brow bone
5:46this color fox is pretty much the color of my skin
5:50so I'm going to be taking a little bit of booty call it took very shimmery so
5:54I'm only taking a little bit of it and adding it to like the high . underneath
5:59my eyebrow like underneath the arch
6:05now i'm taking my favorite eyeliner it is the Maybelline master drama eyeliner
6:14and i'm going to tight line with this and also be adding this to my waterline
6:25ok now for the liquid liner i'm using my Maybelline mine stiletto and just adding
6:33some liquid liner
6:51ok I really want the liquid liner to be as mad as possible and the lines the
6:56little can kind of leave it a little bit glossy
6:58so I'm going to take black out and just kind of set the liquid liner with the
7:02black eyeshadow and it makes it look very matte which is what I want
7:09now i'm just taking off the tape and you have this perfectly straight sharp cat I
7:14kind of look I love it and I'm just taking my little makeup remover and kind
7:21of like cleaning around any fallout yada yada
7:24you know you know
7:32ok and here i'm just doing the face makeup
7:35I didn't really go into detail with this I i always do
7:39so I wanted to keep it short for this video but of course i will be listing
7:42all the things i used on my face on in the description box but i'm just using
7:48some foundation and concealer not stuff
7:51I just really wanted to my foundation on before I finished my eyes because i am
7:55not done with my makeup
7:57if you're wondering see back to the ice ok i added two more eyeliner by the way
8:02because i felt like it had kind of faded
8:04ok so anyway I'm taking the brush that came with the naked 2 palette and I'm
8:09taking the color verb which is a very light shimmery silver and I'm going to
8:14pack this on the inner part of my eye so I want my I to go from like a light
8:19silver to a dark silver to black so I am packing on the inner part of my eye and
8:24I'm also putting this in my to deck area as my highlight
8:44yeah
8:50ok so now i'm taking a pencil brush and I'm doing it in to that same verb color
8:55and I'm going to put this all over my lower lash line
8:59I personally think it looks nice and kind of brightens up the lower lash line
9:03even though i have like really intense black eyeliner
9:06I don't know I just think you kind of brightens up the look a little bit and i
9:10personally think it looks nice
9:14but I mean if you want to go darker on the lower lash line you totally can and
9:18it would still look really really nice
9:20it is up to you
9:23so now i'm just going to take my clinic clash doubling mascara and add mascara
9:27to my top and bottom lashes
9:32and voila
9:37these are the finished eyes
9:43ok so i already did the rest of my face makeup just ate some time I don't want
9:48this video to be too long but I contoured with my ELF contouring blush
9:56and bronzing powder thing just concert with the bronzer and for my blush i use
10:03the NYX blush and mom
10:06i have been loving this you guys know that if you saw my favorites video it's
10:09just like my favorite blush with the moment and I highlighted with an
10:15eyeshadow in my ceiling in the light palette i highlighted with kin
10:21just like that highlight I have going on here i have been loving to highlight my
10:26cheeks with this kid eyeshadow it's beautiful
10:30yeah hello anyway I still need to put on some lipstick
10:34I'm first going to take people glam gaga from Mac - all busted and gross
10:41so I'm going to take it on well the first like this
10:49I'm putting it on very very lightly I don't want it to be like bubblegum pink
10:52just like a light wash of a baby pink color
11:01and then on top of that i am taking my NYX butter gloss and creme brulee
11:05I have been obsessed with this it's beautiful so that's what I'm going to
11:09layer on top
11:17ok guys so that is the finished look I really hope you like this tutorial and I
11:22hope you try it out on yourself
11:23thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already
11:27and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys todays video is a one brand tutorial on this look right here
0:07my last one brand tutorial was a full face elf makeup look
0:12and I got pretty positive feedback so i want to do these more often so today i
0:16am using all make up for ever
0:18products my next one brand tutorial will be drug store so I want to do like one
0:23drug store one high end and then alternate them back and forth so today
0:27at high-end since my last one was drug store and if you want to see how to get
0:30this look then just keep on watching
0:33I'm going to start by priming my face with the step 1 equalizer this is the
0:37hydrating one this one is probably my favorite one just because i do have dry
0:41skin and i love how it fits underneath my makeup then I'm going to take my holy
0:46grail foundation
0:47not just because it's Make Up For Ever it's literally my favorite foundation
0:51you guys know this if you saw my foundation video
0:54this is the face and body foundation it's waterproof at last such a long time
0:59it's a very sheer coverage but I find that it does even out my skin tone and
1:03because the coverage is kind of sheer i do have to build it up and work with it
1:06so that's why I'm fast-forwarding this part because if not we will be here for
1:10a good two minutes but i'm just applying that with a flat top student at least
1:14brush and now i'm making this face because when I wanted to film this video
1:19I realized it didn't have a concealer by make up for ever's I ran to the store
1:24and i purchased one on sephora this is the waterproof full-coverage concealer i
1:29have mine in the shade number four
1:31honestly this stuff is amazing but I think it would be better for blemishes
1:36because for underneath the eyes even though it has great coverage
1:39it's a little tacky and it's a little thick so it does crease
1:43I mean it worked perfectly fine for me and it lasted for the rest of the day
1:47but you do have to set it immediately because if not it will create because of
1:52the
1:52Agnes but hey I can't complain i'm like it
1:55so because i don't have a make up for ever setting powder
1:58I am just get a little creative here and i am using a artists eye shadow in the
2:03shape and 500 which is like a vanilla creamy matte shade so it's set my
2:08concealer perfectly
2:15by the way i also put that concealer on my eyelid to act as a primer so i
2:20decided to go ahead and do the rest of my face first I never do that but that's
2:24what i'm doing and i'm going to use this pro bronze fusion bronzer I believe
2:29that's what it's called
2:30and i'm pretty sure this one is in the shape 20 mm it's my favorite one because
2:34it has the coolest undertone the other ones are a lot more warm the other ones
2:40are amazing too but this one is perfect for contouring so I am contouring my
2:46face using a morphe brush from their elite collection
2:50you do have to build these bronzers up but they apply perfectly it's not
2:55powdery at all
2:56it's one of the best bronzer formulations i have ever seen
3:00and then i decided i wanted a little bit more contoured - like that brush with a
3:04little bit too fat so I picked up with the makeup geek chiseled face brush it's
3:09one of our new brushes and it gives you that very chiseled contour look and feel
3:13in it
3:14I like this brush so far so for blush I'm using this cream brush cream brush
3:20while
3:20no cream at blush it's a vibrant but oh my gosh I cannot be today is a vibrant
3:26pink but i like it with this makeup look and it's not too intense
3:30i'm applying it with a real techniques setting brush
3:34I believe this is in the shade - 10 or 220 but i will have everything down
3:37below
3:39hey i'm just applying a very soft layer I don't want too much you know now
3:43taking the pro sculpting duo in 01 first time taking a stippling brush and
3:49applying it into the bronzer just to warm up my face a little bit because I
3:53didn't want to add just a little bit of warm you know since the bronzer was a
3:57little bit more on the cool side
3:58then I'm dipping myself for a fan brush into with the highlight shade which is
4:03the stoner of this little duo it's a nice frosty pinky pearly shading it
4:08really love it
4:10so that is my highlight and then I'm just gonna go ahead and jump into the
4:12eyes
4:13so I'm using all of the Makeup Forever artists eye shadows today and the first
4:17I should i am using is M 548 and i'm using this on a more feed crease brush
4:22to just apply into my crease you know the drill my transition shade and now my
4:27favorite
4:28it's probably I'm not gonna lie my favorite make up for ever eyeshadow ever
4:33it's such a pretty like eggplant purple and this one is m 9 28 and I'm applying
4:39this with an out brush on my entire I and i am working in sections like i'm
4:44applying it little by little because I wanted that full on color so I'm just
4:47packing it on and taking my time
4:49then on a smaller crease brush with like no additional product
4:53I'm just blending out any harsh lines that like the purple created
4:59then I want to take one of my other favorites from the artists eye shadow
5:04line and i believe it's called pinky brown on sephora but it's a really
5:09pretty piggy brown
5:11yes the numbering is M 500 and 600 yes m600 and i'm using this in my crease
5:18with a mac 217 just to blow it out and then I'm going right back into the
5:23purple and just intensifying it because once you start of blending other colors
5:28in the crease the lid shade kind of disappears a little bit
5:32so as you can see i'm going back and forth with those two colors just to
5:36intensify everything and then I'm taking that same vanilla shade i use to set my
5:40concealer and i'm using that as a brow bone highlight and then I'm taking
5:44something a little bit shimmery ER because everything is so mad I wanted
5:48the problem just have a little bit of shimmer and I used
5:51I for one for for that now in a pencil brush i'm applying this to my lower lash
5:56line and then I remembered oh I wanted to put eyeliner and i forgot to do that
6:00well this is a Make Up For Ever eyeliner in brown and i'm just applying that on
6:05my waterline and then I'm going right back to doing what I was doing earlier
6:09so this is like a more feed pencil brush and i just applied that purple all
6:13across my lower lash line then taking a bigger pencil brush and dipping into
6:18pinky brown and just look in that out
6:21so for liner i am using this graphic liner actually bought this with the
6:25Christian Grey or like 50 shades of grey collection i bought like during
6:28christmas and now is when I'm getting around to using it is so black
6:33so i just applied my typical like small little wing and then i'm going to load
6:38on the mascara this is the smoky lash mascara
6:41no smokey extravagant mascara and then i am using that same shade i used under my
6:48brow bone the I for one for just to intensify my inner corners so we are
6:55almost done but now to do the lips I'm taking this lip liner in the shade 1c
7:01and I am lining my lips and then filling in my lips as well and then I wanted
7:05something a little bit more on the cool side like I wanted a cool tones lips i'm
7:09using this aqua rouge it's a liquid lipstick basically and this one is in
7:13the shade number one it's like a super gray cool tone liquid lipstick so I only
7:19. in some in the center and then blend it out with my finger just to make it a
7:23cool to lip but not like super grade so that completes the slick I hope you guys
7:27enjoyed this video
7:28thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next
0:16hey guys so today's video is a tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing it is another
0:22naked 3 tutorial
0:23am i doing to any of these maybe but in my defense this was requested this is
0:29the look i am wearing in my previous video the very favorites video and a
0:34bunch of the guys said you wanted to see a tutorial on it
0:36so here I am what I like so much about this look is that it's literally so easy
0:42there's no wing no eyeliner
0:44nothing too dramatic it is a nice simple bronzy look and i love that because the
0:49naked 3 palette is full of nice rosy pinky color so you wouldn't think of
0:55doing a look so warm and chocolaty and bronzy but you can now obviously there
1:00are some rosy undertones and this look like you could definitely see the Pink's
1:04kind of popping through but that's because you know it's a prank palette
1:08but you've been wanting to do a nice bronzy look with the naked 3
1:12I hope you enjoyed this one so if you want to see how to get this look just
1:17keep watching
1:18ok so to prime my eyes I'm using the Urban Decay primer potion
1:23then I'm going to be taking the Milani shadow lies in the shade golden bronze
1:30and i'm going to use this as a base for the eyeshadows i'm using
1:35and then I'm just going to blend that out with my finger keeping it below my
1:40crease
1:48so I'm going to take my naked 3 palette and I'm going to go into the shade
1:51nooner
1:52and i'm going to use this in my crease with a mac 217
1:55just to blend out that base we just put down
2:05I'm going to build the color slowly and take it a little bit far past my crease
2:12then I'm going to go into the color trick and I'm going to use my mac fix+
2:17just intensify this eyeshadow a little bit more and then i'm going to apply
2:20this all over my lid right up to the crease
2:31the next color I'm using it this one called factory and i'm using this one
2:35because it does have a lot of brown to it so it's really going to complement
2:38that gold color and i'm just going to take this on my - 17 and slightly blend
2:43it into my crease while putting it on my outer V as well i'm also going to be
2:49taking a smaller flat shader brush this one's from coastal sense and i'm just
2:54gonna be packing that same color onto my outer V and then bringing it into my
2:58crease and i'm using this brush to just get a little bit more precise than the
3:02217
3:03going back into my - 17 with no additional product I'm just going to
3:07blend everything into my crease now with a tiny little brush I'm going to take
3:11the color black heart and i'm just going to add this really close to my lashes
3:14but on the outer V of my eye
3:17so right in the middle i'm just going to drag it all the way to the end and this
3:20is going to make like an imaginary eyeliner look but it's not going to be
3:24as harsh
3:25then I'm just going to highlight with the color strange and i'm going to use
3:28that under my brow bone and in my tear duct as well for my mascara i am using
3:33the jordana best lash extreme
3:36I'm gonna go on to the rest of my face before I finish up underneath my eyes
3:41so I'm going to prime my face with the law real miracle blur and i'm only going
3:45to add this to places where i think i need it
3:48I'm not going to put this all over my face and said it's pretty thick
3:53yeah
3:56the foundation I'm using is the revlon colorstay what foundation in 250 medium
4:01beige and I'm going to use my real techniques sponge to apply it
4:06this is a pretty thick foundation so I like using a sponge to apply it and
4:10bends it out and gives it a little bit more of a dewy finish
4:20then I'm going to take my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser
4:24and i'm going to highlight my face and cover my dark circles
4:30yeah
4:39then I'm going to take my Real Techniques contour blush to blend all
4:43that out

4:58to set that area underneath my eyes and using the fit me powder in 135 creamy
5:03natural
5:11underneath my eyes I'm going to take a tiny little brush and I'm going to dip
5:14it into the color factory and i'm just going to run this underneath my lashes
5:18I didn't use eyeliner or anything like that you can go ahead and do that if you
5:21want it to be a little bit more dramatic but i liked the way it looked without
5:24eyeliner and i'm going to take my little clinic bottom lash mascara and i'm going
5:30to apply this to my bottom lashes
5:34now i'm just going to bronze up my face a little bit and I'm going to use the
5:37NYC son and bronze in the shade Montauk bronze with my real techniques blush
5:41brush and I'm just gonna pretty much
5:43so this all over my face
5:55yeah
5:59for my blush i am using meet our amazonian clay blush in the color
6:03exposed with my it cosmetics blush brush

6:16bronzer intiki and i'm just going to highlight my cheekbones down the bridge
6:20of my nose and a little bit above my lip for lipstick
6:24i'm using this extremely white lipstick from Maybelline called bear at all
6:29no it's called bear all pretty sure yeah and it is way too white for me so I just
6:34like to dab a little bit on my lips to make them more nude to top it off i'm

6:41this makeup tutorial
6:42thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already
6:45and I will see you in my next one
0:17hey guys so today's video is another tutorial on these roles gold eyes it's
0:23very very fast and simple to daytime appropriate
0:27so the first thing I'm going to do is prime my eyelids and then I'm going to
0:30take the color limit and i'm going to buff this into my crease
0:37I'm going back and forth with this I really want this color to show up in my
0:40crease
0:41I have a cold like what I sound horrible
0:44now i'm taking this color here called trick and that is the really pretty
0:48rolls gold shade in the palette it's probably my dear I shadow but as you can
0:52see the pigmentation isn't the best so I'm just going to take some pics + wear
0:57that on my brush and then apply this to my lids and the fix plus really really
1:03intensify the eyeshadow and just makes it look like literally rose gold and it
1:07gives it like a nice Sheen to it
1:09i love how it looks with some fixed bless you can even use like I drop sir
1:13yeah then I'm taking the color nooner and then I'm just packing this on to my
1:18outer V and then I'm bringing this into the crease
1:25I want to be like nice and diffused and blown out that new new shade is so
1:29beautiful so I'm packing a lot of that into my crease then i'm taking the color
1:35factory and I'm going to put this underneath my lower lashes
1:40oh why my sig
1:44I hope I'm sorry that these are all voice overs but it's just I don't know
1:49then I'm going to take nooner that shade i used my crease and then blend out my
1:53lower lash line as well i'm thinking the lightest shade in the palette and this
1:57is going to be my brow bone highlight and my inner corner highlight then
2:01adding some morphic splash on my 6 plus on my brush I'm going to pack some of
2:06that trick color onto the inner part of my eye on the bottom lash line just to
2:10brighten it up a little bit then i'm just adding some mascara and that's
2:15pretty much it for the eyes and don't want to add eyeliner or winged liner
2:18anything like that since this is a daytime look
2:21and for my face I wanted to keep it very very very simple so honestly I just
2:26bronze my face a little bit using some physicians formula bronzer and that i
2:32didn't contour anything just warmed up my cheeks a little bit
2:38for my lips I'm using this Maybelline nude lipstick in blushing beige that I
2:42got recently and I swear it's like the most beautiful nude color in the world
2:46but i thought i was just like a little bit to New not to nude but i just wanted
2:51a little bit more pink
2:53so I took the Maybelline Color whisper and pedal rebel and I just add that on
2:58top just to give it a more pinky nude color and that's pretty much it
3:04like I said it was super quick thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see
3:07you in my next one bye
0:25ok so today's video is going to be a double tutorial i don't think i've ever
0:33done something like this but it's been so requested to continue to do tutorials
0:38using the Too Faced chocolate bar palette so i thought i would combine two
0:42in one
0:43this is the first look right here this would look really nice for spring it's
0:47just like a very dewy fresh look
0:50no liner no falsies it's something that's very very simple but it has like
0:56that pop of purple and it's just a little bit different than like a day to
0:59day look
1:00but it is perfect for daytime so if you want to see how to get look number one
1:04then just keep watching
1:05ok so i've already primed my eyelids and the first color I'm going in is with
1:09milk chocolate i'm using the beauty by Rosita brush and I'm just buffing this
1:14into my crease to create a nice little transition shade so all the colors can
1:18blend nicely on top
1:20I'm going into candied violet with a flat shader brush and I'm applying this
1:24to the outer corner of my eye and the inner corners of my i'm gonna leave the
1:28center of my lid blank because i'm going to go over it with another shadow
1:33by the way I'm losing my voice I don't know what it is yeah I don't know life
1:38I guess so i'm thinking candied violet like a very little amount of candy
1:43violet and I'm just buffing some of that into my crease so that it all flows
1:47together and I'm just intensifying you know that candied violets a moat
1:57now i'm going to go in with salted caramel i love this shadow it's probably
2:01my favorite in the palette and I'm just adding this to my crease to warm up the
2:06look a little bit and to just blend everything together now
2:12marzipan which is my other favorite in this palette and I'm applying this
2:15directly in the center of the lid
2:17wherever I didn't apply candy violet that's where i'm applying this and I'm
2:21just with the same brush just mixing them together so that they blend nicely
2:25into one another and then i just added some more salted caramel into my crease
2:31to highlight underneath my brow bone i took a white chocolate and then i'm
2:36going to go in with marzipan and i'm going to mix it with champagne truffle
2:39I'm gonna dip my brush into both of these shadows and i'm going to use that
2:43as my inner corner highlight
2:45yes ok now I'm going to take my room scandalize nude eyeliner and i'm going
2:51to apply this to my waterline I wanted a nude liner so that my eyes can look a
2:55little bit bigger and more fresh and then I took some candied violet and I
2:59applied it underneath my lashes and then I took salted caramel and bust it
3:04together
3:05I didn't show the shadows I don't know why but I just used candied violet and
3:09salted caramel and then i apply to some pico extra sculpt volume mascara and
3:14that completely eyes it was a very very simple
3:17I look I already have my foundation and my concealer and my powder on my face
3:21because I didn't want this video to be too long but i do want to show you
3:24really quickly
3:26the other products are used in my face so I'm just browsing up my skin with my
3:30Too Faced milk chocolate soleil bronzer i'm using the Knicks fan brush I believe
3:35that school is cold to highlight my face i'm going to take crushed pearls from
3:39the Anasazi aglow kit
3:41this is like the pinky er located I really really really love it
3:45it's amazing i'm just using crushed pearls to have first row
3:49yes to highlight tops of my cheekbones and my nose to get extra highlighting
3:54and glowy for blush i am taking the wet and wild ombre blush in the shade
4:00might I buy you a drink pretty sure that's the name of the blush it will be
4:04listed below
4:05it's a very sheer blush but it is
4:07really really pretty now i'm taking the econometrics waterproof nude lipliner
4:12this is called nude buff or buff nude and i'm filling in my entire lips with
4:17this I did overlined my lips
4:19I did it intentionally i wanted my life to look extra county and like bigger but
4:23don't do it if you don't like that
4:25I just you know want to change it up now i'm going in with the Makeup Forever
4:28plexiglass
4:30this is in the shade too old to this is a very thick but very glossy lip gloss
4:35so I want my lips to look glossy so that's what I did so that completes look
4:39number one very free daytime fresh
4:42I really love it if you want to see how to get look number two then let's jump
4:46right into that
4:47so I've already prime my lids and now i'm going in with milk chocolate on a
4:52fluffy blending brush and I'm just buffing this on the outer corners and
4:55then dragging it into my crease now taking this really pretty shimmery
5:05cranberry shade called amaretto and i'm applying this to my entire lid just like
5:11a flat shader brush
5:12I'm taking all the way up to my crease but I'm not passing my crease I just
5:15want it on my lid
5:17I wanted a little bit more in this eyeshadow so I took some mac fix+ and I
5:24sprayed it on my brush and then i went in with it like that and you can see
5:28that it just like intensifies the eyeshadow a lot more makes it look a
5:32little bit more metallic and foiled i recommend dipping your brush into the
5:36eyeshadow first and then spring 6 plus so you don't mess up your eyeshadow but
5:40yes that is what I did
5:42now I took the shade semi-sweet in the palette and on a skinnier and skinnier
5:47but like smaller blending brush
5:49I am just buffing this into my crease because i wanted the amaretto to blood
5:54nicely into my transition shape so I'm just using that to blend all the colors
5:58together
5:59and then I took a big fluffy brush and blend it some more
6:03you know no harsh lines I'm going into the shade cherry cordial it's such a
6:10pretty like Matt reddish color but it does have a little bit of glitter
6:13doesn't really translate on the lid much but it is stunning i love it so I'm just
6:18packing that onto the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging it into my
6:22crease a little bit so i took this essence smoky cool eyeliner in black and
6:27i'm just using this on my waterline and then I went back into the cherry cordial
6:33shade that map read and I am bluffing this on my lower lash line
6:37this is so pretty on the lower lash line I just I love red shades like this
6:42so with a pencil brush this is a more feet pencil brush I'm just buffing that
6:46on my lash line
6:47so breaking I love it then I went into hazelnut this color is so beautiful it's
6:52like a warm bronze shade
6:55I'm just buffing that on my lower lash line so that it's not too harsh under
6:59there and it's not like just a line of cherry cordial
7:02that makes sense yeah I just mix it in with a little bit he's not now I went
7:06into this essence cold again and i'm applying this really really really close
7:11to my top lashes and then blending it out with a pencil brush just to create a
7:15little bit of smokiness right at the base of the lashes but I didn't want to
7:19apply eyeliner
7:20that's a good little trick so now i'm going to highlight my brow bone and my
7:24inner corners i'm using a champagne truffle on my inner corners and then I
7:28used white chocolate underneath my brow bone so I went in with some mascara i
7:34use the Elizabeth ma it's so big mascara and then i apply some are dealt with
7:38bees in the shade 602 on my lashes it's a very natural fall / which is what i
7:43wanted and like before I have already foundation concealer and powder on but
7:49i'm going to show you the extra steps I took i'm taking my physicians formula
7:53butter bronzer and I'm not really contouring i'm just really warming up my
7:56face
7:57i'm using the two-faced mr. Wright brush
8:00it's like a tulip shaped brush it's amazing so just warming up the skin you
8:04know
8:04you know the drill I took my to face love blush in the shade baby love
8:10I didn't show you the blush like the actual blush but it's just a really
8:13pretty nude color and then to highlight my face
8:16i'm using the makeup revolution aight highlighter in the shade radiant light
8:21it's kind of like a soft pinky highlight but it's so natural and beautiful i love
8:26it so inexpensive this is a great highlight some just highlight of my face
8:30with that and then for my lip
8:32I'm taking the colour-pop ultra satin lip in the shade magic wand it's
8:37probably my favorite ultra satin lip they have
8:40it's so natural and perfect for everyday it goes with so many looks and i've been
8:44loving this formula so i just applied that to my entire lips no lip liner or
8:49anything and then that completes look number two
8:54ok guys so that completes this video I hope this up huh
9:01i hope this video gave you some inspiration to bust out your chocolate
9:05bar palette again everything there's a ton of different looks you can do with
9:08this
9:08so I hope this helped some of you in some way thank you guys so much for
9:12watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next
9:15video bye
0:08hey guys todays video is going to be on this makeup look right here this is a
0:13full drug store
0:15look and i'm also using affordable brushes as well
0:18I really like this look it's an intense eyeliner but everything else is really
0:22soft like the soft pink in the crease and the face is really soft as well but
0:27the eyeliner is very intense it kind of comes in on the inner corners a little
0:31bit cat is this is a little bit different for me because i rarely ever
0:36wear eyeliner but after i did this look I'm like eyeliner crazy i love it so i
0:41really really hope you guys enjoy this look and let me know in the comments
0:44what you think
0:45so if you want to see how to get this look then just keep on watching
0:49so I'm going to prime my eyelids as usual I like primers like this that also
0:54work as a base because they cover up all those ugly little veins on my eyelids
0:58and that was the LA girl Pro primer
1:01I'm going to dip my finger into this white eyeshadow in the Saudi Akashic I
1:05on neutral palette i'm using my finger because the only eyeshadow i don't love
1:09in this palette is the white one it's a little bit chalky so I like to use my
1:13finger then I'm going to take this fluffy blending brush from Delhi em
1:18tools i will link all the brushes down below as well so I'm taking this fluffy
1:22crease brush from valium tools and i'm applying that pink color directly in the
1:26crease and i am putting this sucker everywhere I wanted to very pink in my
1:30crease and i'm going to take this elf brush and I'm going to dip it into this
1:34cool tone brown
1:36it's a light cool tone tannish Toby color and i'm going to start applying
1:40this on the outer V of my eye and bring it into my crease so I'm just packing it
1:45on the outer bien
1:46and drag me into the crease this am I shadow brush is really easy to do that
1:50since its fluffy but flat at the same time going back into the Sonia Kashuk
1:54palette i'm going to take this super Toby purplish kind of color and on that
1:59same brush I'm going to just do the exact same things so on the outer V and
2:03then bring it into my crease
2:04i'm using these two shades to kind of you know create some dimension and so it
2:09you know has different colors of that makes sense I'm going to take this
2:13little trail from one wild walking on eggshells trio and i'm mixing those two
2:18shades that was pointing at
2:19and i'm going to apply this on the inner half of my lid using this else brush is
2:23in one dollar brush and then i'm going to dip my fluffy brush again into the
2:29pink and i'm just going to blend everything out
2:32sorry I feel like I'm moving for that
2:34I'm going to dip that same elf brush into the white
2:37I'm really packing it into the white and applying this to my brow bone as a
2:41highlight
2:42I'm going to take this darker brown in the palette it's also very cool tone but
2:47i'm applying this right at the outer view my to create a darkness on the
2:50outer corners
2:52this is just a darker Brown than the other ones we were using and then I'm
2:57going to use my NYC liquid liner and i'm going to apply a very thick wing
3:01so what I like to do is I like to draw the line first and then do this and then
3:06fill it in
3:07so I do that kind of wing first and then I start brushing a little strokes in the
3:12end or corners just to connect everything and then
3:15yeah i got out of frame but all he did was fill in that part that makes sense
3:21I really suck at eyeliner but I just did my typical wing I go back and I fix it
3:26but i just did like a basic thick wing do whatever you guys want you don't have
3:30to do that so I primary face with a luminous primer and then i'm going to
3:34mix these two foundations
3:36this is the Maybelline fit me and the maybelline fit me matte and poreless I
3:41like to mix these two because i have dry skin
3:43so sometimes the fit me the original is a little bit to do it which I do love
3:47but mixing it with the new matte and poreless creates a beautiful like
3:51natural satin finish I love this combination and i'm using a small
3:55stiffer brush
3:57tiful know a small stipple brush from ELF because you have to work in sections
4:01with the matte and poreless because it dries really really fast and then I
4:06realized I had no hearings on sale
4:08so I'm just working in sections and i love this brush it gets in the mix and
4:12crannies of everything i don't know i really like it so that's what I'm doing
4:15then I'm gonna add some concealer to my under eyes this is the LA girl Pro
4:19conceal in natural and then i'm going to highlight some more so I'm using the
4:25Rimmel conceal and highlight little lighter concealer things and i'm going
4:30to apply this all over my face to highlight my face as well
4:37i'm going to use this brush from hell this is there a tapered highlighter
4:41brush and I'm going to use that to blend in a ball and I really love about
4:45brushes the studio line is really a portable and really soft like very soft
4:50I love there so I'm just letting that all in then I'm going to take my
4:54Maybelline and fit me powder in 135 from natural and I'm gonna set my concealer
4:58on my face but to set my under eye can see there i'm using this elf under I
5:03setting powder
5:04I like it because it's like light reflecting reminds me a lot of the laura
5:08mercier secret brightening powder but it's three dollars and not like a
5:12million then after that I'm gonna finish off my eyes and I'm going to take that
5:17same liquid liner and now i'm going to start a connecting this into the inner
5:21part of my eye doesn't make sense
5:22I'm making like a little triangle right in the inner tear duct and usually I
5:26don't add eyeliner there but i think it creates like a sexy cat eye look
5:30as you can see right there so that is what I didn't feel like it ties the
5:35eyeliner together really nicely and after that i'm going to take some black
5:39eyeliner i have been loving this from nicks it's there like gel eyeliner in
5:43black its new looks like their new eyeliner
5:46it's amazing guys it's a super black look so black I really love it
5:51I'm gonna take this equal tools angled brush and I'm going to dip it into the
5:55black eyeshadow and i'm going to set the eyeliner like bringing it really really
5:59really really close to my waterline and yeah it's just going to intensify the
6:02eyeliner on the lower
6:04- line after that I applied mascara to my top and bottom lashes and then i went
6:09in with some red cherry or fifteen lashes just finish off the I look I'm
6:14gonna tip this more feet crease brush into that brown shade and I'm just gonna
6:19keep it up the outer corner like that like I'm just going to apply it really
6:22softly right in the outer V kind of in the crease and I feel like it's just
6:27going to add a little bit more dimension and finish off the eyes
6:30so then i'm going to go ahead and do the rest of my makeup just my face makeup
6:34I'm gonna take this NYX high-definition blush in the shade
6:38taupe and i'm going to use this to contour this is al
6:42what is a powder brush from ELF like a I think it's like a powder foundation
6:47brush and i love it for contouring because it's not too small but it's not
6:51too big
6:52this is a very a she blushed I got to be color very a she's so perfect for
6:57contouring but just to warm up the skin a little bit not too much
7:01i'm gonna tip that same brush into my NYC son and bronzer bronzer in Montauk
7:07bronze just gonna warm it up a little bit because that taupe blush is like
7:11great like hella gray like super super a she's so you do have to be a little bit
7:15careful
7:18after that I'm going to take this beautiful like to love style brush from
7:21Delhi I'm tools and i'm going to use this to apply my blush
7:24this is the next High Definition blush in soft-spoken i believe i will leave
7:28all the information in the description box
7:31it's a really pretty light peachy color love this blush then of course the
7:36highlight my physician formula shimmer strip in naturally new and i'm applying
7:42that with an elf blush brush to the tops of my cheekbones and on the bridge of my
7:46nose
7:48and all that good stuff and I'm just going to do my lips this is the Rimmel
7:52exaggerate the liner in natural i believe it's what it's called and the
7:57reason i'm applying this lip liner is because the lipstick , to put on top
7:59looks awful without a lip liner underneath because it settles into my
8:04lines really badly
8:05none of the rest of those lipsticks and that line do but that one kind of
8:08settles
8:09but i love the color so i have to put a lip liner underneath and i'm using the
8:13Milani moisture matte lipstick and match innocence
8:16hey guys that completes the look I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank
8:21you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I
8:24will see you in my next video bye
0:17hey guys so today's a makeup tutorial is on this look right here it's like the
0:22most simplest look ever mainly wanted to do this video because i used the
0:31Maybelline Dream bronze a BB cream
0:34this product is like pretty new and I decided to take inspiration from it so i
0:38did like a very tanned skin bronzy makeup actually pretty tired of having a
0:44fresh tan on
0:46I don't know if my lights are showing that I mainly wanted to focus this
0:49tutorial on the face like a very bronze glowy face
0:53so the eyes are very very simple very basic
0:56i'm actually going to talk about this a little bit more at the end of the video
1:00so if you want a review on this product just stay tuned to after the tutorial
1:05and if you want to see how to get these little then just keep watching
1:09ok so I'm a fool and I didn't show you guys what I'm a mixing or what i'm using
1:16but I mix the Maybelline Dream pur BB cream and with the Maybelline Dream
1:22bronze BB cream like I showed you earlier i mix those two together because
1:26the bronze one on its own is a little bit
1:29- bronze so I wanted to mix in one with like more of a flesh tone or one closer
1:34to my face and then I realized in this clip that i didn't put on primer but
1:39that's okay
1:40this kind of work to the primer and a BB cream all in one but that glow girl look
1:47at that glow
1:47some intense bronze venus I like it
1:51so yeah Here I am showing you the two things that I mixed
1:57i'm thinking the NYX HD concealer in the shade of beige and i'm applying this
2:01underneath my eyes to kind of highlight and cover up my dark circles as well i'm
2:06playing out to my eyes as well to kind of use it as a primer and eyeshadow base
2:11i'm highlighting other parts of my face - like I always do that i'm going to
2:16take this dream lumi concealer and i'm going to apply that all over the areas
2:21that I applied that concealer because that can see there is kind of thick so
2:24applying this on top not only helps highlight but it kind of makes it easier
2:28to blend out that nyx concealer and of course blending that with my favorite
2:37concealer blending brush this is the sedona lace
2:40- 17
2:46yeah
2:58yeah
3:03now i'm gonna take the maybelline fit me powder in 135 creamy natural
3:09I cannot find 135 anywhere i hope they didn't discontinued because it's my
3:13favorite setting powder under the eyes from the drugstore and if they
3:16discontinued it will be very sad
3:18yes i'm just using that I want to take this bourgeois bronzing primer it's
3:22amazing look at it beautiful
3:24it's very similar to this Chanel too late and a Chanel whatever that's called
3:28it's very similar it's just like a mu see consistency and it's a nice warm
3:32bronzy color so i'm using my Real Techniques sculpting brush to just
3:37bronze up my face I'm not trying to like do any harsh contouring since this is a
3:40warmer bronzer
3:41I'm just giving myself more of a tan you no more war me
3:52this is a seal of blush
3:57what is this called what is called was called this is the Aqua glow water color
4:03blush and this is in the shade
4:05shimmering lotus I like to apply on the back of my hand first because it can get
4:08a little pins and then apply it to my cheeks is basically like a liquid blush
4:14it's not even a cream it's like a pure liquid blush it's kind of awesome
4:18I really like it's really pretty if you get used to like you have to get used to
4:22blending it out since it's so weird cause it's like a liquid out of them
4:25this is the Milani bronzer in the shade glow i use this more kind of like a warm
4:31blush because it's a bronzer but it has a little bit of pink to it and it's very
4:35shimmery it's actually really really pretty
4:38especially in the summertime I'm going to move on to my eyes I want to keep it
4:42very very simple so i'm using the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade glow a
4:47nice
4:47like when the shade i'm using this to highlight underneath my brow bone using
4:53a morphing brush not sure what that one is called I think it's the e 14
4:58maybe i'm also applying that in beach like in my tear duct area as well then
5:04I'm going to take the shade Cornelius by the way these both of these eyeshadows
5:07are from my collab with color pop the where the light is quad
5:12oh yeah i'm taking Cornelius and i'm applying this to my entire lid
5:21yeah
5:25I'm dragging that underneath my lower lash line as well this is a very very
5:29natural color but like i said i wanted to keep it very simple
5:33I'm going to take a fluffy brush to get right back into Cornelius and then apply
5:37this to my crease to kind of diffuse the look and just bring it up higher
5:48yeah
5:49I'm gonna take this milani Bella eyeshadow in the shade fellowship on
5:54such as stunning like white gold and our planet in my inner tear ducts and
5:59everything else is so mad i want a very bright in the corner then I'm going to
6:04take this
6:05a
6:06it was gone oh the kat von d ink liner
6:09I believe this is in the shame
6:12actually I have it here let me check to do this is in the shade Hemingway so i'm
6:18applying this really really close to my lash line as if i was going to wing it
6:22out but I actually don't get out I just create a line and i like it because it's
6:26brown it's not as harsh and then i'm going to apply two coats of my L'Oreal
6:32telescopic mascara and I also applied that to my bottom lashes for my lips I'm
6:37keeping it very very simple i'm just using the anastacio lip gloss in the
6:41shade and dressed and that's all I'm doing for my lips
6:45so yeah now if you want to see a readme review on the BB cream
6:49just keep watching so if you're watching this part of the video that you want my
6:56little review on this product I didn't want to do a whole separate review on
6:59this since i have that cover girl foundation review up and I don't like to
7:04review so much i like this product this is the second time i use it the first
7:10time I used it completely by itself and it wasn't my favorite because it's dark
7:15I have the 14 light to medium skin tones
7:19um and it's like a medium
7:22I wouldn't say it's for light to medium if you are super fair i recommend using
7:25this as a bronzer like as a cream bronzer or you can use this mixed in
7:31which is how i like to use it and if you are really really dark skin
7:34I think they might have deeper ones so the way that I like to use this is mixed
7:39with foundations when I'm tan because it is a bronzer kind of I like to mix it in
7:44like today I mix it in with my dream cure BB cream to get like a more light
7:48weight coverage and it works really really well this way
7:52I don't like the original BB cream the Maybelline by like this one has
7:55salicylic acid and it's it's good
7:57oh yeah this would be awesome if you want super jennifer lopez skin
8:01SI lo as superintendent for Lopez skin but you have a very very matte
8:06foundation so mixing in a little bit of this is just going to make it really
8:09dewy and bronzy I kind of really love that about this
8:12I like it to mix by itself no you could also use this like on top of your
8:17foundation just to kind of like bronzed up the skin like a liquid bronzer
8:21so I really like this idea I actually kind of love it
8:25I think it's really good i've only used it twice but i'm playing around with it
8:28and i really like how it's been working for me so i highly recommend it
8:31only if you have normal to dry skin oily skin stay away from this unless you're
8:36using it in certain areas as browser
8:38so yeah that is my quick little mini review I hope you guys enjoyed this look
8:42thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
8:45and I will see you in my next video
0:25hey guys so I am currently in a storm the power has almost gone out like four
0:32times so I'm like hanging by a string right now hoping that the power doesn't
0:37get cut off so that at least this lamp can illuminate me somewhat but today's
0:42video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right now
0:46it was perfectly sunny when i started doing this tutorial than halfway through
0:50it
0:51it started to pour like a mother and I like my power almost went out like i
0:56said and it was just it and I would have just stopped recording i would have
1:00filmed this tomorrow but i was already like doing my makeup and I was like
1:03they're my peeps most subscribers are my peeps they're not going to care if it's
1:07a little dark
1:08they never do because I'm always complaining about it and you guys are
1:11really nice about it huh
1:13it was an epic lightning no and I was waiting for the thunder but notice way I
1:20wanted to do a really deep smoky eye like a suitable for clubbing and stuff
1:25like that but since it is summertime I wanted to incorporate color as well so
1:29it is very dark and dramatic and klemish but it's also colorful - it's not your
1:35basic like a deep black silver look it's kind of fun and has a good twist to it
1:39colorful I like it anyway if you want to see a tutorial on this makeup look
1:43then you can go ahead
1:45keep watching so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to prime my eyes I'm
1:50using Urban Decay primer potion and then i'm gonna take a piece of scotch tape
1:54put on the back of my hand first and then put it right next to my I to create
1:59like a sharp cat eye effect i am taking my Urban Decay Naked basics palette and
2:04I'm taking the color called naked - I believe it's called and i'm just going
2:08to be applying this in my crease buffing this color in dipping my brush and
2:13little by little and just building up that color
2:15this is just going to work as a transition shade so that everything
2:18blend well then I'm going to take my NYX jumbo pencil in black bean
2:23I'm going to put this all over my lid and then blend it out with my finger
2:29for this tutorial i am using the Urban Decay electric palette i'm going to take
2:34the little brush that comes the palette and I'm dipping it into the color freak
2:39and I'm going to apply this to the inner part of my I just focusing it mainly
2:43near the tear duct area
2:51then I'm going to take this color right here it is called fringe is a beautiful
2:54teal and on the other side of the brush I'm going to apply this to my entire lid
2:59and putting black as a base is really going to make this eyeshadow stand out
3:03its gonna make it like a deep sea foam teal kind of color i don't know i really
3:07love how this looks right on top of black
3:09so yeah i'm just applying this to my whole lid right up to the crease then
3:15I'm gonna take a fluffy brush with no additional product and i'm just going to
3:18start blending out those edges
3:23yeah
3:28then I'm going to take a mac 217 brush and dip it into naked - from the Urban
3:32Decay basics palette and I'm going to start blending this out even more
3:37this is the type of look that does look kind of ugly and messy before it starts
3:41to look pretty but don't worry about it just keep truck in and keep blending and
3:45it'll all turn out just fine
3:46I'm gonna take this one right here called faint and i'm just going to blend
3:50some more like I said this is a lot a lot of blending because the colors are
3:54so vibrant and pigmented you want to make sure you blend them out nicely then
3:58I'm going to go back into the fluffy brush and just blend out the harsh edges
4:01and then because of all that blending some of the color did go away obviously
4:07so I'm just going to take that fringe color again and apply it to my entire
4:11lid and then I'm going to do the same with the free color
4:19now with my mac 217 i'm actually dipping it into the color fringe which is the
4:23blue one we put on the entire lid and i'm going to add some of this to my
4:26crease
4:32and then a fluffy brush with no additional product and just blending
4:37some more
4:38lots and lots of blending to highlight i am going to take the highlight shade in
4:44The Naked basics palette and apply underneath my brow bone and in my inner
4:47tear duct
4:49i'm going to create a thin wing and i am using the bombs showing eyeliner and its
4:53really good to use tape when it comes to doing a wing because it's foolproof and
4:57its really really easy the tape is going to act as a guideline
5:00so you just want to add a wing and even though it looks messy when you take the
5:02tape off it's nice and sharp so I'm just going to add a thin little wing
5:16then I'm going to take my Maybelline master drama eyeliner as always and I'm
5:19going to tight line with this
5:23yeah
5:28I'm going to take a flat shader brush and I'm going to take the black and the
5:30Naked basics palette and I'm going to start packing this really really close
5:34to the tape
5:35I wanted to be the darkest right at the edge of the tape so I'm just going to
5:40pack that color and then start dragging it towards the inner part of my eye so
5:44it's nice and faded
5:50and the color little by little so it's not too harsh
5:54then I'm just going to take off the tape and you see it's nice and sharp and with
5:58a white be i'm just going to clean up any fallout
6:01moving onto my face i'm using the chafing really powder gel and i'm going
6:06to use this as a primer yes it is for mana stats but its silicone base and
6:10it's good for your pores and stuff so that's what i'm using for my foundation
6:13i am using my l'oreal true match foundation and three natural buff and my
6:18trusty handy-dandy Real Techniques bunch
6:22I keep forgetting what this is called I think it's like an miracle complexion
6:25sponge i'm not i don't remember but seriously guys this sponge is amazing if
6:33you don't own it already i recommend it it's very affordable it's very
6:36comparable to the Beauty Blender and i love it
7:02I'm going to move onto concealer and i am using my Maybelline fit me concealer
7:05and 15 fair and i'm just gonna apply this underneath my eyes to cover my dark
7:10circles and to highlight a little bit
7:11I always do this step but you know the usual
7:21I'm not very careful when I do this I just make sure that my under eye area is
7:25nice and concealed and highlighted and then i'm going to first blend it out
7:27with the sponge and then i'm going to further blend it out with my Real
7:31Techniques contour brush
7:42to set it i'm going to use my Mac emphasize powder and this is just going
7:46to set the concealer so that it does not crease
7:51so moving on to the eyes again i'm going to take my Maybelline master drama
7:54eyeliner in midnight master and i'm going to use this on my waterline then
8:00I'm going to take this fake color again and I'm going to run this underneath my
8:04lower lash line all the way to my inner tear duct and I'm sorry it is really
8:08dark this is when I started pouring like crazy
8:11so again I apologize i'm gonna add some mascara to my top and bottom lashes this
8:15is the clinical lash doubling mascara and then i'm going to apply my red
8:19cherry lashes in 747 and more
8:22yeah 747 mmm i love these lashes they're amazing
8:25so yeah then I'm going to smell my bronzer apparently this is the too faced
8:30chocolate soleil bronzer
8:31it smells like chocolate and it's really good and I am just going to apply this
8:36all over my face contouring a little bit just rounding up my face
8:40this bronzer is so pigmented that you can get pretty heavy pretty quickly so
8:45just use a light hand with it
8:47i'm using my ELF complexion brush
8:50I believe that's what it's called and then I'm just going to apply this to my
8:53neck and underneath my chin as well
8:56for blush I'm using my NYX blush in the shade mom and being nice
9:01mavi pinky color it's really really pretty and it's light for my highlight
9:06I'm using the bombs mary-lou manizer and i am using my Sigma contour brush to
9:11apply this on my cheekbones
9:14i'm also going to apply this to the bridge of my nose and on my Cupid's well
9:19as well
9:27for my lips I'm using the NYX butter lipstick in the shade fun size and i'm
9:31applying this to my lips and then i'm going to top it off with buck some lip
9:35gloss in White Russian
9:42yeah
9:53elephants combination it gives it like a nice milky glossy pink

0:19now and it is using the brand new Urban Decay Naked 3 palette this is a look
0:24that I was wearing in right naked 3 review and swatches that i posted the
0:29other day and a bunch of you guys said you wanted to see a tutorial on the

0:47just because I feel like a lot of people have been getting this power recently or
0:51you guys are getting it for Christmas
0:52it's popula it's very popular right now so i figured it'd be really cool to do
0:56just a couple more tutorials with this palette but this tutorial specifically
1:00is a little special because i am doing it with my friend Shireen
1:04she is probably the first person I met on youtube and she was just so nice to
1:08me right off the bat she gave me like a little shout-out in her video when I
1:11have like 25 subscribers and I thought it was the sweetest thing and we text
1:15all the time she has become a really good friend of mine we talk about makeup
1:18all the time we're just like a bunch of girly girls talking back and forth so we
1:22decided it would be a good idea for both of us to upload tutorials using this
1:27palette
1:27she is doing a more daytime appropriate look and this is more like a sultry
1:32evening type of look
1:33i would i would totally wear this during the day but for people who don't like
1:38this much eyeshadow during the day think this would be a beautiful date night
1:42look because it's just it's really sultry and romantic anything that this
1:46would look so beautiful on pretty much every single eye color
1:50like literally this would look amazing on brown eyes like amazing

7:27watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next
0:13hey guys so today's video is going to be a quick eye makeup tutorial using color
0:20pop I shadows
0:21this is a top tutorial just because I'm only doing my eye makeup in this video
0:26I'm only doing my eye makeup in this video because I specifically want to
0:29show you how the colour-pop eyeshadows work on me or I wanted to show you this
0:33I look at everything on the rest of my face will be in the description box as
0:37per usual
0:38but anyway if you want to see this nice metallic gold I then just keep watching
0:41my eyebrows look super scary right now because I have nothing else on my face
0:47don't be alarmed ok so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to prime my
0:51eyelids and i'm going to be using the elf glitter primer to do that you don't
0:56only have to use this primer for glitter you can use it for just regular eye
0:59shadows - I find that it really helps out here
1:04your shadows to your eyelids this doesn't look like a tacky feeling to
1:09your eyelids
1:10but I find that these eyeshadows I'm get any skipping you know like if you were
1:13to apply a powder eyeshadow on top of a sticky base
1:16it was kind of like skipping it stuck but these are so light creamy that I
1:19find that they will get stuck
1:21I'm going to start by applying a color to my crease and for that I am
1:24going to take this color right here called smash it
1:28it isn't a matte eyeshadow by any means at all you can see but it isn't glittery
1:33or sparkly so for the crease it gives you a nice finish it does have like a
1:38sheen to it but it
1:39I think it's so pretty for the crease I'm going to take my more feet and b25
1:44brush this is like the perfect brush to apply this eyeshadow with
2:00I just decided to go ahead and do this I and then bring you in closer
2:03ok so next I'm going to take this color right here and it is called get lucky
2:08and it is literally my favorite eyeshadow
2:12out of all the color pop I shall I own it is incredible incredible incredible
2:16definitely recommend using these with your finger as i said in my review
2:23look at that look at that Sheen
2:27oh so good
2:39now i'm just going to take this one again which is the one I used in my
2:42crease taking that brush and blending out that gold a little bit
2:53and then going back in to get lucky and layering it again now because I don't
3:03have an inner corner or brow bone highlight type of color
3:06i'm going to just take my milani Bella eyeshadow in bella chiffon and i'm going
3:11to use that to highlight underneath my route
3:13ok let's get in the frame and it looks white in the pan but it has a beautiful
3:18gold Sheen to it
3:26ok
3:31this also is what I used to highlight my face and I'm just in love with this look
3:35okay and really quickly i'm just going to add a little wing i'm going to use my
3:38NYC liquid eyeliner in my Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner and I'm just gonna a
3:42little wing off camera i also added my Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
3:48midnight master
3:50ok so we are almost time for my lower lash line i'm going to take the color
3:53smash again
3:55and on this outer be brush from makeup geek i am going to run that underneath
4:01my lash line
4:09then I'm gonna take this really fun color it here called I heart this
4:14I need to be in the frame what is wrong with me
4:17it is called I heart this and it is absolutely gorgeous
4:22like out of this world and i'm going to take it on a tiny little brush like this
4:26this is from coastal sense
4:28and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my elf makeup lock and seal and i'm
4:34just going to pour some right onto the brush and then dip it into the product
4:40and this isn't gonna mess up the product at all because it is a cream product
4:43anyway so I'm going to do it right into the product and run that underneath my
4:47lash line and this is just going to intensify the eye shadow
4:51if you don't have this you could use mac fix+ or eye drops that all works the
4:56same
5:03yeah
5:08yeah
5:10you can get quite a bit of fallout with this eyeshadow that's why i usually do
5:13my eyes before but since this wasn't a full tutorial I just did my face makeup
5:17but when you do use eyeshadow i recommend using I'm doing it before your
5:22face makeup but its cord back into this makeup geek out of the brush and just
5:27going to get right back into smash and do that one more time and this time I'm
5:36going to bring it a little bit further down just to make it nice and bronze and
5:41smoky down there now I'm just going to curl my lashes apply some mascara I'm
5:50using mac and extreme dimension 3d blacklash longest night meta
6:01ok guys so that completes its eye makeup tutorial really hope you guys enjoyed it
6:05and maybe you check out the colour-pop eye shadows because they're so expensive
6:08there are five dollars a pop and they are good
6:12thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
6:14and I will see you in my next video
0:31hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look i'm
0:36wearing
0:37I know of course I have had a lot of requests in the past to do a bridal
0:41makeup look
0:41so I decided to do one specifically using the drugstore products and i'm
0:47also using all affordable brushes in this video as well I really really love
0:51this type of makeup and this type of look for weddings but I mean everybody
0:56has different tastes everybody wants to do different things this is just my take
0:59on really soft feminine bridal makeup
1:02by the way i will say this video is going to be a long one because it is a
1:05talk through tutorial actually had to empty on my memory card like almost at
1:11the end of the video so i know it's long i know sorry about that and actually fun
1:16fact that and I didn't have a wedding we couldn't afford one when we got married
1:19so we didn't have like a big wedding but if we would have had a huge like wedding
1:24or like a nice or even a small wedding
1:26this is the makeup I would have done something very very similar to this
1:30even though it is drugstore I would have done something very similar so anyway I
1:33hope you guys enjoy this video and if you want to see how to get this
1:36drugstore bridal little makeup then just keep watching
1:41ok so I'm just gonna get my hair out of my face really quick so I'm going to
1:44start off with eyebrows and normally I would do this step before coming on
1:47camera and filming out tutorial you guys know
1:49this but i have decided to do it on camera for the purpose of this video and
1:55look naked
1:56throughout this video don't I i'm going to be using the elf instant lift a brow
2:00pencil another really good drugstore brow pencil is the Knicks won it looks
2:06really similar to this
2:07it's in a pencil form with a spoolie on the end you guys know I like a bold bra
2:11but I'm gonna try to make my brows a little bit more natural
2:14although i really do love that look I think that a nice feminine brow is
2:18prettier on your wedding day
2:20all I'm doing is following the natural shape of my brows just shading them in a
2:24little bit darker so they look a little bit more visible more prominent
2:28okay so I got a little too bold
2:31all right just fill in your brows the way you are comfortable filling them in
2:36i am going to set them with a brow gel or a brow mascara because this is not
2:42enough on its own i don't think any brow product is enough on its own
2:46you are going to need something that's going to keep it in place all day even
2:49if you don't have long eyebrow hairs
2:51this is really going to make the product underneath it take a lot longer
2:55I always liked how I do my eyebrows the day that I do them on camera I hate them
3:01african hate them i'm going to start working on my face because the eye
3:04makeup i'm doing is really natural and there's not much fallout so I'm gonna do
3:08all my face makeup first
3:10i highly recommend a primer on your wedding day one that is really really
3:14good from the drugstore is the Knicks angel wheel
3:17I find that my makeup does last longer when i use this its oil free and it is
3:20really really really great for all skin types but because i do have really dry
3:25skin
3:26i'm going to add a little bit of the law real magic Lumi primer
3:31I'm going to mix them and i'm gonna apply it to my face like that
3:36yeah
3:42the foundation i'm going to be using today is the revlon colorstay foundation
3:45this is the one for normal to dry skin because the regular I cannot use its way
3:51too cakey and to share out the formula a little bit i am using a damp Real
3:56Techniques complexions fun to these are about seven dollars at ulta or anywhere
4:00they sell real techniques and i'm going to start balancing this onto my skin a
4:05beauty blender or ace wet sponge
4:08Wilshere out the coverage just a little bit and make the foundation look a
4:14little bit more natural on your skin and that's why i recommend if you are
4:18getting married not to use a really thick and cakey foundation because
4:24that's just not really flattering if you need really really full-coverage then
4:28using a beauty blender or a sponge like this will really help that this is a
4:34full coverage foundation but i am actually just applying a shear shear
4:39layer
4:44i'm going to drag it down my neck make sure to drag your foundation down your
4:51neck don't apply it straight to your neck but on just drag it down your neck
4:56so that everything matches better and it doesn't look like you have a foundation
4:59mask
5:00I'm gonna go in with concealer and you can see that i'm going to be using our
5:05the Allegro broken seals you can get this on the LA girl website la girl
5:09usa.com or drugstore com i believe yes i'm going to mix these two shades I'm
5:13gonna mix natural
5:15this is a more peachy color to counteract dark circles and then i'm
5:18going to use creamy beige really hate the packaging on this for me it's hard
5:22to squeeze out product but i'm using this product today in this tutorial
5:26because i find that has really great coverage and it lasts all the on my skin
5:31it doesn't look bad in photography and ice I'm telling you it last forever on
5:35the skin
5:43yeah
5:50just going to add a little bit on the bridge of my nose here and on my chin
5:56I'm not going to highlight anywhere else and I don't want to pack on the
6:00concealer because this is a thicker concealer
6:03so I don't want my skin to look cakey
6:06so I'm just blending this in with a real techniques contour brush
6:11I would normally go for a much lighter concealer underneath my eyes you guys
6:20know to brighten up under there and to look extra in production but you know
6:27for our wedding you don't want that stark white
6:29look underneath your eyes especially in pictures or anything like that
6:39this combo just looks a lot more natural on me
6:43so the next thing you want to do is set your under-eye concealer because if you
6:47don't set it with powder it will crease my favorite drugstore setting powder for
6:51underneath the eyes is the Maybelline fit me i also love this on my entire
6:54face with this shade specifically is for my under eye
6:58it's 135 creamy natural using the Real Techniques setting brush and I'm just
7:04going to set that up
7:12now the next step I wouldn't typically do but for anybody with normal to oily
7:18skin i highly recommend you setting your face with powder
7:20even if you have dry skin it might be a better idea to set your face makeup
7:24because it's just going to make it last longer
7:26i'm going to use the most a matte powder to set my face but i'm going to use a
7:30very very light layer of this
7:33sometimes I find that this can flash back and photography and make my skin
7:37look a little bit white
7:39by the way this the revlon colorstay foundation
7:43I think um the original has SPF but this one doesn't say it has SPF at all
7:50I don't know why the normal to dry skin one doesn't say it has SPF
7:54but if it does or if it doesn't it does not flash back in photography which is
7:57why i really like it
7:58and why would recommend it for like wedding makeup but anyway i'm just going
8:02to take this real techniques blush brush and dab it dab it dab it in ever so
8:08slightly and just set my face
8:15yeah
8:18never looked this matt crazy ok so now i'm going to contour my cheekbones
8:24just a little bit personally for me on your wedding day I don't think that can
8:28cart cart auction that Kim Kardashian structure is very flattering
8:33i'm going to use the elf contour palette and I'm going to use this elf mineral
8:37powder blush brush and I'm going to dip it into this cool tone color right here
8:56I don't know if you can tell what they gave me just a slight contour to this
9:00side of my face and I have a very large forehead is so much in a con call day so
9:06I'm just gonna contour around a little tense and bring it to the other sign and
9:15come forward and just a little bean and then do the same thing here i'm going to
9:25move onto bronzing the skin I contoured but I still want warmth back into my
9:29skin
9:30i'm going to use the physicians formula bronze booster it's probably one of my
9:33favorite drugstore bronzers because it's not a flat matte shade so i'm going to
9:38use a dell IAM tools and
9:42974 brush like a tulip shaped brush you can get these online at the lamb tools
9:48and I am just going to bronze the cheeks not contouring just loving this on my
9:53cheeks
9:54just like I said bronzing the skin
10:06i'm also going to bring this to my jaw line right here
10:10ok so now i'm going to go ahead and add a blush I think this is a beautiful
10:14beautiful beautiful like wedding makeup kind of blush this is the essence
10:20silky touch blush in the shade baby doll i got this for like two dollars at ulta
10:26it's a stunning pink it looks like a regular pink in the pan
10:29but it does have a sheen to it i'm going to use the more feet and 5 56 brush this
10:35brush is about ten . nine ninety nine and I technology and i'm just going to
10:41pop this on my cheeks
10:43now i do recommend going a little bit overboard not okay not overboard by
10:51adding a little bit more blush then you usually would because that is the first
10:55thing to go on your skin
10:57so you always want to apply a little bit more than you normally would because it
11:01is going to fade
11:01anyway so just remember that I'm just popping it right here to the apples
11:07swirling it around and then bring it back to blend everything
11:18ok so because my face is really really mad right now and I like glow I mean I
11:23do have a little bit of love my cheeks but I like a nice glow
11:27I'm first going to going with the wet and wild color icon bronzer
11:31this is not a bronze are clearly this is a blush
11:35I mean he highlight and this is in the shade reserve your cabana this is the
11:39most subtle highlight ever like the most subtle highlight in my collection
11:43when it comes to the drugstore but it gives your cheeks like a glow from
11:47within so i highly recommend this for those of you who have large pores who
11:51have like textured rough textured skin because this is not going to emphasize
11:56your skin
11:56what so ever going to give you a very subtle glow so if you like a band
12:00highlight that don't go for this but it's not going to emphasize your skin
12:03which is what i really really like about this i'm going to take the elf
12:08no this is not off the siding brush by Real Techniques and i'm going to lightly
12:14start highlighting
12:18this is a stunning highlight four Brides because it is so natural especially for
12:25those of you with oily skin because it's not going to be too much you're not
12:30going to look really you're just gonna look like you are naturally glowy
12:34can you see it it's very subtle so I'm going to take this on the bridge of my
12:38nose
12:39so the first thing I'm gonna do is prime my eyelids you want to make sure that
12:46you are priming your lids especially on your wedding day because you want your
12:50eye makeup to stay in place the entire day this is the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow
12:54primer so the eyeshadows i'm going to be working with come from two products
13:01the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and the wet and wild walking on
13:07eggshells little trio
13:09I'm going to take this eyeshadow brush from ELF this is from there one dollar
13:13line and I'm going to dip it into this color right here it's a nice pink
13:16champagne and i'm just going to apply this to my entire lid
13:32i'm also going to take that same brush with that same eyeshadow and i'm going
13:36to apply this to my inner corner
13:42i'm also going to take this color here labeled brow bone and it's a white with
13:48a little bit of gold chain
13:49so I'm going to go right on top of this just to make it even brighter and I look
13:54scary right here but it all ties together
13:57now i'm going to take this Real Techniques domed shadow brush and I'm
14:02going to dip it into this color right here labeled crease
14:06it's a really pretty of warm brown it has a little bit of a sheen to it
14:11nothing too crazy i will be putting this into the crease and even though it has
14:14shimmer it doesn't look bad but first I'm just going to start packing it right
14:18here on the outer corners just a little bit and then i'm going to start dragging
14:25it up into the crease
14:28yeah
14:43now i'm going to take the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matter how I taking this a
14:47regular eyeshadow brushes and go ahead and use the same alpha brush
14:51this one is from Coastal Scents the only a few dollars and i'm going to take this
14:54brown right here right in the middle it's a nice neutral ground up to warm up
15:00the pool and i'm just going to put this on the outer corners of my eyes a little
15:04bit just to deepen them up a bit not too much then I'm just going to drag a
15:09little bit into my crease here for my problem highlights I don't want anything
15:17too stark too shimmery too bold
15:21so I'm going to just take the same highlight i use on my face this wet and
15:24wild reserve your cabana
15:25this is a neckl tools eyeshadow brush and I'm just going to apply this to my
15:32brow bone
15:33this is just going to lift the brow a little bit
15:36ok so at this point you can do a winged eyeliner look or whatever if you really
15:45want to i'm not going to do that I want to do something a little bit softer so
15:49I'm gonna take the Sonia Kashuk palette and I'm going to use this matte black
15:53shade right here and we're going to use it as an eyeliner and using a an
15:57eyeshadow as an eyeliner is just going to make it a little bit softer and not
16:00as harsh so I'm taking that same brush i just used to highlight my brow bone and
16:04flipping it over cuz it's a double-ended one and i'm going to use this little
16:08angled one
16:17for my lower lashes i'm just going to take this equal tools brush right here
16:21this is called the flat eyeliner brush and I'm just gonna do it right into this
16:25brown that we put in our crease and put that right
16:31really really close to the water line
16:38but to add a little bit more definition i'm going to take the brown that we used
16:42on the outer corners of our eyes in this palette
16:44this one here this one in the middle and i'm just going to add some to the outer
16:49corners now typically on a day-to-day basis i would just add black or brown
16:57eyeliner but i'm going to add a nude eyeliner this is the Rimmel wake me up
17:02know what like me up for the cover the rear most can analyze coachella
17:06waterproof eyeliner in the shade new applying this to my waterline because
17:11this is really going to bring it up the eyes make them look bigger instead of
17:14using a black which would make them look smaller so applying a nude eyeliner is a
17:19nice little trick
17:20so I will be applying falsies don't feel like you have to if you have nice
17:24luscious long lashes go ahead and apply some mascara
17:28I'm gonna a pile on the telescopic carbon black mascara from l'oreal before
17:34i go in with falsies
17:36ok so these are the finished eyes right here
17:42all I did was apply mascara to my bottom and top lashes and then i went in with
17:46policies and the ones I used you can see them cause I mean there are my eyes but
17:50they are from our dell and they are the dummies
17:54ok so for my lips I would normally do because it's like wedding makeup I would
17:58do a lip liner lipstick and lip gloss on top so i think glossy lips are pretty
18:03like for a bright
18:05i'm gonna go ahead and just skip the lip liner today because the lip liner I
18:10wanted to use which is east and not by Rimmel I'd emerges
18:15so i'm going to go ahead and take the Milani lipstick in the shade nude cream
18:20i think this is a stunning bridal lip color i think it's so pretty
18:25just going to apply the online and
18:27lips
18:30and then to add a nice glossy like top coat
18:36i'm going to use the Knicks mega shine lipgloss in the shade
18:40sugar pie right yes sugar pie it has a sheen to it so it makes your lips look
18:45nice and juicy

2:32bit when I was applying it as you saw this is the milk chocolate silly not the
2:36original this one is much lighter i love this one for my skin when I'm a little
2:41more fair that i decided to add just a little bit of a pinky warmth penis with

2:54highlight my face i'm using the elf sunkist bronzer in the shade sun kissed
2:58it's not a bronzer but it is a very very golden highlights
3:02it's a very strong gold but it's such a beautiful highlight and it is two bucks
3:06at your local target or wherever they sell elf

0:14hey guys so today's video is a makeup
0:17tutorial on this look right here this is
0:20the look I was wearing in my morphe
0:21palette swatches video that i posted on
0:23monday
0:24it's just a little bit more intense i
0:25added a little bit more black eyeshadow
0:27than I did that day and I added a little
0:29bit of a gloss on top as well but more
0:31or less that's pretty much the exact
0:33same look i will link this palette down
0:35below in case you're interested i also
0:37have a ten percent off code with morphy
0:39in case you're interested
0:40it's just kathleenlights safety ten
0:42percent but yes i will exist below this
0:45is my personal favorite look to do with
0:47this palette because it's so smoky and i
0:49love it for going out at night clubbing
0:51a romantic dinner i love how super smoky
0:54eyes pair with a really really nude lip
0:57but if you're not into that super nude
0:58lip i know a lot of people aren't just
1:00pop on whatever color you want and I
1:03know I say about time that this look is
1:04actually super easy because there's no
1:07winged eyeliner or any false lashes of
1:09course you can add a wing you can add
1:11some false lashes make it even more
1:13dramatic but I feel like they look smoky
1:15and dramatic enough to where it doesn't
1:16need eyeliner or false lashes so if
1:19you're someone who just doesn't mess
1:20with the falsies or the eyeliner this
1:22look is definitely for you and yeah I
1:24guess that's only have to say you want
1:26to get this look then just keep watch
1:30ok so i have already primed my eyelids
1:33and i'm going in with my milani shadow
1:35lies in black ink by the way I'm getting
1:39a cold so my voice is very Gracie right
1:41now but i'm just using this as a base
1:44underneath my eye shadows it's just like
1:46a black chubby crayon i'm going to take
1:48this light orangie peachy color in my
1:51crease from the palette and this is
1:54going to be the transition shade i'm
1:56really gonna pack this color into my
1:57crease because i want the crease to be
1:59very very warm and then i'm going to go
2:01in with this bronze shade right here and
2:03I'm just going to take a flat shading
2:05brush and apply this to my entire lid
2:08right on top of that black color
2:11now I'm going to take that peachy color
2:15again and I'm just building some more of
2:17this color into the crease and then I'm
2:20gonna go back into the palette and I'm
2:21going to use this gray cool tone brown
2:24color and i'm going to use this to kind
2:26of blend those two eyeshadows together
2:28the bronze and the orange this is gonna
2:30be like a sandwich in shade just using
2:33this to blend out the edges making sure
2:35there are no harsh lines and then I'm
2:37going to take this light matte color in
2:39the palette and I'm going to use this as
2:40my brow bone highlight i'm going to add
2:43another color on top of it but just for
2:45now that's the brow bone highlight
2:46excuse so I'm gonna take the black in
2:50the palette and I'm just packing this
2:51color on the outer corners of my eyes
2:53and slightly dragging this into the
2:56crease I want to make the look nice and
2:58smoky i'm just applying that black
3:00little by little and then I applied some
3:03more of that bronze color on the inner
3:04part of my eye to intensify the shade a
3:07bit i'm going back into that cool tone
3:12grey brown color and I'm just blending
3:14some of that into the greats
3:16I'm going back in with the bronze chain
3:18you know just layering so I'm going to
3:20start with my face makeup before i
3:21finish up the eyes and i'm taking my NYX
3:24angel primer as my primary to smooth the
3:27skin and then i went over it with the
3:29maybelline fit me Matt and poreless
3:31foundation and i'm just applying that by
3:34bouncing a damp sponge on my face so for
3:38concealer i'm using the trees liquid
3:40camouflage high coverage concealer i

3:45definitely one of my favorites at ulta
3:47and it's like three or four dollars i
3:49love it i'm just applying this
3:50underneath my eyes to not only highlight
3:52my face a little bit but to cover up my
3:54dark circles
3:55this has really really great coverage

4:00set that down i'm using the NYC smooth
4:03skin loose translucent setting powder
4:05and i'm just sitting everywhere put some
4:08concealer down
4:10ok so to finish up the eyes i'm gonna
4:12take that first shade in the palette and
4:14just apply a little bit underneath the
4:16brow bone and then I took a little bit
4:17more of that peachy orange shade and
4:19apply some in my crease and then i
4:21applied the same BTW orange shade
4:24underneath and lower lash line and then
4:26I took my next pleasure Lee gel pencil
4:30liner in the shade pitch black and I use
4:32that to tightline and to apply to my
4:34waterline as well and then I'm gonna
4:37take a smaller little pencil brush and
4:39I'm gonna take that grayish brown color
4:41and i'm going to focus that really
4:43really close to my waterline I'm sorry
4:45that these parts of the video are a
4:46little bit blurry
4:47I don't know why my camera was not
4:49focusing on my eyeball it was like
4:50focusing on my hair so strange i'm sorry
4:52but I applied some of that to my lower
4:54lashline and then at the very outer
4:56corners I applied some of that black
4:58eyeshadow with the same brush I took
5:01some more of that peachy color on a
5:03fluffier pencil brush and just blend it
5:05all those eyeshadows together nice and
5:09smooth and blended and I just curled my
5:11lashes and I applied my it cosmetics
5:13superhero mascara and that's it
5:17wait what's happening although we have
5:19to highlight my inner corners ok so i
5:21took the first shade in the palette and
5:23I highlighted my inner corners with that
5:25because it's so intense and so
5:27brightening and i love it but now we are
5:29done with the eyes
5:30ok so for my face i'm contouring my face
5:33using the chemical on sculpting powder
5:35in the shade light and I'm just
5:38contouring my face with this this look
5:40is kind of you know dramatic and smoky
5:42so I want to make sure I'm carving out
5:44my cheekbones and i'm contouring but i
5:46also wanted a little bit of warmth to
5:48the face i wanted to bronze up the skin
5:50a little bit so i use the hourglass
5:52ambient lighting bronzer in the shade
5:54luminous bronze light and I'm just
5:57putting that everywhere
5:59then I'm gonna I'm not necessarily bake
6:02but i'm just going to clean up my
6:04contour a little bit using that same NYC

2:03base this primer is amazing with color pop shadows because it really helps them
2:07stick to your lids
2:09I love this primer and then I'm going to take translucent powder and just dust
2:13that over my lid so that everything blends smoothly
2:17so I'm going to take makeup geeks eye shadow in the shape creme brulee and
2:21this is a stew for a pro blending crease brush and I'm just dusting this into my
2:25crease as my transition shade then I'm going to take mirage also by makeup geek
2:30and i'm going to use this as my brow bone highlight
2:33it's kind of like a mix between a mat and machine it's a really pretty eye
2:38shadow
2:38now i'm going to take Porter from the quad and i love this i should look at
2:44this border i love it so much and i'm going to start by applying this with my
2:48finger and I'm just putting this on my entire lid and then I decided to switch
2:57over to a synthetic brush synthetic brushes work best with color pop I
3:00shadows as opposed to like natural hair brushes so i'm just applying this all
3:04over my lid bringing it up to the crease and make making sure that everything is
3:08nice and blended
3:15and then I'm just going to go back into the eye shadow and making it more
3:19pigmented on the lid and then I got out of the frame you know as usual
3:23so I'm going to take makeup geeks eyeshadow in the shade cocoa bear and
3:27this is another brush pipe here it looks like a mac 217 only it's like a
3:31synthetic version which is perfect to blend out colour-pop eyeshadows and i'm

3:54finger and then i'm going to go back into the shade porter and i'm going to
4:00apply this to the outer corners and the inner corner
4:03I'm trying to create like a halo I effect I only want we need to stand out
4:07like right in the center of the lid so i'm going to move onto my face before I

0:14hey guys so today's video is going to be on this makeup tutorial
0:19it's like a totally silvery cool tone look out of my comfort zone a little bit
0:23but i think it's so pretty
0:24it's also really suitable for prom I feel like if you're wearing a topi dress
0:29or like a purple dresses look really pretty i like it so much and I hope you
0:34do too if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching my
0:38friends so I'm going to start out by priming my eyelids using Mac's painterly
0:42Paint Pots get rid of all those veins on my eyelids and two prime them of course
0:47I'm gonna go into this tart tartlets palette right here and on this way of a
0:52brush I'm going to dip it into the color free spirit and basically what I'm doing
0:57is just kind of studying at the base i put down so it's not sticky
1:01then I'm going to go back into the palette and I'm gonna do a fluffy
1:05blending brush into the shade natural beauty
1:08this is like a really light mabi purpley great color
1:12so it's perfect as a transition shade so that's what i'm using it for
1:16I'm just a buffing this back and forth into my crease so that all the other
1:19eyeshadows that I put down on my lid blend nicely into the crease at that
1:27then with a more precise blending brushes from soil but it's just like a
1:33mac 217
1:34I'm gonna dip it into the shade best friend this one is a lot more purple
1:38it's basically just like a mid-tone like matte purple color everything in this
1:42palette is matt by the way and so i'm just applying this to the outer V of my
1:46eye and bringing into my crease
1:49I'm going to take this josie maran water color eyeshadow in the shade apply as L
1:53pink and i'm going to apply this to my lid using the little sponge tip
1:58applicator and then I'm going to blend it out with my finger it's like a really
2:01concentrated metallic pigment so I'm just taking my ring finger and just
2:05blending and out then for my favorite part i'm going to take this pigment from
2:12makeup geek in the shade nightlife
2:13it's a beautiful like to see like champagne with like a totally unknown oh
2:20I know it's really gorgeous on the lid and i'm going to apply this all over my
2:25entire lid up to the crease to intensify that pigment a little bit more i'm going
2:33to take mac fix+ and I'm going to spray my brush with it and then dip it back
2:36into the pigment and this is just really really going to intensify the eyeshadow
2:41it's going to make it more metallic and bring out like the topi undertone a lot
2:45more
2:50and then I got out of the frame a little bit but basically i just put it in my on
2:53my entire lid you get the gist
2:56going back into that tartlet palette I'm gonna take a right back into best friend
3:00and i'm going to apply this right into the crease and i'm using a very very
3:04precise like pointy blending brush it's kind of like a pencil brush and I really
3:09want a lot of the purple to be concentrated into the crease so that's
3:13why I'm using a pencil brush
3:14I'm just taking my time going back and forth and yeah after I do that I'm just
3:26going to blend everything out so there are no harsh lines
3:29I'm taking that fluffy blending brush again sigma e40 and I'm going to get
3:33right back into natural beauty and then I'm just gonna buff everything out into
3:37my crease
3:37I wanted some more purple in my crease but I didn't want it to look harsh i'm
3:41not i did into a cut crease or anything I just want everything to look nice and
3:45diffused and blown out then I'm going to take this shape called super mom and
3:52this is gonna be my highlight it's like a very like a light light light peachy
3:57pinky kind of color and it makes a really nice matte highlight under the
4:00brow bone and i'm going to take this milani I text perfection liquid liner in
4:04black and I'm going to start doing my wing
4:07the way that I really like to do it is I apply a super super thin layer as close
4:12to my lashes as possible and then I make it thicker as I go so I just make the
4:17base really really thin and then just start you know making the
4:21it's thicker but then i get out of the frame as per usual and that went to
4:26cross
4:27I'm going to take this dick gel liner in black
4:32the new like tres Jolie ones they're my favorite black eyeliner from the
4:36drugstore as of right now and i love them so i'm just going to tight line
4:40with it and then I'm just going to go ahead off camera and apply my are dealt
4:44with
4:44I'm gonna finish off i'm going to start my face before I finish off my eyes
4:49i'm priming my face using the Makeup Forever HD primer and then i'm going to
4:53go in with the Bourjois healthy mix serum foundation
4:57usually I would go for like a more full coverage foundation especially for prom
5:02but my skin was acting super sensitive and I wanted something that was like
5:07light weight on my face like I wanted my foundation to be a little bit more
5:11lightweight so that's why I'm using my favorite which is the Bourjois healthy
5:15mix serum
5:16I'm in the shade 52 i'm just applying that all over my face using a Real
5:20Techniques buffing brush and then with a real techniques like powder brush I'm
5:25going to go into the Bourjois healthy balance powder and i'm just going to
5:29powder my face a little bit
5:32stay away from my under eye area specifically because i'm going to go in
5:35with concealer next
5:37and i'm using it the Maybelline master concealed by a studio and on a Real
5:42Techniques contour brush i'm applying that underneath my eyes and then I'm
5:46just going to blend it up
5:48somewhere blend it out blend it out yeah I'm just bringing that up
6:00i also put them on the bridge of my nose and other parts of my face
6:04highlight with the concealer I'm gonna be setting that with mac emphasized
6:09powder
6:10this is a really nice brightening powder and it's good to set your under eyes if
6:14you want like a bright under eye effect which I do especially for night time
6:18we're going out i love the under eye to be nice and bright
6:26yeah
6:30now i'm going to go ahead and finish off the eyes i'm taking a sigma pencil brush
6:34and I'm going to dip it into natural beauty and i'm going to start smoking
6:38that on my lower lashes by the way i filmed this tutorial literally at three
6:41o'clock in the morning so that is why my eyes are so red i was dead tired but I
6:49really wanted to get this video for you guys because you know I didn't have a
6:53video on wednesday and i just wanted a video up but anyway I did that same
6:57pencil brush into the shade best friend and I'm smoking it out even more and
7:03after that i'm going to add some of that same eyeliner from nicks to my water
7:07line just to make it nice and deep on the lower lash line then I'm gonna take
7:11the super dark purple in this palette it's called bombshell and i'm going to
7:15really smoke it out again with the same pencil brush and then i just applied the
7:22mascara and then I am done with the eyes
7:26so moving up to the face I am taking my girl lactic bronzer in the shape Cabo
7:30this is my favorite bronzer of all time and i'm using the Real Techniques multi
7:34tasking brush to just a bronze up my face for some reason my bronzer was kind
7:39of washed out on camera but like I had like an intense bronzing contraction you
7:44just couldn't really tell that much
7:46yes so I'm just contouring kind of and bronzing at the same time for blush I'm
7:52using this tart one called celebrated its like one of their new blushes and it
7:57is beautiful i love it it's a very very soft pink I'm not crazy for blush like
8:01in an intense blush look
8:03so this soft pink is so perfect with so many looks and then i'm going to
8:07highlight my face using the physicians formula i could open it up there you go
8:12shimmer strip in Miami strip my favorite highlighter of all time drugstore
8:17high-end it's my favorite
8:19and I'm just highlighting with I believe this is the waiver like paper
8:23highlighter brush and the brush I use to apply my blush with a mac one like the
8:27mac blush brush but yeah
8:31then i'm going to go ahead and finish off this look by doing a little lip
8:35combo here and my little lip liner broke a little bit
8:39this is a eight colour-pop lippie pencil in the shade skimpy and i'm just
8:44applying that to my entire lip but then i thought it was way too warm for this
8:48look so i'm going in with this next high voltage lipstick in the shade stone
8:53it's such a cool unique like beautiful nude they have a lot of gray to it
8:58I don't know it's really really pretty but yeah
9:01that completes this makeup look thank you guys so much for watching I really
9:04hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my
9:09next video bye
0:06hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the makeup I'm
0:10wearing this is using the anastacio shadow couture palette
0:14this is what it looks like I of course kept it to the very warm eyeshadows in
0:21this palette I really really loved this look actually did a good day when I was
0:26just getting ready and I post them on snapchat like why I really like how it
0:29turned out I should have filmed this tutorial and it got super requested
0:33after that i posted a picture of me wearing it on Instagram and pretty much
0:37everyone commented
0:39please do a tutorial on this look so that is what i'm doing right now
0:42I love it when I saw cells pallets like this because you get a ton of eyeshadows
0:48and they're like $35 I think so it's really good it's a lot of bang for your
0:53buck and the quality of the eyeshadows are really nice
0:56I really really love this palette it's probably my favorite one so far just
1:00because I just love these warm colors but then you have pops of color down
1:06here as well it is a little bit different than the look I posted on
1:09Instagram I made it just a little darker a little bit more Brown in my crease and
1:15stuff like that I just made a little bit more dramatic but i really love this
1:19look I wasn't going to post it because I do so many like chocolate looks but it
1:23was requested
1:25just keep that in mind if you comment like you do it looks like this all the
1:28time it was requested okay so yeah if you want to see how to get this look at
1:33this
1:33angels game while watching I primer of choice today is the mac 24 hour extended
1:38I base I just recently discovered this and it's probably one of the best
1:42eyeshadow primer is i have ever used going into the Anasazi palette i am
1:46taking soft peach and I'm packing this all over my entire lid just to set that
1:51I base we just put down now I'm going to take a fluffy crease brush this is from
1:56sephora i'm going to dip my brush into the shade morocco and I am packing this
2:00in my crease this is kind of like my transition shade and i'm putting this
2:04everywhere pretty much just slowly dipping the color dipping the brush back
2:08into the color and just intensifying it going back and forth until I wanted
2:13exactly how I want it
2:15yeah does it make sense taking another brush I'm going into the color fudge
2:19it's the chocolatey color in the palette and I'm putting this all over my entire
2:23lid bringing it right up to the crease
2:31now i'm gonna take this one I'm pretty sure it's called Bellini it's a really
2:34pretty peach
2:36this is just like a random eyeshadow brush from urban decay that i got in the
2:40electric palette but i like it to pack on eyeshadow so I'm putting this all
2:43over the lid on top of that fudge color then applying fix+ to the brush and I'm
2:49just intensifying that color even more because adding of the fixed plus really
2:54makes this eyeshadow like a peachy metallic finish so i wanted to add the
2:58fixed plus to intensify it then I'm going to take a brush really similar to
3:02the mac 217 it's like a tapered crease brush and I'm a taking I'm not taking
3:06the fudge color and i'm putting this directly into my crease
3:10I don't want it as sloppily as the Morocco shade
3:13I want to make sure that that Braun stays focused in the outer V of my eye
3:17and in my crease as well so I'm just slowly building that color going back in
3:23to Morocco I'm just blending everything out so that the lines aren't too too
3:27harsh
3:28I'm not just going to take a white eyeshadow to highlight my brow bone
3:32since there isn't an eyeshadow light enough
3:34in the Anasazi palette this is just a white eyeshadow from a little rock
3:38palette
3:38we use any eyeshadow you want i dip my brush into the shade noir just to apply
3:43it really close to my lashes so that it can look like I have some eyeliner I'm
3:48just smudging it there just for the you know effect of eyeliner so i'm going to
3:53move onto my face before I finish my eyes I'm taking this tiny little sample
3:56i got for a mac it is there strobe cream
3:59it came when like ordered something the other day and I
4:02loved it like I love this as a primer it just makes my face so do it i love it
4:07now i'm going to take my makeup forever ultra HD foundation and i'm applying
4:11this on my entire face using a Marc Jacobs brush you don't need this brush
4:16honestly it was way too expensive but I wasn't the one who bought it was a
4:20present but it's really amazing but I don't recommend it
4:25just because it's so so pricey there's tons of brushes that do the same thing
4:30so i'm just applying it because you know it was a gift from Danny
4:34huh so I'm just using it anyway yeah so I applied the ultra HD foundation all
4:39over my face I mean why 335 it's like more of my Tanner shade but we're making
4:44it work so i'm using the Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser
4:49this is in the shade affair and i'm using this underneath my eyes to cover
4:53up some dark circles and to highlight my face but to further highlight I'm taking
4:57the Mac prep and prime pen in
5:00yep wipe that off your nose and i'm using what is called but it's got like
5:05boost
5:05it's the yellow one and i'm using this to highlight on the rest of my face and
5:09I added a little bit more to the under eye area just to further bryson and then
5:13I'm just blending that in but i'm not using us a doorman lace brush surprised
5:18i know but my son always brush was really really dirty so i just use this
5:22one for more feet
5:23it's not as good but it got the job done you know so yes just I just blended that
5:29and you've seen me blend in my concealer about a million times but yes
5:34all right
5:37i'm setting my under eye concealer using this NYX HD powder in the shade banana
5:41it's like the yellow powder i love it I've been using it a lot and I really
5:44love it
5:45so I'm using an elf tapered brush to just blush
5:49- elf tapered brush to set my concealer i'm setting everywhere I put that
5:54concealer
5:57alright so let's finish these eyes
6:01I'm taking this flat sort of brush by Sigma and I'm taking fudge and i'm
6:07applying it really close to my lower lashes and then I'm going to take more
6:12and do the same thing but on the outer corners I'm not dragging it all the way
6:16in like I did with fudge and then I'm just going to take morocco and blend
6:20everything out with a pencil brush to smudge it real good make sure everything
6:23is nice and blended and a smoky
6:26so now for mascara I'm using my L'Oreal telescopic and I was like whoa did I
6:31break it but no it was just a packaging malfunction
6:34this is the telescopic carbon black and I'm just coding my top and bottom lashes
6:38with this you can do falsies but I just decided to skip it then I'm going to
6:42take this pencil brush and i applied mac fix+ to it and I'm gonna dip this brush
6:47into the pink champagne color adding fix plus it's up to this eyeshadow
6:51intensifies it by like a million it makes it super foil and metallic so i'm
6:56applying this to my inner corners to create a nice metallic pinky inner
7:01corner
7:01so this is the laura geller baked bronzer in medium and it looks so dark I
7:06was really scared the first time I used it but i'm using this real techniques
7:10multitask brush and if I focus my brush on the more whitish part of the bronzer
7:14actually really love the bronzer
7:17it blends really nicely because the baked product but it just looks so nice
7:21so I'm only using a little bit to warm up my skin I'm not trying to contour
7:25anything just adding a little bit of color to my face
7:31all right
7:34for blush I'm using Mac warm soul because it just goes so well with this
7:38eyeshadow look I love this blush it's so beautiful
7:41and yeah that's what I'm applying to my sheiks and when I posted this picture on
7:46Instagram i was using the jaclyn hill champagne pop Becca highlight but i
7:50decided to use something different so i'm just i went with the hard candy
7:54baked bronzer intiki and i'm applying this to mind the tops of my cheekbones
7:59and on my nose just to highlight my face because I love to highlight all right
8:04for lips i'm using this over a liquid lipstick in the shade sao paulo i don't
8:08want to say that now Paolo
8:10it's such a beautiful nude it's like amazing these liquid lipsticks are one
8:14of the best liquid lipsticks i have ever used
8:17seriously stunning i love them i highly recommend them so after that i'm
8:21applying this marc jacobs lip gloss and sugar sugar right on top and then I
8:26wanted my look to be a little bit more doing so i took this
8:29josie maran Nirvana hydrating treatment missed and applied it to my skin this
8:34isn't a setting spray it's more of a treatment but I like how it makes my
8:38makeup look so yes that completes this look

1:05I'm not going to okay I'm gonna say it i might like this more than my naked 2
1:09palette
1:11I haven't had it long enough to say that but i'm really loving the undertones in
1:17these eyeshadows so much more than I thought I would
1:20by the way i do not do my entire face in this tutorial you probably can't tell
1:25but I'm like getting the flu i just know i know it's coming and I know that
1:30people are mainly worried about the eyeshadows not what's on the rest of my
1:33face but everything that is on the rest of my face right now will be in the
1:37description box so if you're interested in like lip color or something
1:41just check down there because it'll be okay I'm gonna stop talking about by the
1:45way thumbs up this video if you want to see more naked 3 palette tutorials
1:49the first thing i'm going to do is take my Urban Decay primer potion
1:53because at the base of money
1:55you can kind of slip off if I don't have a primer which is this
1:59this is the NYX jumbo pencil in the color black meat
2:03I'm just gonna line it really close to my lash line and then just blend it up
2:07with my fingers but i'm not going to be taking a pass the crease
2:12now i'm taking this color right here called nooner and i'm going to be
2:14buffing this into my crease I really just want to blend out that black bass
2:19we put down and a lot of the Black is just going to blend always can see it
2:24starts like coming off but I do go back and add some more black to that to the
2:28spots that kind of disappeared
2:33now i'm taking the color limit and i'm just going to add this to my crease as
2:37well and just make everything nice and blended now i'm taking the color dark
2:43side and going to go all over the lid but i'm not really going to take it past
2:48the trees i'm just going to be putting it up to the crease
2:53and right here i'm just cleaning because this kind of has a little bit of fallout
2:57I'm just cleaning up and getting like a nice little sharp edge
3:00now i'm taking the color liar and I'm gonna be bluffing this into my crease
3:03this is just going to blend it really nicely from that dark side color to the
3:07matte shade in the crease
3:09I really like how it looks even though it is a shimmery color and then i'm
3:12taking burnout and i'm going to be doing the exact same thing for some reason I
3:16just think that these colors look really pretty together and like I don't know
3:19it's a good nice little transition then i'm taking my master drama eyeliner and
3:24midnight master and I'm going to line my waterline and then for my Bravo
3:28highlight i am just taking the color strange and i'm putting that in my tear
3:31duct as well and then I'm just adding some eyeliner to make that little winged
3:38liner and I do it off camera because they have to get super close to the
3:41mirror and then you just not be able to see me then I'm taking the color liar
3:45and i'm just going to buff this underneath my lower lash line just to
3:48kind of smoke it out and then I'm gonna soften the outer edges of that wing with
3:53that same eyeshadow and then I'm just going to pack on the mascara this
3:58tutorial was super quick and easy anybody could do it even a beginner so i
4:03really hope you enjoyed thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe
4:06if you haven't already and I
4:07see you in my next one
0:20hey guys so today's video and makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right
0:24now I wanted to play around with the new color pop colors for spring like a
0:29really pretty mint ocean turquoise and an insane
0:34blue and honestly this is very similar to look I've done in the past with
0:37different colors
0:38I even did a look very similar to this with color pops weenie and Porter but i
0:44just love this kind of our looks like the halo I where you have like a lighter
0:48shade in the middle it's one of my favorite techniques to use
0:51I do look like this all the time I just switch up the colors so yeah I wanted to
0:55play around with the new color pop colors these are available already and
0:58and ok so i tried the braids
1:01I love this hairstyle i love this since I was a little girl it reminds me so
1:04much of Miss hold up
1:06I've said this before in a video I feel but it reminds me of a little girl who
1:09miss Trent Boult throws over the fence by her braids by her pigtails
1:14even though hers weren't like this in the movie she just had like a regular
1:17break anyway
1:18Nicole Guerriero uploaded a tutorial on how to do this so i tried my best and I
1:23followed a long hair tutorial but I feel like I just suck I cannot do hair
1:27I suck so if you're frustrated because you can't do here with the same you and
1:31I you and I with the same but anyway if you want to see how to get this makeup
1:35tutorial right here
1:37then just keep watching ok so oddly enough i'm starting off with my face
1:41I never do i always start off with my eyes but we'll go with it
1:45this is the skin and Naevia primer spray and I'm just sprang that on my face and
1:50I'm going in with the new foundation this is the josie maran vibrancy argan
1:54oil foundation
1:55this is in the shade cause make and I'm liking it I think it's really nice
2:00sometimes I feel like it sits on top of the skin I need to play with it a little
2:04bit more but it's nice and dewy and
2:06I like it so far it's not my favorite but i really like it so far so far
2:10underneath my eyes I'm using the Catrice waterproof camouflage concealer
2:15i'm applying this underneath my eyes cover up them dark circles and i'm also
2:19applying this to my eyelids to prime for the eyeshadows and i'm just going to be
2:23blending that in with my Beauty Blender
2:36to set all that creaminess down I'm taking my RC may know color powder and
2:41i'm using this is sephora 47 brush to set my under eye concealer and pretty
2:46much set everywhere else
2:47I applied concealer as well i also took this wet and wild stippling brush and
2:54just dusted some of that powder on the rest of my face
2:57i'm going in with a bronzer that i have been loving so much ever since I tried
3:02it
3:02this is the to face sweetheart bronzer in the shade sweet tea
3:07i love it because it has a machinery site and Matt side and when you combine
3:10them you get a beautiful bronze glow
3:12i'm applying this with my way of a 90 brush one of the best bronzer brushes in
3:17my opinion
3:18love it so now i'm going to go ahead and start on my eyes I'm using the makeup
3:22eyeshadow and beaches and cream and i'm applying this into my crease with the
3:26morphe e23 brush and then i'm going in with makeup geek creme brulee and i'm
3:32also applying this into the crease but a little bit more precisely in the crease

4:02bedrock and i'm just using this eyeshadow to kind of blend out the edges
4:05of that blue and i'm going to take anastacio Beverly Hills eyeshadow in the
4:10shade farm with the same brush I'm using an e 28 by morphy and I'm just blending
4:15this into the crease so you get a nice gradient from the blue
4:19- like the warm brown here's what i'm talking about this eyeshadow looks
4:23stunning once you start applying it with your fingers
4:25I find that some color pop shadows do look great with a synthetic brush but
4:30this shape specifically apply with your fingers
4:32I'm taking this Luxy 229 brush remember dipping it into luckily and then buffing
4:38this into the crease
4:39this is just going to make everything blend better I went back into fond and

6:45you liked it please subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you in my
6:48next video bye
0:26hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on me make up i'm wearing right
0:31now this is the look I was wearing in my favorite makeup brushes video and it was
0:35highly requested it looks a little darker today for some reason i guess
0:39because my tee shirt is black and I was wearing very light colors that day
0:44somewhere then it looks a little darker but it's literally the exact same look I
0:48was wearing in that video
0:50so if you want to see a tutorial on the look I was going in the video then the
0:53routines
0:54i am using a bunch of random different eye shadows for this look but you can
0:57use whatever similar eyeshadows you have at home and it'll probably turn out
1:00pretty much the same so really quickly i want to mention because i know people
1:03are going to tell me i know this look is it like a daytime smokey eye this
1:07no this isn't for everybody this is probably way too much eye makeup for a
1:12lot of people and like I said on camera for some reason it looks a lot darker
1:16than what it looks like in person but it's not that serious guys it's just
1:20makeup and sometimes it's fun to be a little bold and edgy like right now all
1:24I'm missing is my guitar and got the look going on
1:28so anyway I just wanted to say that yeah it's not for everybody but some people
1:31like this look so I try to do different things for different people
1:35so if you want to see how to get this look just so the first thing I'm going
1:40to do is a prime my eyelids with Lorax behind the scenes eye primer and I'm
1:45going to take that all the way up to my brow bone then I'm going to take the
1:48color tattoo in pomegranate punk and it's this really pretty like cranberry
1:52purple and i'm going to apply this really close to my lash line
1:56I'm not even gonna put this like on my entire litter anything
2:01next I'm taking cork by mack on the fluffy blending brush and I'm just going
2:06to be applying this into my crease as my transition color
2:09I'm really not being specific with this I'm just leaven that all over my crease
2:13and i'm going to take a flat shader brush with this eyeshadow called
2:17Galapagos it's from NARS you can use any brown you want and i'm going to apply
2:21this to my entire bit
2:30by the way this look is going to look a little messy before it looks good it's
2:35one of those looks that you really have to blend a lot and then it turns out
2:39nice in the end
2:40now i'm just taking some of that cork I used earlier and i'm going to apply this
2:46into my crease with my - 17 and I'm just trying to blend these colors out a
2:50little bit more but we will go back to that and do some more blend and later on
2:54now i'm taking maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master it's just a
2:59nice dark black and I'm going to tight line with this and i'm also going to
3:02apply this to my waterline now with my mac 217 I'm gonna take this color called
3:09co-star it's from a two faced natural at night palette but honestly any dark warm
3:15chocolate color will work for this
3:18this was just my favorite so I'm applying that into my crease with my -
3:2217 and start blending away like i said this look requires lots and lots of
3:27blending
3:30yeah
3:34now i'm taking my gel eyeliner and i'm going to start smudging that on my upper
3:40lash line you don't want to be precise with this at all since we are going to
3:42be like smudging it away pretty much
3:45so you can be sloppy
3:49now with the tiny little brush I'm going to dip it into some black eyeshadow and
3:53then i'm going to use that to help smudge the gel eyeliner and i'm going to
3:58go back in with Galapagos and then i'm going to apply it on top just so that
4:02the black and blend into the brown a little bit more
4:08it's kind of like an ombre I don't want it to be like a black line and then
4:11Brown
4:12I wanted to fate now i'm going back into court and on my fluffy blending brush
4:16I'm going to start
4:18you guessed it blending
4:24at this point you just really really want to take your time and blend it and
4:28buff it this is the part that takes the longest just making sure that it looks
4:31kind of like it fades up and it's like a gradient from dark to a light brown
4:37now i'm just going to apply my mascara to my top lashes and then finish the
4:42rest of my face so that i can finish the bottom part of my eyes as my primary i'm
4:48using the Maybelline Baby skin instant poori racer
4:52when you have such dark colors on your eyes you want to make sure that you're
4:57using a full coverage foundation
4:59just like an look like it's a flawless and there's not a lot of redness because
5:03then it'll look like grungy and weird so i am using the Maybelline know the
5:08revlon colorstay with foundation and i am using this on a real techniques
5:16expert face brush to buff it all out
5:22yeah
5:26rendering my eyes I want something that's also a full coverage since the
5:30eyes are so dark and i'm using max pro longwear concealer everything that i'm
5:34using will be in the description box by the way if you are interested in what
5:38shade or whatever that will be down below
5:52and then I'm just going to set that with my msf natural
5:55I need one a little bit lighter I need to buy one but yeah now i'm going to
5:59take cork again and I'm going to use this on a pencil brush to smudge it
6:04underneath my eyes and then apply my mascara
6:06so for the rest of my face the bronzer i'm going to be using is NARS Laguna and
6:11I'm just gonna just pretty much bronze my whole face i'm not going to be too
6:14precise with this i'm not going to do like a strong contour anything
6:21yeah
6:26yeah
6:47for my blush I'm using Mac's margin and it's a really nice like pinky peach
6:52color I'm using this on the duo fiber brush because it doesn't deposit that
6:55much blush so I don't want something really strong i just want something to
7:00look like nice and pitching
7:02nice
7:09and then for my lips i am using Maybelline's blushing beige lipstick and

2:13I'm thinking support crease brush and I'm just buffing this into my crease so
2:18that all the eye shadows blend really nicely on top
2:21I'm gonna take the colour-pop eyeshadow in weenie and i'm applying this to my
2:28entire lid with my fingers

6:31i really hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching please
6:34subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video
6:37toodles
0:10ok so i felt a tutorial for the look i'm wearing right now
0:16it is like a bronzy but like a pinky bronzy look um I always do wings liner
0:24all the time either with gel or with liquid liner I just I've always done
0:28that but I did something a little bit different in this tutorial that haven't
0:33done in a while and i just i love how it turned out and I hope you guys do - okay
0:40so if you want to see how to get this look then please keep watching
0:44ok so I've already done my eyebrows and I heard this I eyebrows have not been
0:51cooperating with me lately
0:52so don't look at them ok so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
0:56take my Urban Decay primer potion this is just a little baby in the old
0:59packaging about this forever last pretty long time i would say and i'm just going
1:06to put this all over my lid
1:08all the way to the bone and then kind of run it on my lower lashes a little
1:14ok so the first of the two only eyeshadows i'm going to be using is
1:21called cork
1:22it's my mac and it's just like a just like a browns a really nice crease color
1:27and I'm taking on this fluffy brush this is a sigma e40 but any like really big
1:33fluffy brush will be fine and i am just going to work that into my crease
1:45I'm going to do it really lightly and just build up the color I'm going to go
1:48back and forth into this color cork and just build it up a little by little but
1:53i'm also going to be putting some of the color on the outer V just like rubbing
1:57it in and then bringing it into the crease
2:00ok so now it's my favorite part is the lid color and what I'm going to be using
2:07is max pigment and tan
2:09I have been obsessed with this I use this and everything and makes it with my
2:14bronzer to give like more glow to my face
2:17sometimes it actually was on my accent nail right here like my nail polish this
2:23color right here is just some of the ten pigment and then I put a clear top coat
2:29on it so I mean this is a multi-purpose little pigment any all the pigments on
2:36but i've been loving loving loving this color
2:40it's amazing so I'm just taking the top I'm like kind of mixing it and using
2:48whatever product is on the top so I'm just going to take my mac 239 brush and
2:55I'm just gonna pack this all over my entire life
3:08I'm going to take the same brush for the like this and kind of bring some into
3:13the crease just a tiny tiny bit like that like a tiny bit so I'm going to
3:20take my fix plus now i am going to spring my brush
3:26why it always freaks me out every time I swear that i'm going to dip it into the
3:31pigment and put this all over my lid again
3:35the fix plus really intensifies the shadow and gives it more like a metallic
3:41look
3:54and this is really just going on the lid I'm not bringing it into the crease at
3:59all
4:03ok so now I'm going to work on the lower lash line a little bit and I'm going to
4:06take the same brush kind of dry it off and i'm going to dip it into the pigment
4:12and I'm only picking up a little bit on the very tip of the brush like I'm not
4:18putting it on the actual brush like this it's just on the very tip I'm picking up
4:22a very small amount and i'm going to run that really close to my waterline
4:37now i'm just going to go back to my fluffy brush and back to that cork
4:41eyeshadow that we use in the crease and I'm going to do the same thing like the
4:47first step i did i'm going to do it all over again
4:49not so much though just going to try to blend this out a little more and bring
4:56some depth to the other be
5:04ok I know it seems like a lot of steps but it's really quickly when you're
5:07doing it on your own it's literally two eyeshadows
5:10it's just that I'm trying to explain it but really if you're doing this on your
5:14own it's your done in a second
5:17now i'm just taking a pencil brush
5:20this is a sigma e30 and I'm gonna dip it back
5:25Oh different right back into this cork color and we're gonna blend out the tan
5:32pigment on the lower lash line
5:40this part takes a little bit of time you just have to sit there and kind of blend
5:45so it looks nice and smoked out
5:54ok so once I've done that I'm just going to line my waterline i am using brown
5:59because i don't want it to be super harsh i don't want to be like very black
6:04I like this to look a little chocolaty and bronzy from any sense
6:09so I'm using the keyless much stick waterproof eyeliner in damsel
6:15this comes in the ELA in the light palette it's like the most beautiful
6:18chocolate brown color and it stays on your waterline all day so I'm just going
6:24to line my waterline with this and then i'm going to tight line as well
6:35ok so now i am going to do this little smoked out eyeliner
6:41so basically I'm just going to be drawing a line right here like if I were
6:44doing a liquid liner or something but pretty sloppy because it doesn't matter
6:52you I'm going to be blending that out in a second
7:06this drives pretty quickly so I've got to work quickly
7:10I'm just going to take this this is an eyebrow brush that I got from coastal
7:15sense but i use it like some gel eyeliner it's amazing for that
7:19so now i'm just gonna smoke this out
7:29just want to go back and forth until it's pretty smoked out and it kind of
7:32blends in with that tan pigment
7:34ok so now that i'm done blending this is what it looks like it's kind of like a
7:38diffused liner and it's a lot more natural than having a gay black liquid
7:44liner or don't line or something like that
7:47ok so now we're going to kind of do the same thing on the lower lash line
7:50only I'm not adding any more eyeliner I'm just gonna kind of smudge what's
7:55already there so I'm just going to start blending this
7:58oh I'm using a pencil brush and stead of this one because this one can be a
8:04little harsh for your under eyes I'm using a pencil brush
8:08I'm getting really close to the water line that time smudging it down kind of
8:18ok so for my brow bone highlight and like my inner corner highlight
8:22I'm just going to take like a cream colored shadow I don't want anything
8:25shimmery since there's so much sugar on the lids
8:28you can if you're doing this look you can go ahead and do something humor if
8:30you want to tweet you don't I just don't like to have something so shimmery under
8:35my brow bone when I have something should be on the lips ok so i'm just
8:39going to take my while Danny pallets color right here
8:42I don't know what it's called they know they sell this color separately when a
8:45while sell it separate e and if you find it i really suggest you get it's like
8:50the best most pigmented cream-colored highlight color
8:56yeah so I'm just going to take this on my pencil brush and put this
9:00underneath my eyebrow and I'm going to take it into my
9:07- your duck as well
9:16and now i'm just going to add my mascara i am using my clinic / doubling mascara
9:22for my top lashes and i'm using my illegal length by Maybelline mascara on
9:29my bottom lashes and i will be right back okay
9:33and this is the finished
9:36I look I personally love it
9:40and now i'm going to move to my face ok so for the face i'm going to keep it
9:45pretty simple not going to do anything crazy at all
9:47i have already primed right face with the team relief powder job and I kind of
9:54touched up some little pimple areas i put some concealer over them and to do
10:00that i use the gabby consider I got in my ofc bag last month
10:04ok so you guys are actually going to witness me using the Beauty Blender for
10:10the very first time
10:11as you can see it's like bright neon kind of hurts your eyes a little bit
10:14because i have never used it before it's been like to know
10:21yeah it's like two weeks since i bought it and i haven't used it yet i don't
10:23know why i guess because I don't want to do it and that's really sweet but i
10:27gotta just wait for the first time right now and like I felt to expand in the
10:32palm of my hand and I thought
10:33it was the coolest thing I don't know that anybody else experience that when
10:37different about this
10:38it's literally like this big and came out this big but it's tiny and then it
10:43just like expands in your hand when you like switching the water out it's so
10:49cool to me oh no you know that's really dorky but I found that really cool
10:54ok so I'm going to see how well this works so this is kind of like my first
10:58impressions on it
10:59in this tutorial so i'm going to be using my L'Oreal True Match Lumi i have
11:04come to the conclusion that this is my holy grail foundation after my black
11:09colors day
11:10they're kind of tied I want this stuff is amazing i love it the more i use this
11:17the more I hate my trouble on your naked foundation but anyway so i guess i'm
11:21just going to bounce this into my foundation put this on my face
11:40yeah
11:44this is fun
11:46for some reason I camera this kind of looks like it's a little too dark for me
11:49but this
11:52I don't know why looks like that on camera doesn't look like that in my
11:57mirror
11:58that's it for me
12:05this is awesome because story
12:13whenever I use like my foundation brush which might like amazing holy grail
12:17foundation brush is the Sigma angled kabuki the f-84 and love that not even
12:26my real techniques expert face brush is as good as that one and i thought it
12:30would be but it isn't but you have to sit there and kind of blend it for a
12:35while this kind of just puts on your foundation perfectly like perfectly
12:50and I feel like it doesn't drink up a lot of the product either like you know
12:54like those little cheap triangle sponges that you get like a target the stuff I
12:59used for my foundation on with that all the time when I was younger and that
13:03like just drank up the liquid and it's crazy that this one doesn't because it's
13:08a sponge
13:09well I guess the when you are dampen it kind of let that happen but ok so this
13:17little guy is amazing and i don't know if you can tell but i feel like when i
13:21use this sponge as opposed to my brush gives me more like a dewy finish this is
13:27a foundation that gives you a new we finish but I feel like with my brush my
13:31stuff it in
13:32I don't get like the dizziness of the foundation I mean not really
13:36not as much as this I don't know if you can see it like my face is glowing over
13:39here
13:40I don't know i love this but the real test
13:44i'm going to put to the test right now is how well it blends out my consider
13:48underneath my eyes cuts
13:52that's what's important to me so pumped a tiny bit of my mac pro longwear
13:58concealer on the back of my hand and I
14:03to pop this and like a triangle shape
14:08ok oh I'm in the shade and w 15 mile away you're wondering
14:12okay let's see
14:28ok so my memory card got full so i had to go take the memory card output in the
14:36computer
14:37that's how I know that this video is probably way too long because my memory
14:41card never gets full before i finish filming it usually gets fully when I'm
14:48done you know
14:49so right
14:52so yeah well i was uploading the footage footage
14:57yeah I guess you were calling footage into my computer i set my under eye
15:01concealer with my msf natural in mediums my favorite place ever
15:09but yeah I think you blend it out amazingly like just like flawlessly like
15:16this
15:16honestly it's flawless its twenty dollars it's crazy but I think that it
15:22just applies your makeup amazing right it doesn't look on my forehead
15:26it doesn't look like a foundation on that's insane
15:30ok so like i said earlier I'm not gonna do anything crazy to my face and my dark
15:35like the Sun comes and goes and
15:38that's what sets of our natural lighting just like whatever mother nature wants
15:42to piss you off at will
15:45so I'm gonna take my contouring blush and bronzing powder i have been loving
15:49this
15:50I'm recently I like it a lot more for the summer because i know this is a
15:55pretty deep

1:47this look is using my morphe 35o palette
1:51this was also so requested a lot of you guys were like why haven't you both
1:55Cesaro using that and it's just because it's so constantly out of stock i don't
1:58like to upset anyone
1:59but i did use that palette for this look today
2:03it's a very messy brown smokey eye so anyone can do this look absolutely
2:08anyone it's just really just a messy brown smokey eye
2:12nothing too fancy or too complicated so i feel like i've been talking for like
2:1610 minutes already
2:17if you want to see how to get this makeup look right here then just keep
2:21watching
2:22ok so I am jumping into eyeshadow since my eyes are already primed
2:27I'm taking this really light warm shade in the palette I hate that none of these
2:32have names but I mean the entire palette is warm and full of orange colors but
2:37i'm just taking a light shade in the palette and using this in my crease
2:42now i'm taking this dark matte Brown this brown has a lot of red to it so
2:47it's like a very reddish brown and i'm applying this on my entire lid
2:56yeah
2:57I'm going to go into this mid tone brown shade and on a small little crease brush
3:02I am just applying that into my crease just so that I can blend those brown
3:07colors together
3:10now i'm going to take a darker brown
3:14this one isn't as red as the 1i used before and it's a little bit deeper
3:18so on a flat shader brush I am just applying this to my entire lid just to
3:22deepen up the look i wanted something a little bit darker now I'm going to take
3:27this orange color and on that same little crease brush we used earlier i am
3:32applying this into my crease to really really warm up the look i wanted the
3:37crease to look like very orangie so that as well as it and then I just took a big
3:43fluffy brush just to blend out any harsh edges
3:47I took this shimmery like light champagne pinky shade and i applied this
3:54underneath my brow bone to highlight now i'm taking a black eyeliner this one is
4:00from nicks it's their specially like saying that or attempting to say that
4:07and I tight line with this and then I applied it really close to my lashes and
4:12smudged it out with a pencil brush you can use winged eyeliner but i wanted
4:16something a little bit more messy and smudge looking and then I just went
4:20right back into that deep matte brown shade and applied applied it to my lid
4:25all over again
4:28okay i'm going to take this like neon peach shade and i'm going to lightly
4:34dust this into my crease and this is really going to make it look
4:39go from zero to a hundred in terms of warmth it's really gonna warm things up
4:43so i'm going to move on to the rest of my face before I finish up my eyes as I
4:47usually do and i'm using the Maybelline Baby skin
4:51Oh taking a sip of my sparkling water but I use my baby skin and support your
4:57acer as a primer and then i'm using the Makeup Forever HD stick foundation i'm
5:02going to give you guys a quick little review because you guys wanted to know
5:05my thoughts on this
5:06I love this it's amazing this is like the first stick foundation that actually
5:11works for dry skin believe it or not because it does have like a very sat in
5:15natural finish a lot of people say it's like a dewy finish but I find it a
5:19little bit more at least on my dry skin
5:21it's not as doing it's a little bit more like natural and this color is a shade
5:26too dark for me I've gotten very fair / you know the past few weeks but it is a
5:33little bit too dark for me but let's try to look past it i'm going to take my
5:39Maybelline fit me concealer in 15 fair and i'm applying this underneath my eyes
5:44not only to hide my dark circles but to highlight my face and I'm also
5:49highlighting other parts of my face as well
5:54i'm blending all that in with my Real Techniques contour brush
6:09and of course to make sure that my concealer does increase
6:12I'm setting it with my NYX HD powder in the shade button up
6:17banana mama mama
6:23ok so to finish off the eyes i'm taking this next eyeliner in the shade golden
6:28bronze and i just use that on my waterline and then I took that same
6:33crease shade we used in the beginning of the tutorial well I'm going really fast
6:37and I just blended that under my lower lash line and then i just use the same
6:42highlight shade under my brow bone on my inner corners
6:45ok ok so this shadow is magical it's one of the new kat von d eyeshadows
6:51it's amazing it's in the shade dose go say it's amazing
6:56so I just blended that underneath my lower lashes and then I took that same
6:59matt brown and I just deepen out the outer corner with that
7:03so I wanted like a metallic green e gold
7:07so I went into my uh Nastasia world travel a pallet traveler palette and i
7:12took the shade metallic and I applied it to my lower lash line and my inner tear
7:17duct and a little bit on my top lid as well and i just put on some clinic
7:21mascara and I was going to apply falsies but I i kind of like to look without
7:27policies but you know you do whatever you want
7:31so to contour my face i'm using my physicians formula bronzer in the shade
7:36medium
7:39I think it's the bronze booster bronzer and I think it's the medium shade so I'm
7:44just contouring with this but not like a very harsh contour anything
7:48mainly just warming up my face and also trying to add some runs onto my neck
7:53since my face didn't quite match my neck all that much so I took off my little
7:57heart ears and i'm applying some highlight this is the echo champagne pop
8:03highlighter and i'm highlighting my face and I decided to highlight before blush
8:07today and I don't know why
8:08so I went into this elf palette this is the light blush palette and i took the
8:13really warm
8:14pinchy pinchy No peachy shade and I just decided to stamp that on my face and of
8:20course finishing off the look with the
8:23Miami fever liquid lipstick that completes this makeup look thank you
8:26guys so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you
8:30haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:24no he isn't hey guys so let me address something really quick
0:31my dad decided to play his guitar right when I want to sit down and film the
0:37intro of this video and let's try to look past that
0:51ok so the music didn't stop
0:55so hey guys and this is gonna be a voiceover intro
0:59I wanted to say a couple of things so today's video is going to be a drugstore
1:04makeup tutorial a full-face drugstore makeup tutorial on this look right here
1:08I wanted to do something really really easy like for beginners simple every
1:12single day type of thing
1:13so this is what I came up with i am using the wet and wild pilot in no
1:18filter i believe this is what it's called it's from the fergie line and
1:22mainly using that bronzy pink color which by the way is really similar to
1:25max tan pigment just saying
1:29oh and my brows I want to touch base on them really quickly i use my elf eyebrow
1:34kit so i did use something from the drug store as well
1:37only I didn't film it because I take forever to do my brows and I like this
1:41but I think it makes my brows just a little bit darker than I'd like
1:44I really like bold eyebrows and you guys know it but i like it to come off a
1:48little bit more warm and not as dark as this but I use this from time to time
1:52and yeah I just wanted to tell you guys that so that you don't comment down
1:57below like a eyebrows are scary
1:59I know guys I know so yeah like I said this look is super easy anybody can do
2:05it
2:05I mean it's really really simple and so if you want to see how to get this
2:09drugstore makeup look then just keep watching
2:12so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my milani brow
2:16I highlighter and i'm going to use the matte side and i'm going to apply this
2:19underneath my eyebrows
2:21and just blend it out with my fingers and then add this to the inner part of
2:25my eye as well
2:33next I'm taking my maybelline color tattoo in the shade barely branded and
2:37i'm going to use this to prime my eyes and use it as a base for the eyeshadow
2:41i'm going to put down
2:43yeah
2:49I'm going to line my waterline and my tight line with Maybelline master drama
2:53eyeliner in midnight master as per usual
2:57the eyeshadow i'm going to be using is from this one and wild palette and I'm
3:00using that pinky bronze color of the corner and i'm going to wet my brush
3:04with 6 plus before I dip it into the eye shadow just to intensify it a bit and
3:09then I'm just going to pack this all over my lid
3:27to blend out the harsh lines i'm going to take this matt brown from this next
3:30love in Paris palette because the brown in the wedding on a pallet is too dark
3:35for the crease so I'm going to take that on a mac 217 and just blend out the
3:39edges
3:41this look is pretty simple and soft so I don't want to go too crazy with anything
3:46in the crease
3:47next I'm going to take this lighter shade in the palette and I'm going to
3:51use this to highlight underneath my brow bone this color isn't very pigmented
3:55it's the only one in the palette that doesn't have a lot of pigment to it
3:58which is why i put down that milani base first
4:02next I'm going to take my jordana fabric liner in black and I'm just going to add
4:06a little wing not to sin or not too thick or anything like that
4:09I got too close to the mirror and then I got out of focus because i wasn't paying
4:12attention development focus or not
4:14so yeah you don't have to add a wing but i just wanted to i'm going in with my
4:19L'Oreal voluminous carbon black mascara and my Maybelline the rocket volume
4:22right on top
4:23I'm going to move on to the rest of my face and I'm using my heart candy sheer
4:28envy primer to prime my face
4:32yeah
4:38the foundation I'm using is my revlon colorstay foundation in 250 medium beige
4:44i want to say i haven't it in the description box but i think it's 250
4:48I kept smelling my foundation because i just realized how good this foundation
4:52smells and I never noticed it no yeah that's why i'm selling my lunch but i'm
4:57using this on my Real Techniques sponge
5:01and it looks like i'm stamping my face pretty hard but I'm not just the fast
5:08forward effect that I guess
5:15then I'm going to go in with my Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
5:1715 fair and i'm going to use this to cover up my dark circles and highlight
5:23underneath my eyes a little bit
5:27I'm going to blend that out with my ELF pointed foundation brush
5:36to set that I'm going to use my Maybelline fit me powder in 135 creamy
5:40natural and i'm just going to use this to set my concealer underneath my eyes
5:44to prevent it from creasing and I didn't get a lot of sleep that night
5:50so all the night before so my dark circles were pretty bad even with
5:53concealer over them
5:54let's just ignore that I'm going to take the dark brown and be wet and wild
5:58palette and on a tiny little brush I'm going to smudge this really really close
6:02to my waterline
6:09then with a pencil brush I'm going to go back into that color we used in our
6:12crease and i'm just going to blend out the dark brown just so that it looks
6:16nice and blended and smoked out
6:21I'm going to move on to the rest of my face i'm using my physicians formula
6:25bronze booster and i'm just going to bronze up my face a little bit like I
6:29said this is a really simple day-to-day look so I don't want to contour anything
6:32like that i'm using my ELF complexion brush
6:35I believe that's what it's called I'm just gonna warm up my skin a little bit
6:38take it on my neck and all that jazz
6:45and then I realized
6:47I didn't put mascara on my bottom lashes so yeah anyway I'm going to move on to
6:52my blush i love this blush this is from pixie and it's called healthiest honey
6:56and it's just like a warm peach it's really really pretty i love it just like
7:00from day to day because it gives some warmth to my cheeks actually got this
7:03blush I'm marshals for like two dollars which I no pixie is pretty expensive at
7:07target so I love this blush
7:09moving on to my lips i am using my revlon matt baume in the color elusive
7:14and i'm just going to put a light layer of this all over my lips and then i'm
7:17going to top it off with a lip gloss and i am using the NYX butter gloss and
7:21fortune cookie
7:21just to lighten it up a little bit I thought it was a little bit too pink
7:25so this is just making it more milkier version of that color and that is it
7:30that is the end of this really simple fast day-to-day drugstore tutorial i
7:34really hope you enjoyed this look
7:36thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
7:38will see you in my next video

0:27my breath on the island i'm wearing
0:31I didn't record myself doing my foundation and my concealer and my
0:34powder because i feel like i do that in every video and it's always the same
0:38thing so i skipped that I just did my bronzer my blush my highlight and my
0:42lips
0:43this is save a little bit more time I want to mainly focus this look around
0:46these eyes
0:48so that's what I'm doing today I really hope you enjoyed this video and that you
0:52really like this
0:53I makeup I really do I think it's a nice and a smoky and it sexy i like it very
0:58much
0:59so you want to see how to get this I look then just keep watching
1:02so as usual the first thing I'm doing is priming mad
1:06Mellie girls pro conceal i really love using this concealer to prime my eyelids
1:10because it stays in place all day and it does increase on me
1:13so that's why I'm using this is the Sonia Kashuk I am neutral palette and
1:17I'm like being this palette to death and I've used it and like all of my recent
1:20tutorials but it's really good
1:22I'm taking this cream color shade it's really close to my skin tone and i'm
1:26using this to put all over my I up to my brow bone to set that concealer
1:30I'm going to take this really warm or reddish kind of brown there's a lot of
1:34red to this
1:35Oh what I don't know ok and i am using this as my transition shade this shade
1:40is really important for the other channels we were putting down and it
1:44does take a little bit of building i have to work with this eyeshadow a
1:47little bit because it's not as creamy as the rest of them but once you do you get
1:51a nice reddish brown color
1:53now i'm gonna take this eyeshadow from colour-pop it's called mittens
1:58it's a really really like reddish deep kind of brown
2:02I'm singing throughout this whole video I was feeling my playlist
2:06anyway i'm applying this my entire lid i love this color
2:09it's so gorgeous so i'm applying this all the way up to my crease not really
2:14passing my crease so much just applying it as an all over the lid shade
2:19I'm going to go back into that Brown that reddish brown from the palette and
2:24I'm going to start to blend this color this part takes a long time it's like a
2:28process because we are
2:30I'm trying to mix these two colors really well and blend them together
2:33nicely so just go back and forth it just takes a while but it you get there
2:37eventually
2:38I'm taking grandstand from the new mega be spoiled eyeshadows it's amazing as
2:43you can see by my reaction and on a flat shader brush I'm going to apply this
2:47mainly to the center of my lid like a right
2:50dab in the middle so that a lot of light can reflect to that part of the eye and
2:55i'm going to start applying and animals are blending it into the mittens color a
2:59little bit just working my brush around so that it's not just a stark line of
3:04that color does that make sense
3:05you see me you see me you see me working at mainly in the center of the lid going
3:09back into mittens i'm just going to deepen out the outer part of my eyelid
3:13and my crease a little bit and then freaking out because I think the UPS man
3:19was there for me anyway
3:21and then I'm going to keep it out the inner corner as well i kind of want to
3:24keep the main focus of the grandstand I title right in the center as you can
3:30you said it a million times going right back into that reddish brown and i'm
3:35just going to further blend everything out some more take your time with this
3:38and kind of blend everything together
3:40I'm going to take this cream color again and i'm going to apply this underneath
3:44my brow bone and i'm also going to apply this to the inner part of my eye as well
3:49and then to further highlight because that doesn't give me enough i like I'm
3:55going to go into the white eyeshadow with this tiny little crease brush from
3:59makeup geek and i'm going to apply this the high points of my eyebrows to
4:02highlight and right in my energy reduction as well

4:23pretty and love it this is a tiny crease brush from makeup geek but i use it as a
4:29pencil brush with tiny this is max poster reach
4:32I cool and i am applying this to my waterline and my timeline as well it's a
4:36very very red brown like it's very warm very red
4:41it's a brown but it's a lot of bread to it I'm going to go back into this grants

6:18mountainous and Ron -

1:26keep saying this but I know you guys requested the look that was wearing in
1:29that video like in my makeup geek video and I tried to recreate it last night
1:33and it was totally off
1:36I remember the eyeshadows I used but i don't remember how like I place them and
1:41stuff like that so it didn't look the same
1:44that's why there wasn't a video wednesday morning like midnight when I
1:48usually post because that video did not turn out the way it was supposed to but
1:52yeah I will try again try anyway side no I know that some of you are like how
1:59come you're bloops are not all your videos and stuff like that sometimes I
2:04don't have bloopers like sometimes things go smoothly and I don't have
2:08bloopers and I don't want to make up bloopers I don't want to sit there and
2:11pretend like i have a bunch of bloopers when I don't so I only adds the loops
2:15when the books happen sometimes the balloons don't happen but yeah anyway
2:20I'm rambling at this point I know this is very me this is very warm i do looks
2:25like this all the time where you do the same looks at the time
2:28but it was requested to use this palette and this palette is very warm so that's
2:34why it's another war my shadow we look because using the palette that was
2:38requested to use so don't be mad at me i'm going to be posting like a silver
2:43black smokey eye soon lot more cooler tones looks and i keep saying that but
2:48seriously there in the works anyway if you want to see how to get this suit
2:52just keep watching
2:55ok so you guys know i always start off with my eyebrows already painted have an
3:00eyebrow tutorial on my channel if you're interested but the first thing I'm doing
3:03is I'm going to prime my eyelids and i am using the LA girls pro primer you can
3:09get la girls at drugstore.com i love this primer it's actually really good
3:13and it masks the veins on my eyelids i'm going to take the vegas light palette
3:17and the first I should i am using is desert sands it's probably one of my
3:22favorite colors in this palette it's beautiful it's like vomity kind of brown
3:27it's amazing so I'm just adding that color into my crease kind of like a
3:31transition shade but I'm i was pretty much putting it everywhere i'm taking
3:35this eyeshadow called roulette and then I get excited because so pigmented like
3:41it's crazy pigmented roulette is a beautiful like reddish copper ii
3:45burgundy and no it's gorgeous and I'm using my ELF one-dollar brush which is
3:50actually pretty good if you ask me
3:52so I'm just packing that on my entire lid right up to the crease then I'm
3:57going to take this fluffy brush the same morphe brush and I'm dipping it back
4:02into that desert sand color and I'm gonna rub this back and forth into my
4:07crease and what this is
4:08gonna do is gonna blend the roulette shade and kind of help it melt into the
4:12desert sand shades a little bit now this look doesn't require fix+ but i just
4:17wanted to add just a little bit to intensify it just a little bit more this
4:21eyeshadow is very pigmented on its own but i just added a little bit of fix
4:25plus a little bit of pizzazz then with this Ecotools brush I'm taking me fluffy
4:32side because it's a dual ended brush and I'm going to dip it right back into
4:36desert sands and I'm just gonna start packing this into my crease i'm using a
4:40smaller crease brush to make it a little bit more precise in the crease i'm going
4:44to take mirage and this is gonna be my brow bone highlight this color is so
4:49pigmented i love it and I'm going to take a little wipe and I'm going to
4:53clean up the edges like I usually do make it a little bit sharp at the edges
4:58you can always use tape but I just clean it
5:01I'm gonna take this Stila eyeliner in the shape damn so i believe and I'm
5:05going to tight line with this and I'm going to use this as my water on my
5:08waterline as well this is just a brown eyeliner then I'm going to take the
5:13pigment called liquid gold this is also from makeup geek this is a super intense
5:18green gold pigment like really intense and I'm gonna put in my inner corner
5:23kind of like any little triangle shape and make it look sharp does that make
5:27sense
5:28well you see it's like a little triangle and then I'm gonna add a link to the
5:32outer part of my I kind of like where you would normally put eyeliner just a
5:37little bit different i guess that makes sense i'm never good at explaining but
5:41you can see here huh i'm going to take my Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner and
5:45just add a little flick you guys know every time I try to do an eyeliner
5:50on-camera I get way too close to the mirror and get a frame but here I'm just
5:55priming my face before I finish up my eyes and I'm using my cover effects
5:59calming primary to do that then I'm gonna put on some foundation and i

6:30age rewind dark circle eraser in the shade fair and i'm just adding like that
6:34triangle-shaped highlight as well to further highlight i am taking the
6:38Maybelline magic Lumi pen
6:41I believe that's what is called magic Lumi pen and i'm just going to highlight
6:44my face even more on my nose my forehead around my mouth you know the places
6:49where you would normally highlight and then I'm just gonna blend that out with
6:54the same foundation brush
7:02I'm actually gonna take this product here this is the NARS contour powder in
7:06Paloma it also comes with a highlight shade that's completely matte so I'm
7:10going to take that highlight shade and i'm going to set my under eye concealer
7:12with this thank you to everyone who said that this brush was perfect for setting
7:17my under eye concealer because I was like oh I don't like this brushes too

2:05I've had since I was like ten
2:07there we go and i'm going to start on my eyes I'm using the Jessie's Girl
2:11eyeshadow primer one of my favorite drugstore primers i would say i got it
2:15at Jessie's Girl cosmetics com
2:17now i'm going to take this la girl LA girl Pro prime
2:21this is like a skin tone color well my skin tone a little bit like it and i'm
2:26just using this to cover up all the veins on my eyelids and act as a base
2:30but i do need to set that base
2:32so I'm taking this little lorac Pro matte palette and I'm using the one of
2:36the shade closest to my skin tone to set that base so that there are no tackiness
2:42when I apply the eyeshadows
2:43ok so I'm taking this first color in the palette and I'm using a fluffy brush and
2:48I'm applying this to my crease these colors in the palette don't have names
2:53so you're just gonna go buy me pointing that pointing at them because they don't
2:57have specific names i'm so sorry that's going to get a little confusing
3:00I'm taking this color which is under it it's a little bit more brownish not as
3:04purple and i'm just going to do the same thing I just like the mixture of those
3:08two colors a more mom anymore brown just to act as my transition shade
3:14now i'm going to take this elf brush and dip it into the top corner
3:19eyeshadow this is going to be the all over lid shade
3:22this is such a pigmented shade usually i would go in with a mac fix+ but it
3:26doesn't even need it
3:27it's metallic it's stunning I love it so much it's a nice burgundy color
3:32now i'm taking this brown shade
3:34and a skinnier priest brush and just blending everything together so that
3:39there are no harsh lines and then taking a fluffy brush and just further blending
3:44now this is matt reddish burgundy shade
3:50I love this color I'm taking that same crease brush that I used earlier is it
3:55the same one
3:55well it's like a fat pencil brush and I am just focusing this in the crease and
4:01bringing it to the inner corners as well so on the outer corner and the inner
4:05corner
4:05kind of like a halo look but not really then going back into that fluffy brush
4:10by the way this from sephora i am just blending everything out
4:14you know you know blending Oh going back into that shade we use on the lid and i
4:20just applied some more to intensify it a little then I took that golden shade and
4:24added it to the inner corners and I'm taking this la girl deep bronze eyeliner
4:30and I'm tight lining with this then I'm going to add a wing this is the Jessie's
4:34Girl liquid liner and i'm adding the wing and i always start off with little
4:40strokes and then do the tail but I like I get way too close to the camera and
4:43then you can see me and I'm a total failure i'm so sorry
4:46so let's move on to the face before I finish my eyes I'm just
4:49I was laughing so hard editing this because I look so we're doing that with
4:54my arm but I just spritz the josie maran Nirvana treatment missed on my face and
5:00then i went in with the laura mercier radiance primer so for foundation I'm
5:05using the new to face born this way i'm in warm nude
5:09I love this foundation it gives you a supernatural finish not too mad not do
5:15we either it's just a nice natural finish and it has pretty good coverage
5:20that's my mini review of any of you guys were wondering i really really like it
5:24but I mean I love everything to face makes don't I know it
5:30now i'm taking this like peachy Sammy shade concealer by pixie and i'm
5:36applying that underneath my eyes to help with my dark circles and then I'm gonna
5:40go in with concealer right on top of it
5:43so my concealer is the Maybelline better skin I can't stop using it's just so
5:47easy to blend so lightweight so i'm applying that underneath my eyes to
5:53cover up as well but also to highlight the face so that i'm going to apply it
5:56to other parts of my face to continue to highlight and then look what happens
6:00look my camera got foggy I don't understand how that happened or why and
6:04it's only like in the center because if you see the background it's not very
6:07foggy it's so weird
6:09the camera about foggy i'm using the sedona least 217 brush to blend
6:13everything out
6:15it does say foggy for a little bit longer but only for like a couple
6:18minutes and then it goes back to normal
6:20so I'm sorry so to set my under eye can see there i'm using the NYX HD setting
6:25powder in the shade banana
6:26this is a real techniques setting brush and it's good at setting
6:30let me tell you this is the charlotte tilbury micro smooth powder and i'm just
6:35going to put this on my face
6:37- not really mattify but so that there is no tackiness when I go in with my
6:43bronzer
6:49ok so bronzer of choice i'm using this laguna NARS Laguna bronzer
6:53this is like a limited edition one that came with this tiny to brush and let me
6:57just tell you I love Laguna it's one of my favorite bronzers but this video
7:01brush is not worth the money and a lot of people are like oh it's because that
7:04one short but the big one is worth the money no it sheds like crazy it sheds
7:09like crazy guys it's not worth it don't spend your money on it it's really not
7:13worth it
7:14I I least I don't think so and then I just blend everything out with my Real
7:17Techniques multitask brush so going back to the eyes the fogginess is gone
7:22I just added that same eyeliner to my waterline the one I use to tight line
7:26and then I'm taking that Matt reddish burgundy shade to smoke out the lower
7:32lash line and then a more neutral brown color on the pencil brush and just
7:36really blend everything out so far mascara I'm using my clinic lash
7:41doubling but then i'm going to go in with falsies
7:43these are the ardell demi wispies falsies
7:47and yes that is what I did for my eyes and my eyes are complete
7:50I wanted my skin to look a little bit more luminous not so flat so i took this
7:55one wild bronzer in in in the Cabana
8:02it will be listed below i forgot the name but it is not a bronzer obviously
8:07clearly it just gives it it's like a face powder that gives a nice subtle
8:10Sheen very similar to the hourglass ambient lighting powders for blush this
8:16is nicks mom I was going to say mocha what is wrong with me today okay this is
8:22the NYX blush in the shade moth and i'm using a morphe brush to apply that to
8:26mush eeks for highlight I'm using an oldie but a goodie this is max soft and
8:32gentle every time you use it I'm like huh
8:34why don't you see you every day and then I put it back and I don't use it for a
8:37while
8:37I don't know it's really really pretty you know you can't go wrong with Max
8:41soft and gentle
8:43so for lips I cannot get enough of these over a liquid lipsticks i'm sorry i love
8:47them
8:48this one is in the shade pasadena so I'm just putting that on my entire lips
8:52usually I would just go ahead and do a nude like a bear nude with this look but

1:53and just give up watching oh I'm fixing my setup i'll talk about it later but
1:59i'm trying to get my old setup like back in Mississippi back in my life so I'm
2:03working on it
2:04we have you want to get this look then just keep watching so I'm going to prime
2:08my eyelids using the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer you can get this i have
2:13an H you can get this at Jessie's Girl cosmetics that come that's where i
2:17bought it and i really love this primer super shape so we're good
2:23like I mentioned before these color pop eyeshadows are best applied either with
2:31your hands or with a synthetic brush I'm going to take this brush and I got this
2:37in an Ipsy bag or a box each arm kinda remember right now and I don't know
2:42where it's from and just as modern minerals you are gorgeous and I'm going
2:46to go ahead and take the eyeshadow in the shade glow and i'm going to apply
2:51this underneath my brow bone
2:54like i said in my review or like not my review but like i said in my previous
2:59video where I'm talking about these eyeshadows this color obviously is not
3:03going to be a highlight for every skin tone as you can see but again I explains
3:07it in that video i wanted to do a really like cream shade and
3:11I wanted to do a color that they didn't already have so this is what we are
3:14working with
3:15I'm sorry if you have darker skin you definitely can mix it with the map tan
3:19shade and get the perfect highlight color but anyway i'm just applying on
3:24underneath my brow bone
3:26I think you guys and I didn't realize how far you guys were so next I'm going
3:31to take a synthetic brush another synthetic brush like this
3:34this is these away but concealer buffer 142 brush and the way the review is
3:39coming soon I know I keep saying that but it's coming soon
3:42I'm going to take this shade right here called Cornelius it's a very warm
3:47pinky brownie caramely latte color yeah and i'm going to start applying this
3:54into my crease
4:11then I'm going to go in with this shade right here which is called
4:15kathleenlights my favorite one and i'm just going to dip my finger into this
4:21one this one is definitely one that you want to use your finger with cause it
4:26just applies better but look at that
4:28pigmentation good you faint because I good
4:43so I'm just going to apply that to my entire lid like literally everywhere
4:48I'm going to go back into this smaller brush and I'm going to dip it into
4:52kathleenlights again it's so weird
4:54referring it to company lives so strange but i'm going to run that right here
5:09taking this one next this one is blaze this one is so beautiful all over the
5:13lid as well
5:15or like you can take a brush like this and pack it on the outer corners and
5:19that would be really pretty too but I just I love this all over the world and
5:23on this same brush I'm going to run that underneath my lower lash line
5:35and I'm going to bring it all the way in so I can kind of diffuse the gold a
5:40little bit
5:46this one has a lot of glitter to it like a lot of sparkle to it so it's really
5:50really fun to play with
5:52as opposed to the orange e-gold that's more of a sheen then with that same
5:57brush I'm going to take Cornelius and I am going to run that underneath my lower
6:05lash line just to help blend everything together
6:13I'm gonna take prettiest one more time and i'm just going to intensify the
6:17crease a bit
6:19so back into this so Eva concealer brush and just apply some more to my crease
6:27I love this eyeshadow all over the lid by itself like just for an everyday look
6:33love it okay next I'm going to use some eyeliner I'm going to use my favorite
6:38Brown eyeliner
6:39this is the NYX jumbo pencil liner in the shade of brown and i'm going to
6:46tight line with this and apply it to my waterline as well now i'm just taking
6:51some on the top lash line
6:56I i started doing it and completely forgot to explain it so I'm just taking
6:59some of this is a very creamy delicious eyeliner it's great to smudge out
7:05because it gives you the chance to smudge it out because it's not stiff and
7:08dry so I'm just applying it as if I were applying eyeliner really really close to
7:16my lashes and I'm going to take that same rush we've been using and the
7:21smudge it out
7:23Oh
7:28since I want this look to be really messy and like bronzy I don't want to do
7:33a really professional crisp eyeliner
7:35I want something messy and I think it looks really nice
7:40ok so for my inner corners I actually want something sparkly not mad I'm just
7:46going to take one of the colour-pop highlighters
7:49these are going to be coming out very very soon not exactly sure when the
7:53launch date is but very soon and I'm going to take lunch money
7:56it's a beautiful it's probably my favorite one to be honest out of all of
7:59them
8:00it's a beautiful like white gold or renting a lot of moonstone from becca
8:05and i'm just going to play that run in here to finish off the eyes i'm going to
8:15apply some mascara so I'm going to chrome it curl my lashes first
8:24i'm going to apply my estee lauder little black primer all over my lashes
8:29then i'm going to apply Maybelline lash sensational lash sensational
8:36right on top and then for my bottom lashes my clinic bottom lash and i will
8:39be right back
8:40ok so once you put on mascara as you can see it kind of completes the look
8:46lashes would be amazing like i said but I think like like a lot of mascara and
8:51like nice and voluminous and i don't know i think it looks really pretty like
8:56the messy Boheme I feel like its bohemian that weird like I feel a
9:00bohemian live with this makeup anyway i'm going to go ahead and finish the
9:04face
9:04so I'm gonna do things a little different usually I do like my highlight
9:09on my cheeks last but because i'm going to go in with a cream highlight
9:13I'm going to do it first you don't have to but I am going to take the Real
9:18Techniques miracle complexion sponge like camera sturdy here and the
9:24highlight I used in my inner corners this is again
9:27lunch money from colour-pop and i'm going to do my my little thing in here
9:32now going to play that to my cheeks as you can see it's intense I blend that
9:40out now
9:41don't worry
9:45I did there well I didn't have been my sponge before I applied it just to make
9:51it even more intense than I want to take the other side and blend it out so it's
9:55not like you know
9:57ok so now i'm going to go eat with bronze that and actually I'm going to
10:02use this product right here with my 129
10:07this is a bronzer / blush product from the bomb it's called the bong desert
10:13freaking in love with this thing because it's a long wearing product and it is
10:17this is what it looks like me show you
10:20I don't know if you can tell but it's like a brown with kind of like a pinky
10:24undertone
10:25it reminds me a lot of Max harmony blush which is one of my favorite brushes from
10:29Mac because i use it as a bronzer as well i have purchased multiple harmonies
10:35like I love it that much but this is a little bit more pink in it
10:38even so i'm just going to take it on this and I'm going to start rubbing that
10:42I'm a tent is an attempt on the force for heads a fivehead Who am I kidding
10:50and I'm not so I mean I guess I mean that I'm not contouring
11:01I'm just bronzing up the skin obviously defining my cheekbones a little bit so a
11:07little bit of contour
11:08it's very very pigmented when you have to be a little bit careful use a light
11:12hand but it's super long wearing like it last all day on the skin and I think
11:17it's a really pretty color
11:18it isn't that I don't know if I mentioned that put the same brush I'm
11:22just going to add a little bit more glow factor a little bit more once a little
11:27bit going to me i'm going to stop drinking coffee before the videos
11:32this is the NYX blush in death a call that and i'm going to put that on the
11:38sheiks just to give a little bit of a glow by the way because i don't have
11:42this blush and you like warm things like why why don't you have it it's really
11:47good and so she used to do you see what's in my mouth
11:53this brush said like a mofo and it was so expensive i paid so much money
11:59I mean it's a great brush I use it all the time but they these mac brushes shed
12:04and and they scratched my face a little bit just a little bit
12:08ok so i am done with my faucet my face and I'm gonna move on to lips I'm going
12:15to take this colour-pop lippie pencil in cake and I lightly go lightly because
12:21this is pick up meant it
12:24gonna apply that and then blend it out with my finger then i'm going to apply
12:30the color pop let me stick that I cannot find I about it
12:42this is Skippy it's a glossy finish not a fan of this on its own but i do like
12:49on top of lip liner like it just put I want my lips to be even glass here which
12:56is a big surprise since i'm a mac kind of gal I'm going to take this dose of
13:00colors lip gloss in the shade
13:02well you know has mean I'm pretty sure this is called undressed
13:13i'm pretty sure it's not on the damn bottle but pressure
13:17ok so that completes this makeup tutorial using the where that line where

14:05thank you guys so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already
14:09and I will see you in my next video
0:17hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look it's
0:21actually really similar to things I've done in the past but i wanted to do a
0:25like orangie Randy smoky using this eyeshadow right here that i have been
0:34using and loving these are the Knicks prismatic eyeshadows and I've always
0:40thought that they were good but I didn't realize how good they were until
0:43recently
0:44oh so you want to laugh
0:48it didn't highlight the inner corner of his eye
0:58ok let's ignore that I ended the video without even doing that
1:04Wow if you haven't tried to these prismatic eyeshadows my next they are
1:10probably one of the best drugstore
1:12if not the best drugs yes they're at the best single eyeshadows at the drug store
1:16right now and I can't believe you haven't been using I got the man I mats
1:19and i can't believe i haven't been using them every single e so this is the look
1:25i came up with it
1:26I know it's similar to things I've done what I wanted to do a full face drug
1:30sort through and I wanted to do something that's perfect for a night out
1:34especially now that we're in the summer with a really like eyeliner so if you
1:39want to get this look then just keep watching
1:42I just quickly wanted to show you guys that I did in my eyebrows using
1:44drugstore products but they take forever so I didn't show it i use the elf
1:47Broadway's and like the loreal brow mascara
1:51so now moving on to priming my eyes
1:53i'm using the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer i purchased mine off of jessie's
1:57girl calm and i love it i love this primary really makes the eyeshadows
2:01stick onto my lid
2:03i'm going to use a base because i want the gold to really pop underneath the
2:07eye shadow so this is a milani eyeshadow stick
2:10not sure what the name is but i'll have it listed below now taking the Knicks
2:15prismatic eyeshadow in the shade bedroom eyes
2:18i'm applying this to my entire lid with a flat shader brush i'm not exactly sure
2:21why I'm going so slow like i'm applying this eyeshadow very slowly and i don't
2:26know why but i love the prismatic eyeshadows if you don't own any please
2:30go out and purchase them they're all good every single one
2:34there's so intense they feel very high-end luxurious then I'm taking this
2:39morphy fluffy brush I like this one because it's very very like small it's a
2:44small fluffy brush
2:46this is the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and I'm taking the orange
2:50color reminds me a lot of a mixture between makeup geeks chickity and peach
2:56smoothie
2:57it's like a nice warm transition shade so i'm using this brush to blend out the
3:03prismatic eyeshadow
3:04so there are no harsh lines and to give that extra little warmth to the crease
3:08then I'm gonna go into this brown eyeshadow right here
3:12yes that one and the palate with the same brush and I'm just going to do the
3:16exact same thing because I do want to add more Brown to it I don't want it to
3:19be just like a straight-up orange crease
3:21even though i like that I just want to add more Brown to the crease there
3:29then I'm just taking a big fluffy brush with no eye shadow and blending things
3:34out so there are no harsh lines you know going into this other prismatic
3:39eyeshadow in the shade girl talk and I'm applying this to my brow bone just to
3:44give a little bit of shine I don't want to apply too much because this is a very
3:47pigmented eyeshadow
3:48so I'm barely tapping it and then I'm going into the white in the palette and
3:52I'm applying that underneath my brow bone
3:54i layered the other one underneath that I didn't want it to be just like a flat
3:57white shape
3:59so that's why then I'm going to go into a brush really similar to a mac 217 it's
4:04like a paddle fluffy blending brush and I'm going to go back into that orange
4:08shade and i'm really going to start blowing out that orange color like I
4:12decided I wanted to be a little bit more orangie in the crease
4:15you know my style so yeah that's just what I'm doing here going back and forth
4:19with that color and then I'm going to take this eyeliner from la girl and I'm
4:25tight lining with this and then i'm applying a little bit to my top lashes
4:29just too just so I could look like there's eyeliner there but there really
4:32isn't
4:33so I'm going to finish off my eyes I mean my face before I finish my eyes
4:37you know i'm priming my face with the Loreal magic Lumi light infusing primer
4:44I believe that's what it's called
4:46and then I'm going to go on with this foundation I wanted to use it because i
4:48haven't used in a long time
4:50i'm using this alpha buffer brush this is the neutrogena healthy mix foundation
4:55I'm in the shade 40 even though mmm i noticed it looks maybe a little too
4:59light
4:59but it's ok bronzer can fix that so I'm applying this to my whole face it gives
5:04a nice radiant just like Chloe look without being too greasy or too much i
5:09really like this foundation
5:10I don't know i don't use it more because it's nice
5:13then for concealer decided to bust out this LA girl Pro conceal
5:21I haven't used it in a long time this is the shape creamy beige
5:24excuse me i'm singing to get this in creamy beige and I hate the packaging i
5:30think i don't use this as much because the packaging is just so hard to squeeze
5:33this concealer out so it drives me nuts but it's an amazing concealer
5:38so i use it so I just started blending all that out and then I remembered
5:44hey this is not the brochure like to use to blend
5:47I'm gonna grab my sedona lace - 17
5:50the perfect brush to blend out my under eye concealer i love it when I said we
5:54wait wait wait
5:55and I decided to plop on the Maybelline magic Lumi highlighting pen this is in
6:01the shade ivory
6:02I like to apply this on top of my concealer because it just brightens my
6:05under eyes a lot more it's not
6:08opaque enough or doesn't have enough coverage to be a concealer on its own
6:10but i do like to use it as a highlighter
6:14that's what i'm doing and then I'm just blending everything out
6:19yeah
6:24I don't know what's wrong with me I'm sorry but yes moving on
6:28so I've decided to do cream products i'm i'm putting on a bunch of cream products
6:33under my powder products so I'm taking the Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer in rich
6:38bronze I like this one more than warm tan it's just a little bit darker and
6:42not as like orange looking so i'm applying this with a makeup geek
6:46stippling brush and I'm just kind of contouring with this and then it falls
6:50off and almost fell out of my hand there anyway back to this
6:55oh my god my roots are so terrible like I cannot believe I haven't had my roots
6:59yet i'm going to do that soon but holy crap there so bad anyway I'm taking the
7:04Real Techniques stippling brush and I'm applying the elf cream blush in the
7:10shade
7:11peach perfection to my cheeks and I barely put anything on honestly the step
7:14was pointless because i barely put any blood on I wanted it to be mostly bronzy
7:19then I'm going to take this
7:21l'oreal lumi cream highlight this is in the shade golden and i'm applying this
7:26to my cheekbones I don't like the powders in this line but i really like
7:29the liquid illuminators that l'oreal just recently came out with so because i
7:33hadn't set my concealer with powder i blend it out with my finger just to get
7:37rid of some of the creases and now i'm going to set my under eye concealer
7:41this is a NYX powder that I couldn't open in the shade banana and this is
7:46just like a paddle brush from zoeva and i am setting my under eyes so that they
7:51don't crease and they stay in place
7:53my concealer there's a place
7:56then i'm going to go ahead and bronze with a powder bronzer now just like to
8:00set everything
8:01this is a Jane bronzer in the shade inspire and this is a morphe brush from
8:06the elite collection and i am just bronze and on my face I'm not doing
8:10anything super crazy not contouring just you know being drowsy
8:15then I'm going to take this highlighter / bronzer by Milani it's called
8:19fantastic and gold and I applied my brush and like the white sections just
8:25so i can add a highlight to my cheeks because if i would have applied it like
8:28in a bronzy section would have been too dark so that is what I did and then I
8:32finished off my eyes by applying that same brown eyeliner to my waterline and
8:37then I really got up in there and I just like a plan I'm like blinking a lot
8:41because i don't like to tug on my eyes but I apply a thick layer of that to my
8:45lower lashline a lot thicker than I normally do and then I just kind of
8:49blend it out with a brush just so that everything could be nice and even and
8:54then with a more dense pencil brush I'm going to dip it into that orange shade
8:58and just go over everything so it doesn't look like a raccoon I so that
9:01everything is nice and blended and it just looks smoky not like a harsher
9:06brown line then the mascara i'm using is from Maybelline and this is there miss
9:10manga rock mascara and I applied it to my top and bottom lashes so to finish
9:15off this look I just took the revlon super lustrous matte lipstick and smoked
9:20peach and i decided i wanted it to be glossy not mat and a little bit more
9:24pink not so peach
9:25so I took the elf extra lip gloss in the shade brian and i just applied it on top
9:30and then that's completes this make this world i really hope you guys enjoyed

0:56I'm not going to be using a primer because this already has priming
0:59benefits in this has a very sheer breathable coverage but it does do a
1:05good job of evening out my skin tone and blurring my pores as you can see it does
1:09have a runny texture so BB water is the perfect name because it honestly feels
1:13like you are applying water to your skin it's pretty amazing
1:17I really like that it has a good amount of SPF it is SPF 30 which is great to
1:23wear during the day so we can protect your skin
1:25the best part about this is that it's oil and alcohol-free so it's perfect for
1:29sensitive skin like myself
1:32this makes my skin feel so incredibly hydrated as well i have been using a
1:36non-stop and I really really love it
1:39so I'm just blending that into my skin
1:41now i'm going to move onto concealer and here i am using the Maybelline fit me
1:47concealer in the shade 15 fair i'm just applying that underneath my eyes because
1:51it has a nice fresh dewy finish so it's perfect with this look
1:56and then I'm just going to be blending that in
2:03i'm also applying that on other parts of my face to highlight and also blending
2:08that in
2:14i'm going to set the places where i apply the concealer and i'm using this
2:19NYX HD powder in the shade
2:21banana this is going to help prevent it from creasing underneath the eyes and
2:27just to make everything set nicely
2:31next I'm going to move onto bronzing up the skin I'm not going to contour just
2:35want a nice warm complexion and i am using the physicians formula bronze
2:39booster in the shade medium
2:46yeah
2:51yeah
3:00then I'm going to go in with blush and the blush I'm using today is the makeup
3:04geek blush in the shade romance
3:06it's a nice soft pink but it does have a gold Sheen to it is really pretty good
3:10the beautiful glow to the skin
3:16and now i'm going to highlight my cheeks using the colour-pop super shock cheek
3:22highlight in the shade wisp
3:23this is just going to add an even more dewy glowy appearance to the skin so i'm
3:27applying on the tops of my cheekbones on my nose and anywhere I want to look more
3:31glowy
3:32now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm going to keep it very simple just to
3:36match the rest of my face makeup ever already primed my eyes and I'm going to
3:40go in with a fluffy brush and dip it into the morphe eyeshadow in vs 13 and
3:46I'm just going to move my brush in windshield wiper motions and apply this
3:49into my crease
3:50now i'm going to take this vanilla shade it is BS 54 also from morphe and on a
3:57pencil brush i'm just applying this underneath my brow bone to highlight and
4:02then I'm going to take this eyeshadow also from morphe it is BS 76 and i'm
4:07applying this to my entire eyelid wet so I did what the eyeshadow just to
4:11intensify it a little bit more and i am just applying this on my entire lid all
4:16the way up to my crease
4:21after that I'm going to take that same highlighting Shady's underneath my brow
4:24bone and apply it to my inner corners to highlight that area too
4:28then I'm going to go back into the original shade we use first and applying
4:34this underneath my lower lashes just to smoke it out a little bit and then to
4:38finish off the eyes i am just using my L'Oreal telescopic carbon black mascara
4:43on my top and bottom lashes so to complete this look I'm going to use this
4:48over a long lasting liquid lipstick in the shade real i'm applying a light
4:52layer to my lips and then i'm going to dab it with my finger just so that it's
4:56not too intense and opaque and i'm just going to top it off with this Ellie

5:06you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
5:09will see you in my next video bye
0:25hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look right
0:31here
0:31it's very dramatic for me at least
0:35I just wanted to go in like a different direction from my recent videos I've
0:38done kind of more natural simple tutorial which I love doing because I
0:43feel like those are easier to recreate what I wanted to do something like more
0:46smoky more like nighttime appropriate i would definitely wear this on a night
0:52out on the town and I didn't want to do anything warm i wanted to do a little
0:56bit more cool tone
0:58I wanted to use more cool tones actually use the Anasazi artist probably because
1:03i've only used it once in a tutorial and I wanted to use it again and the like
1:08pop of silver is this bad boy right here this is the makeup geek foiled eyeshadow
1:13in high wire so i really like how this turned out it's like a bluish silver
1:18smokey eye and i hope you guys enjoyed it if you want to see how to get these
1:22loop and just keep on watching
1:24ok so my eyelids are already primed now i'm just going to jump into this palette
1:28i'm going to take the shape buttery and i'm going to apply this all over my lid
1:32all the way up to the brow bone with the morphe 14 brush just you know to create
1:37like a base for all the shadows to blend well because i use Mac painterly Paint
1:41Pot and that can stay a little bit tacky if I don't get it
1:44then I'm going to take some scotch tape and put that on the side of my eye to
1:48create like a sort of cat eye shape and then i'm going to go into dusty rose and
1:53I'm using the morphe e23 brush this is like my new Holy grill like fluffy
1:59crease brush its toll good i love it anyway so i'm just applying dusty rose
2:03into the crease from the tape all the way to the inside of my I you know I
2:08mean yeah i'm going to take blue velvet
2:11this is the star of the show and this color
2:15you just have to build it up this part like it's a little bit tedious but you
2:19just have to stick with it and work with it i'm using the morphe e17
2:23it's the perfect brush for this because it's like a small crease brush but it's
2:28perfect
2:29it fits right into my crease perfectly anyway so i'm applying that on the outer
2:34part of my eye where the tape is and then I'm dragging it all the way in my
2:37crease as you can see what I'm doing of course and then i'm going to start
2:45applying some eye shadow in the very inner corners of my eyes so basically
2:49I'm putting the blue everywhere except the center of the lid because we're
2:53going to be applying that silver color there so we wanted the Blue to like hug
2:57the silver if that makes sense i mean i always say if that makes sense because i
3:01know it makes sense right yeah
3:03so yes I'm just working back and forth with that color and then i'm going to go
3:07in to make it Peaks boiled eyeshadow in the shade high wire it's like a very
3:11intense silver but it has kind of like an icy blue tinge to it so I like how it
3:16pairs with the navy blue
3:18i'm applying that on the center of my eyelid with a mac 27 know with a mac 239
3:22brush and yes
3:25then I'm going to go back into blue velvet and i'm just going to do the
3:29exact same thing just to intensify the blue and so that the high wire sheet can
3:34blend with the blue
3:37yeah
3:39yeah
3:43yeah
3:45yeah
3:45yeah
3:47then I'm gonna rub off any excess eyeshadow on that brush and then i'm
3:53going to start blending out the harsh edges
3:56I didn't want to add more blue because it would get a little bit muddy so just
3:59clean off the brush and started to smoke out the harsh lines then back into dusty
4:06rose with that same brush I'm going to start blending out the crease
4:10I really like how it looks like the navy blue and it kind of fades into like a
4:14dusty mauve I think it looks really pretty so I'm just applying this right
4:18where the navy blue eyeshadow ends so it looks like a nice and gradient effect
4:22and there are no harsh lines that way either
4:32going right back into the buttery i'm gonna use this as my brow bone highlight
4:37i'm also applying that in my inner corners even though i go back with a
4:42different eye shadows later but anyway yeah
4:45taking the Knicks gel liner in black i'm just applying this to my tight line I
4:49don't like to pull at my eye
4:50that's why i started making these crazy eye movements because i don't like
4:54talking at my eyelids then i'm going to apply some liquid liner this is the NYC
4:59liquid liner and i'm just applying a regular little wing i'm using the tape
5:04kind of like a guideline to where I want the wing to end and then after that I'm
5:12going to move onto my face before it finished my eyes to prime my face and
5:15using the NYX angel veil primer
5:17this is a little bit of a mattifying primer but I find that it doesn't dry
5:21out my skin then i'm going in with my morphe e6 brush and like my new favorite
5:26foundation
5:26this is the ex1 invisible wear foundation i'm an f100 and i'm just
5:31going to apply this on my entire face
5:33this is like a very natural foundation it's like a medium coverage but it just
5:38looks like seconds in it's beautiful and so nicely
5:42I just I love this foundation and this brush has been
5:46heavenly I love it out of stock which totally sucks but I'm hoping that they
5:51will bring it back and stop very soon because it's a good one is a good one
5:55then I'm going to take this Maybelline master conceal it concealer in the shade
6:02fair i believe and you've seen me do is about a million times I'm just blending
6:06that out with my holy grail concealer blender brush the visa don't lace
6:10- 17 I love this to blend out my under eye concealer
6:15it's just so soft and like the perfect size
6:18ok so i just get through that really quickly but I'm taking the Knicks
6:24contour kit
6:25and I'm gonna take the yellow and like the pinky shade and I mix them together
6:29and i'm going to set my under eye can see there with this this is a deli am
6:33tools like highlighter brush
6:42and then I'm going to go ahead and finish off my eyes before I complete my
6:45face
6:46I'm going to go right back into blue velvet and I'm gonna use a makeup geek
6:50pencil brush and I'm going to apply this underneath my lower lashes i had already
6:54applied applied a black eyeliner but i forgot to film that but I just apply
6:59black eyeliner to my waterline and now i'm just smoking out that blue shadow
7:03and I'm dragging it all the way across
7:06I'm going to take the black eyeshadow in the palette called cold and with that
7:11same pencil brush I'm going to smudge that on
7:14yeah and then I put the pallet in the camera and yeah there you go kathleen
7:19i'm just nudging this on the outer view of my I just a deep in that part of a
7:22bit and then to further blend everything so it's not like a harsh dark line
7:28underneath
7:29I'm taking dusty rose and I'm just blending all those colors together to
7:33smoke it out
7:34i'm applying some mascara and then I applied my ardell demi wispies on my
7:39lashes and then that completes the I look so to finish off my face I'm gonna
7:45go right back into the next contour kit i'm using this elf blending brush it is
7:49amazing to contour with it's amazing
7:52so I'm just contouring my face with that cooler tone shade in the next contour
7:56kit and I just love this brush if you guys haven't checked it out check it out
8:01from ELF it's really really inexpensive and it's just so soft and amazing i love
8:06it is just contouring my face like a normally do
8:12then I'm going to go in with this color right here
8:17it's just a little bit warmer than the other one not too warm not orange or
8:21anything and i'm just going to go over that contour again
8:28then I picked up my hair because it was driving me crazy
8:33anyway I'm taking this yellow banana shade and i'm applying it right under my
8:36contour with that deli and tools brush just to intensify the contours just
8:41gonna sharpen it a little bit
8:43and since this look at the little bit dramatic I want my contour to stand out
8:46a lot more than it normally would
8:48now i'm going to do something that i've been loving recently this is the girl
8:52lactic face glow in the shade natural and I'm doing this on a giant so a brush
8:56and I'm applying this everywhere
8:58this is a highlight for the face but it's like the most natural highlight
9:01that it just gives my face in below i put this pervert where I'm all of its
9:07glowy and it makes your skin look nice and radiant without looking grease your
9:10shiny
9:11it's fabulous I'm gonna go in with this to face blush in the shade baby love
9:17it's their new long-lasting 16-hour blushes and I'm taking this brush that
9:21looks like it's for me cool tools but it's not I got it at TJ maxx i don't
9:24even know the brand but it's a big fluffy brush very similar to equal tools
9:28and i'm applying this on my cheeks i really like this color because the
9:31natural color that goes with any makeup looks
9:35I'm going right back into the Galactic face below and natural and applying this
9:40as my highlight I would have normally gone with a more intense highlight but
9:43it was the highlight that was ready for me is how I use it on my cheekbones
9:47well I just packed on a little bit more than I did on my face of course then I
9:51took a pencil brush from sigma and i applied this to my inner corners just to
9:56intensify the inner corner a bit event of it
10:00and then for lips i'm using this essence lipstick in the shade also matt and then
10:06I thought it was just a little bit too Matt I wanted something a little glass
10:08here so i took the revlon lipstick and pink
10:11cognito to give it a little bit more shine and then that completes this
10:15makeup look I really hope you guys enjoyed it please subscribe if you
10:19haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look it's using the new
0:05Manny and makeup geek palette
0:07I know it's currently sold out but i will link it below once it comes back in
0:10stock and it was really really requested to do a look using that palette so i
0:15thought i would give it to you guys now this look definitely calls for fake
0:20lashes but i could not find my eyelash flew anywhere but it would definitely
0:24look better with some policies also i do want to say that my eyelids look a
0:29little bit patchy because i didn't use a very good base underneath
0:33I should have gone in with like a dark basement like a deep purple base but i
0:37just used regular like clear eye shadow primer so i'm going to go ahead and get
0:42started but keep that in mind
0:44so I'm setting down the primer i use and i'm using the wet and wild
0:48eyeshadow in from brulee now i'm going into the palette i'm going to take the
0:53shade of peaches and cream on a fluffy brush and I'm just going to both that
0:57into my crease and then i just added some tape to create a sharper edge
1:02i'm going in with the shade Sora which is kind of like beaches and cream but
1:06like a deeper version really really beautiful and I'm also building that
1:10into Z Greece
1:11I'm going to take the shade of Mars it's a beautiful red shade like really
1:16stunning I'm taking it on it
1:17skinnier crease brush something a little bit more precise and I am just applying
1:21this to the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging it into my crease
1:26now i'm going to take the all over lid shade and this is Aphrodite
1:30i highly recommend you go in with like a base before this step like a deep
1:35plumber like an eyeliner and put it all over your lid because i didn't use a
1:39very good primer so it came off a little bit patchy because it didn't have like a
1:43nice base and I'm just going back into
1:47shade Mars and I'm just blending that into the crease again I want the crease
1:51to be very very red so I'm just adding a little bit more of that color and now
1:56i'm going back into sora with a fluffy brush and just blending that out because
2:00I don't want any harsh lines in my crease
2:03ok so going back to Aphrodite I'm just intensifying the lid just in case some
2:08of it got blended with all that blending and then I just took the exact same
2:13shade Aphrodite and just put that directly into my crease so that it
2:17blends really nicely into the red shade to highlight underneath my brow bone i
2:21used Luna which I probably shouldn't have because my eyebrows look a mess
2:26I'm trying to grow them out i told you guys this already but I'm trying to grow
2:29them out to reshape them so highlighting with a shimmery highlight probably
2:32wasn't a good idea about what ever use anyway so i'm applying some primer to my
2:37face I use the next angel primer and now i'm going in with the ex1 and visit wear
2:41foundation it was a little bit dark for me
2:44casino mama very fair these days but this is in the shade f100 and I'm just
2:49buffing that into my face using a wet and wild flat top kabuki brush and then
2:54i'm going to go in with concealer this is the NARS radiant creamy concealer in
2:57the shade vanilla and for a second I thought I smelled something burning
3:02but then I just kept on filming because i am a very responsible adult filming
3:07comes first
3:08who cares of the house is on fire ok so i am applying this by the way that was a
3:13joke
3:14I assumed it was the candle burning behind me
3:17so yes anyway I'm just blending that nars radiant creamy concealer into my
3:22skin using the 447 brush i applied that underneath my eye
3:27between my eyebrows and just other places of my face I wanted to highlight
3:31and yeah just working on it
3:33doing the thing I usually do i'm going to set all the places i added concealer
3:40and i'm using my RC may know color powder and you know that in my face
3:45this foundation doesn't have like a weird tacky finish so i find that I
3:49don't need to set the rest of my face just the places i added some concealer
3:54so now i'm going to finish up my eyes I'm using the bombs swing and i wanted
3:57to show you guys look at my hand is shaking
3:59I had such a hard time applying eyeliner this day I don't know why my hand was
4:04like shaking so bad look
4:06it's just I couldn't do it so yeah I struggled a little bit with my eyeliner
4:10but I tried to make it work
4:12i'm applying my kiko extra scoop of volume mascara and then I'm gonna work
4:16on my lower lash line
4:18I took the shade frappe on a pencil brush and buff that I'm gonna need my
4:22lashes and then I highlighted my inner corners with blue now this is such a
4:26beautiful inner corner highlight fabulous i'm taking my Urban Decay
4:30eyeliner in the shade mainline it's a really cool teal cool peel blue colors
4:36amazing
4:37so i'm just applying it to my waterline and then kind of blending that a little
4:40bit with a pencil brush and now i'm going in with insomnia it's a beautiful
4:46blue brown reddish she has a bunch of different ships
4:50it's such a pretty color and i just bought that on my lower lash line and
4:54then i just applied some mascara
4:56now i'm going to contour my face i'm using the wet and wild contour brush and
5:00then mixing two shades am using warm porcelain and
5:03cool porcelain these are the makeup geek contour powders I really really like
5:08them and I love mixing these two specific shape to get like a perfect
5:12contour for blush I'm using the Milani baked blush and barium or I love this
5:18blush
5:18I feel like it goes with so many looks and since the eyes are a little intense

2:47tight I'm gonna do my best i will update
2:49you but if you do have this palette or
2:51it's coming to you in the mail this is
2:53the look i created today I used the
2:55greens in the palette kind of mix them
2:57both to get this like really pretty
2:58emerald look this is my favorite way to
3:00use the greens in this palette they're
3:02really really pretty on their own but
3:04makes together they are magical i love
3:06the combination of the two so that is
3:07what i did today and yeah if you want to
3:10see how to get this look then just keep
3:12watching
3:13okay so I'm gonna start with priming my
3:15eyelids i'm using the Urban Decay primer
3:17potion that i always use and then i'm
3:20going to jump into the palette and I'm
3:21going to use this bone color to kind of
3:23set down the primer make sure it's not
3:25sticky and everything blends smoothly on
3:28top so on a fluffy crease brush I'm
3:30taking this peachy orange shade and i'm
3:32going to use this as my transition shade
3:33and putting this pretty much everywhere
3:36on my crease and then i'm going to go
3:39into this little mustard fellow right
3:41here and I'm going to take another
3:42blending brush and really focus this
3:45into my crease and just blending those
3:47two shades together
3:49now i'm going to take a flat shader
3:56brush and zip into this color right here
3:58it's a very mossy green has a lot of
4:01brown to it and i'm going to apply this
4:02to my entire lid and then I took a
4:10fluffy crease brush with no additional
4:11product and blend it out those harsh
4:14lines then i apply this green eyeshadow
4:17right on top so i use the same brush
4:19only I flipped it over and applying this
4:22eyeshadow on top creates kind of like a
4:23really dark emerald look I really love
4:26these two shadows paired together and
4:30then I dip the brush back into that
4:32little mustard shade and i'm using this
4:35to blend everything out making sure all
4:37the colors look nice and blend it into
4:39one another
4:40going back into the palette i'm going to
4:43take this cool tone grey Brown and I'm
4:46going to use kind of like a smaller
4:47crease brush and I'm focusing this color
4:49on the outer parts of my eyes and I'm
4:51also dragging this into the crease just
4:53so that they all mesh well together
4:56I feel like it was missing something so
4:58i added a little bit of that cool tone
4:59brown and then I went back into that
5:03mustard shade and I'm just you know
5:04blend away just lots and lots of
5:07blending going back into this bone color
5:10I'm going to use this to highlight
5:12underneath my brow bone so I took a
5:13little bit of that eyeshadow and then I
5:15dip my brush into this really intense
5:17highlighting shade but I didn't apply a
5:20lot so just a little bit of that
5:21underneath my brow bone just to give it
5:23a little bit something extra and for my
5:26eyeliner I'm using the English gel liner
5:28number 77 i am like the world's worst
5:31eyeliner draw or whatever you know it's
5:35really hard to do this on camera so just
5:37apply a wing or don't apply wing do
5:39whatever you want but i just applied
5:40kinda like a smallish medium-sized wing
5:43and then I decided to move on to the
5:45face before finishing up the eyes i
5:47primed my face using the NYX angel
5:49primer and then the foundation I'm using
5:52is the Milani concealing perfect found
5:54foundation this in the shape creamy
5:57vanilla
5:57this is like extremely yellow i have a
6:00neutral yellow undertone but this is
6:02like yellow but it doesn't look so bad
6:05in the end after applying concealer and
6:08all of that so the concealer i'm using
6:10is the collection lasting perfection
6:12ultimate concealer this in the shade
6:15fair and i'm doing one side at a time
6:17because it is a very mac concealer and
6:20it dries very very quickly so i added a
6:22little bit more and this is very
6:23brightening but it covers really well i
6:26love this concealer and then I applied
6:29some of the Wet n Wild highlighting and
6:31concealing pen right on top just to
6:33balance out the color because the
6:35foundation was just a little bit too
6:37yellow for me so I'm just blending that
6:40in with my Beauty Blender up and then to
6:45set down that concealer i am using my
6:48favorite RCA no color powder
6:52ok so to finish up the eyes i'm gonna
6:58dump dump
7:00whoa what I meant to say i'm going to
7:02jump into the mustard shade again and
7:05i'm using kind of a thicker pencil brush
7:07and I'm applying this to my lower
7:09lashline and then I took the colour-pop
7:12cream gel liner in the shade teaspoon
7:15and i'm applying this to my waterline
7:16and I know I'm like pulling on my eyes
7:18here I never do that I'm so sorry but I
7:20was just trying to apply it as pigmented
7:22as I could so I'm to create a little bit
7:25of darkness underneath my lower lashline
7:27i took that dark green shade on a tiny
7:29little pencil brush and really smoked
7:31out that color and then I applied some
7:34more of that mustard shade just to tie
7:36everything together and to smoke it out
7:38a bit for mascara i am taking the
7:41essence lash princess on my top and
7:44bottom lashes and then i'm going to
7:47apply some inner corner highlight with
7:48this super intensifying highlighting
7:51shade in the palette it's my favorite
7:53for my inner corners
7:54I think it's stunning so I applied that
7:56to my inner corners and then
7:58I popped on some falsies these are the
8:00iler looks like pho mink lashes and
8:03they're really beautiful to add some
8:06black to my tight line just so that
8:08everything looks nice and black i used
8:10the essence smoky liner in smoky black
8:13so let's contour the face shall we this
8:16is the chemical on sculpting powder in
8:18the shade light and i'm using this to
8:20contour my cheekbones this just become
8:24my ultimate favorite contour powder of
8:26all time
8:26this new like light shade it's my
8:28favorite chisels out the cheeks like
8:30nothing i love it it's perfect and then
8:33to just warm up the skin a bit i took
8:35the bhcosmetics satin bronzer in the
8:38shade totally tan and this just warmed
8:41up my skin a little bit because the
8:43cabin upon potter obviously is a little
8:45bit more cool ton't
8:49i also took some of that on my neck so
8:52that everything matched nicely think i'm
8:56losing my voice and ok so for blush i am
9:00taking these you a powder blush in the
9:02shade rose very beautiful pinky mavi
9:05color very beautiful i love it and then
9:09I'm going to take the jcat Triple Crown
9:12baked eyeshadow in the shade
9:14what is this called due diligence that's
9:16right industry due to the legend and i'm
9:18using this to highlight my face my nose
9:20my Cupid's ball all the good stuff for
9:24lips i took the remote exaggerated full
9:27color lip liner in the shade natural and
9:29I just lined my lips and I also filled
9:32it in with this lip liner and then to go
9:36right on top of that lip liner I took
9:38the NARS above it matte lip pencil in
9:41the shade Bettina it's a similar color
9:42only the NARS the pencil is more purple
9:45so you have that complete this look I
9:47hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much
9:49for watching please the trip if you
9:51haven't already and I will see you in my
9:52next video bye
0:13you wanna hear something funny i sat down to film this video and i did one
0:18eye and there was someone there was a lot of fun and then I started filming
0:23and there was no son there's a tornado happening in Florida or something
0:27because the Thunder and the lightning and the rain is so intense that I
0:32couldn't film the lighting is absolutely horn and I know it's going to be a lot
0:36of people commenting saying where are your lights you were talking about like
0:40and yes i know i have been talking about like I've been saying that I'm gonna get
0:43lights but something happened long story has to do with my room and it's a long
0:51story of why I cannot put lights in this room especially the lights that I want
0:56they don't fit i did not explain it my room is tiny here and they just don't
1:01fit so i'm not going to have lights till I'm back home which would be next month
1:05so in a month in a month i'll be on my lighting game
1:11I'm just so stressed out because so many things are going wrong with videos
1:15lately i updated i'm moving and i have no idea how to use the new imovie I
1:19already sucking editing to begin with it is just a hot mess so I got final cut
1:23pro and I'm trying to learn how to use that my friend is teaching me how to use
1:26it and it's just that is the reason why there has been a lack of videos this
1:31week like all of this week and it is because the rain doesn't stop and I'm
1:36trying to learn a new editing software so please bear with me please
1:42the so honestly it has never been this dark in this room ever when I'm filming
1:46usually when it's this dark I'm like forget it I'm not filming today but I
1:49have missed so many videos this week that I thought maybe a dark one or a
1:54shadowy one was better than none
1:57maybe not maybe you guys are like no this is way too dark
2:00I'm not even watching this I don't know I'm stressed out anyway sorry for long
2:05intro i wanted to just update you on a couple of things but today's tutorial is
2:09using the it cosmetics not
2:11leave pretty palette I wanted to do something that was like really smoky and
2:16suitable for like a night out on the town and you can obviously make this a
2:20little bit more dramatic and add false lashes I didn't I never do but i really
2:25really love this look because it is using the more darker shade in the
2:30palette i use the purple and the navy blue so it's kind of like a wearable way
2:34to wear navy blue and purple I feel because those colors seem to be a little
2:40bit less wearable and since this palette is full everyday natural colors i
2:44decided to pump it up a little bit and make it more next time
2:46appropriate I thought it looked pretty good if you want to see how to get this
2:50night out
2:51smokey eye using this palette then just keep watching
2:54so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to be taking my Mac painterly
2:58Paint Pot and i'm going to be using this to prime my eyelids and cover up all
3:02those veins I'm taking this light color right here called soft light and I'm
3:06just gonna be applying this into my crease and just basically using this as
3:09my transition shade just buffing it all over my face
3:14then I'm going to take the purple in the palette called violet and on a flat
3:20shader brush i'm just going to apply this all over my lid all the way up to
3:23the crease and then going to be taking a mac 217 and just blending out those
3:29harsh edges and bringing that color up into my crease a little bit
3:34next I'm going to take this urban decay eyeliner in the color binge and i'm
3:40going to apply this to my waterline and my tight line as well
3:45next I'm going to this navy blue shade called midnight and on my mac 217 i'm
3:50going to start building this color up slowly packing it onto the outer view of
3:54my eye and then dragging it into the crease i'm going to be doing this over
3:59and over again until i get the desired shade that I want is just a lot of
4:03building up and blending so just take your time with this
4:11then I'm just going to take an angled brush and dip it right into that
4:14midnight color and kind of use this as an eyeliner really close to my lash line
4:18just to give it a little bit more dimension and make it look a little bit
4:21more smoky and deep since i'm not going to be using liquid liner that is what
4:27i'm doing i'm going to take the black in this palette and I'm just gonna pack
4:31this on the outer view of my I really focusing it on the outer V just keep it
4:36up a little bit and make it more smoky i'm just going to pack that on and then
4:42start dragging it towards the center of my eye just to blend out the little
4:45harsh line
4:54next I'm going to dip my fluffy brush into the color violet and i'm just going
5:01to start blending out all the harsh lines and really just blowing everything
5:05out and kind of defusing the colors i really want the purple to stand out in
5:09the crease so I'm just packing this on doing windshield wiper motions and just
5:12pulling out the look I'm going to move onto the resume face before I finish up
5:19my eyes and I am just going to prime my face using the Maybelline Baby skin
5:24instant port eraser and the foundation I'm using is my l'oreal true match in
5:31the shade and three natural buff and I am just using a makeup brush to apply it
5:42yeah
5:47yeah
5:55yeah
5:58yeah
6:00yeah
6:05for my concealer i'm going to be using my Maybelline fit me concealer in the
6:10shade 15 fair and i'm just going to draw a little triangle underneath my eyes to
6:15cover up my dark circles and to highlight as well and for more
6:18highlighting I'm just gonna run that down the bridge of my nose in between my
6:22eyebrows a little bit on my forehead on my Cupid's bow and on my chin as well to
6:35blend that out and just using my Real Techniques contour brush

7:16palette and I'm going to use this to highlight underneath my brow bone and
7:24then i'm going to be taking the transforming pearl shade and I'm just
7:28gonna be adding some of that right on top just to give it a little bit more
7:31shimmer because this is a very matte look and then I'm going to add some in
7:36my inner tear duct as well i'm gonna take that midnight color and on the
7:40pencil brush i'm just going to buff this underneath my lower lash line just to
7:44smoke it out the mascara i'm using here is the jordana best / extreme and I'm

8:20for blush I'm using my l'oreal true match in the shade baby blossom it's a
8:24very cool tool and pink and its really like i love this blush and I'm just
8:28gonna be applying it with my it cosmetics blush brush and I'm just

8:53sorry that I've been off my game but I will be back and better than ever
8:57very soon thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't
9:00already and I'll see you next time
0:11yes so today's video is going to be a drugstore back to school makeup tutorial
0:18this is the kind of makeup I would wear to high school and it's using none other
0:23than drugstore products and i'm also using affordable brushes as well
0:27it's a talk through video yeah
0:30so you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching ok so I've
0:33already done my eyebrows and i used the NYX micro brow pencil and brunette and I
0:39said it with the loreal brow stylist plumper in light to medium but I really
0:45natural with my eyebrows today if you guys watch my videos you know you
0:48you know I like a bold brow but I went I just followed the exact natural shape of
0:53my eyebrow to fill in any of the sparse areas i have a little bit of bald spots
0:57in between so i used these two products these are the best drugstore products
1:02for the eyebrows
1:03I do think that no matter what I have to fill my eyebrows and even if i'm not
1:07putting on makeup on the rest of my face
1:09I have to do my eyebrows so that is what I did to get started on my makeup
1:15i am going to get my hair on my face
1:18i bought this specifically for my tutorials
1:22our little hearts but to me it looks like a little bear like little bear ears
1:26oh I just hate having my hair my face when I do tutorials so
1:31ok so I'm going to start off with my face when I went to high school I've
1:34said this about a million times but I didn't start wearing makeup until I
1:38graduated high school till I was 18
1:40like actual makeup in high school I literally had the same routine every day
1:45I put on a brown eyeliner or black depending on how i felt that it huh
1:50brown or black eyeliner on my waterline mascara and lipstick those three things
1:55and that's simply because i didn't like to wear makeup that much in high school
2:00I didn't really get obsessed with it till I after I graduated and I could not
2:04be bothered in the morning
2:05my mom had to like force me out of it even as a senior in high school she was
2:09like like
2:10get up I was one-hundred-percent not a morning person so i did my makeup while
2:16my mom drove me to school every morning and it was only three things so I got it
2:20done really fast but if I had to go back to high school right now
2:23this is probably the kind of makeup I where I still wouldn't wear foundation
2:27I would probably only put concealer on the certain areas that i need concealing
2:31but today i'm going to be using my Maybelline Dream pure BB cream
2:36I love this BB cream is my favorite one from the drugstore it has salicylic act
2:40acted it has salicylic acid acne treatment in it which I find doesn't
2:47really help my skin but it doesn't break me out so I'm all for that i'm using my
2:50Real Techniques sculpting brush and I am just putting that on your face
2:56this is in the shade light to medium sized very very sheer coverage but on me
3:02it doesn't get greasy throughout the day it doesn't get disgusting
3:06if I'm going to be completely honest with you i would recommend something
3:11with SPF I don't think this has SPF especially if you have PE or anything
3:16like that it's smarter to use a product with SPF in it
3:22so if you are going to use this product just put on a moisturizer that
3:25has SPF on first and then going with this
3:29that is what I would do
3:33i'm loving one by tasha at the moment and that is not drug store so I'm not
3:38including it so everyone wakes up really really early to go to school and well
3:45we've got some dark circles folks and we need to cover those bad boys up i'm
3:49going to use the Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser this has
3:54really good coverage but it's really light so i like it underneath the eyes
3:58I have mine in the shade fair and i'm not going to highlight or anything
4:02I'm just gonna dab this underneath my eyes on my dark circles and i'm just
4:08going to blend that out
4:10i'm also going to bring that on to my eyelid to help cover up the veins I have
4:15very veiny eyelids so this is going to help cover them up
4:20conceal it
4:22you could even use your fingers if you don't have makeup brushes just that this
4:25into your under eyes with your fingers
4:30oh great there's a man with a leaf blower ok so let's ignore the leaf
4:35blower really quick
4:37I have to set my under eye concealer no matter what I don't set the rest of my
4:41face with powder because i have dry skin if you have oily skin even normal skin
4:48i do recommend setting your face political last all those are words you
4:52are in school system and I can see I'm using the elf high definition under I
4:56setting powder I lost this and i finally found it
4:58it's one of the best under I setting powders and his life three dollars very
5:03brightening i really like it
5:05using the Real Techniques setting brush
5:23now my face seems a little bit washed out a little bit just like flat there's
5:26not much to it so i'm going to bronze the skin and I'm going to use my ELF
5:31pressed mineral bronzer in 10 toffee
5:33this is a great affordable bronzer I'm taking this real techniques that that
5:38blush brush and I'm just going to warm up the face
5:43I know that contours all the rage right now and all that stuff but guys please
5:52don't feel like you have to contour to go to school please don't feel like that
5:55please don't feel like you need to look like cut production and in fourth period
5:58because you don't I feel like people have this expectation that you have to
6:05look super makeup you all the time and that is not true i mean my eye bags were
6:10on fleek in high school and I never completed them yellow
6:14I didn't have time for that but on the flip side
6:17do not let anybody make you feel like you cannot wear a smoky eye to school if
6:21you want to wear a little smoky eye to school if you want to highlight your
6:25face
6:26put on five layers of foundation if you want to wear that to school do not let
6:29anybody anybody make you feel like you shouldn't
6:32it's just makeup and washes off at the end of the day and if you want to go ham
6:36go ham if you want to not wear makeup
6:39don't wear makeup who cares society these days
6:44um this makeup tutorial specifically is what I would wear to high school
6:50personally so that is why I'm doing it this way because it's what i would do
6:54and it's my tutorial you know
6:56ok now that I don't feel like a zombie anymore all hail bronzer
7:00I love me some bronzer i am going to add a little bit of that same bronzer in the
7:05crease of my eye
7:06I would never have done eyeshadow for high school because I did not have time
7:11for that I love getting my extra 10 minutes of sleep
7:14so just dusting bronzer in the crease will make a world of a difference
7:18it looks like you put a little something something when really it's just a little
7:22bit of runs are you know I feel like doing eyeshadow takes a lot of time and
7:29you have to concentrate and all that stuff so I just messily so that bronzer
7:35in my crease and call it a day
7:36now i'm just using this cultural sense brush to get that same bronzer and just
7:44a little bit underneath my lashes my lower lashes
7:47now i am completely done with my eyes just a little bit of definition and now
7:53i'm going to use the Maybelline lash sensational mascara i love this one
7:57because it gives me a lot of volume and I love having thick lashes no matter
8:01what I do so I'm just going to add just too thin coats of this to my top and
8:06bottom lashes
8:07next I'm going to define the eyes just a little bit of eyeliner on my lower lash
8:13line i'm not going to tight line or anything i'm using the gel pencil liner
8:17by NYX in brown I just think it's a little bit less harsh than black
8:25and then that completes the i zoomed in a little bit just so you can see this is
8:31just a little bit of bronzer in the crease mascara and brown eyeliner
8:36ok so normally at this point i would just throw on some lip gloss lipstick
8:40whatever whatever
8:41lip liner but i am going to apply and need to be of bullish just a little bit
8:45of blush because i know some people like cannot go without blush I'm somebody who
8:49I rather just do bronzer and that's it
8:52some people rather do blush and skip bronzer but i'm just going to add a
8:57little bit of this Milani baked blush in luminaux so because it does have a sheen
9:03to it and I cannot be bothered to highlight to go to school cos hour so
9:07i'm just adding a little bit of Luminoso could create a soft glow to my skin
9:17you see and this way it looks like you highlighted because of the Machine and
9:24the blush
9:25let's have didn't ok and to finish off the look i really recommend something
9:29like this
9:29this is the alpha moisturizing lipstick in the shade in the nude it's more of a
9:34darker a little bit more of a brown dude but it is a sheer lipstick and they're
9:39very very moisturizing it almost feels like a lip balm
9:42so i recommend something like this because it's really easy to throw in
9:45your book bag or to settle in your purse and just reapply throughout the day
9:49without even using a mirror because it's foolproof
9:52since it is so shear and hydrating it's not something that you need a lip liner
9:55with it's not something you need a mirror with so i am just putting this on
9:59and what I love most about this lipstick is that eventually it just dries down to
10:07a mat kind of finish but it isn't uncomfortable it's not mad it feels
10:12hydrating but it's not glossy and I like that
10:15if this lip color is too dark for you go with something a little bit pinky or a
10:19little bit of each year or more natural clear gloss whatever you feel
10:22comfortable with that complete this back to school makeup look I really hope you
10:26guys enjoyed it leave me a comment down below if you actually are excited to go
10:30back to school or if you already started school I might be late on this tutorial
10:33but anyway I love you guys thank you so much for watching please subscribe if
10:37you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:24hey guys so today's video is a tutorial on this look around her
0:31it's using the jack on her favorites palette a tutorial using this palette
0:36has been requested
0:38since i reviewed it and during the move
0:41I lost it I lost this and like five other pilots had a little meltdown
0:46thought they were gone for good and i finally found this in a box of stuff
0:50that I had not opened yet which is weird because i remember correctly makeup in
0:54that box but anyway obviously this isn't a very like natural like makeup look I
1:00thought it would be fun to play around with some glitter like on the lash line
1:04and just to use like Pink's on the lid i used mainly like these colors right here
1:10and this really pretty coral so yes this is the local game of wii i'm french now
1:17hope you enjoy this video and I don't know why I'm wearing this shirt this
1:20shirt totally doesn't go with this look but honestly didn't know what I was
1:24doing I was it was just the shirt I was wearing hashtag lazy if you want to see
1:29how to get this look then just keep on watching
1:31ok so i've already primed my lids and I'm taking this color right here in the
1:36palette and I'm applying this color into my crease as my transition shade now all
1:42of these colors have like individual numbering but it doesn't show up on the
1:46actual palette so i will leave a link down below of the shades i use that like
1:49the numbers that correspond to each shadow i will leave it all in the
1:53description box so now i'm taking this really pretty pinky cranberry shade and
1:59on a flat shader brush i'm applying this to my entire lid
2:03I'm grabbing my fixed plus and I'm spring my brush giving it back into that
2:11eyeshadow and plopping you're right back onto my eyelid to just intensify that
2:15color even more now I'm going to take this really beautiful coral shade and
2:21i'm going to apply this into my crease with a little fluffy brush i actually
2:26got this brush in my Ipsy bag that video will go up after this video sorry it's
2:30taken me so long to post but yeah it's a really nice little blending branch and
2:34i'm just applying that everywhere in my crease I'm taking these two shades one
2:39is a more pinky champagne and the other one is more gold and i'm using that to
2:43highlight my brow bone and then this shade right here take a really pretty
2:47pink iridescent I don't know it's beautiful and on my flat shader brush
2:52I'm just popping that right into the center of the lid just so that like it
2:56looks like the light catches the center of the eyeball if that makes it so okay
3:00really quickly I'm going to my face
3:02ok this is the hourglass primer serum and this has changed the game for me I
3:09want you guys to see how this makes my skin look I do not recommend this for
3:12anybody except super super super dry skin because it's pretty much like an
3:17oil for your face but matte foundation lies beautifully on top of it for me I
3:22couldn't use like matte foundation so much before but it's amazing as you can
3:27tell by my face i really love it so on top of that i'm using it the maybelline
3:31fit me foundation in 120 I'm just darling that on my entire face
3:40of course danny has to you know interrupt
3:45he works all day in the Sun so he's like a different color so I'm blending that
3:50into my skin with my makeup
3:53oh excuse me with my makeup geek stippling brush that conversation
3:58stippling brush i love this is the best brush for foundation and I'm just loving
4:03that right into the skin im using the urban decay and naked in concealer this
4:09is in light no this isn't fair neutral i keep forgetting the name but it's in
4:13fair neutral and i'm applying that underneath my eyes and just highlighting
4:16the rest of my face
4:17honestly I can't like I can't use any other concealer recently because this
4:22concealer is the best out there i'm also going to use that concealer to like
4:26sharpen the eyeshadow event and yeah I just wanted you guys have seen me to
4:31that a million times so i just get that but I'm taking this yellow powder in the
4:36Knicks contour kit and i'm using not to set my under eye concealer it's kind of
4:40like their banana shade that's what it's called
4:43so yes this is an elk brush I used to set it i'm taking this mr. right now
4:49eyeliner by the ball i'll leave the shade name below but it's a really
4:53pretty gray and i just put that on my waterline and my tight line as well then
4:58I'm taking this beautiful matte purple and i am putting this on my lower lash
5:03line with a pencil brush it's such a pretty purple i love it
5:09then I'm just going to drag that purple look it's getting hard to explain but
5:14you can see what I'm doing I'm just dragging the line upwards so it can
5:17match like the top of my eyelid you know I'm saying yeah back into this crocheted
5:24with that same pencil brush I'm just blending that purple out a little bit so
5:28that all the colors can like flow together and match to highlight my inner
5:33corners i'm just using the same two shades i used to highlight my brow bone
5:37now I'm taking this lit cosmetics glitter it's amazing and the lit
5:43cosmetics adhesive and here i'm showing you the glitter i'll be hoping it
5:48doesn't fall everywhere but it's such a pretty red with like a bunch of pink
5:51little I don't know it's really beautiful
5:53this is a tart brush exactly sure that name but it's like their eyeliner brush
5:58and I'm just applying this really really close to my upper lash line just like it
6:02was liquid liner you know like a typical black liquid liner i'm doing that just
6:07with glitter instead and I really kotor now it's just a little touch you can
6:11only tell when your eyes are closed but it's really pretty i like it so I'm
6:15packing on the mascara to my top and lower lashes as well this is the clinic
6:20bottom lash and then i'm applying some demi wispies to my eyelashes and that
6:25completes the eyes so moving on to the rest of the face i'm taking the cooler
6:29toned contouring powder in the Knicks contour kit and i'm using this to just
6:34hollow out my cheekbones and to contour you know because its contract
6:40yeah
6:48and then to just warm up my skin just a little i'm taking the physicians formula
6:55bronze booster bronzer with my Sigma duo fiber brush almost forgot the name and
7:01i'm just adding a little bit of warmth to the face for blush I'm using the NYX
7:05blush in the shade mom it looks so pretty like with any look and since the
7:10eyes are so like BAM and colorful I wanted to go pretty light on the blush
7:14and for the highlight I'm using one by NARS it's so it's a blush but it is not
7:22a bullish it's called reckless and at first I didn't like this because it has
7:25a little bit of glitter in it but it is really really pretty what supplied to
7:29the cheeks I don't know for some reason it's not showing up on camera but it's
7:32pretty intense and I like it and I'm using a real techniques i shadow brush
7:36so to finish up the look i'm using the fergie daily lipstick by wooden wild and
7:42then that completes take a look
7:44thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
7:46and I will see you in my next video
0:00hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look it is
0:06using the two-faced sweet peach palette it's been so highly requested to do my
0:11favorite look with this palette and this is pretty much it
0:14it's very similar to the look I did in my no mirror makeup challenge is
0:18obviously much better because i had a mirror and I really really love it very
0:23warm and summary and fresh
0:26so if you want to see how to get this look then let's just you know get
0:29started
0:30so I've already primed my eyes and I have applied some eyeshadow to set down
0:34that primer
0:35I'm gonna go straight into the sweet fish palette and the first color but I
0:39take is Georgia it's a really pretty peachy pink color and I'm taking this on
0:43a fluffy blending brush applying this into my crease i'm using this color as
0:47my transition shade so all the colors can kind of blend seamlessly
0:51I'm sorry this is like out of focus here but I'm taking it the brown shade in the
0:54palette this is called puree
0:56it's a very very warm peachy orange e brown
1:01I love it so I'm just packing this on the outer corners and drag me into my
1:05crease
1:06I'm going to take the shadow luscious while i like to call it touches
1:10I'm taking the lunches color and i'm applying this on my entire lid using a
1:14flat shader brush
1:15I want this color everywhere like I want it all to be shimmery and then I'm going
1:19to take summer
1:20yum and I'm going to buff that on the outer corners and drag that into my
1:24crease as well
1:25the same thing I did with puree only adding a little bit more depth and
1:29warmth that i took a brush that was a little more dense this one is from
1:32coastal sense it's just like a flat shader brush and I'm packing that summer
1:36young color on the outer corners and then slowly dragged me into the crease
1:41I want any more precise brush to apply more product and then I just took
1:45Georgia to blend all that out to highlight underneath my brow bone i just
1:49took the white shade in the palette my eyebrows are on fire i need to get them
1:53done and then I just took luscious again and applied some more just in case some
1:57of it got blend
1:58no way and now i'm mixing luscious with the white shade and i'm applying that in
2:02my inner corners
2:04ok so starting on my face I'm taking the Knicks born to glow illuminating primer
2:08and then i'm going in with my she sado synchro skin foundation
2:12i'm applying the foundation with my pure sponge i have been loving this
2:16foundation it gives you really good coverage and it just looks really nice
2:20on the skin like it lasts a long time
2:22I'm totally into it lovin it so i'm just applying on my entire face i'm speeding
2:27through this part because you've seen it a million times
2:29now i'm taking my lasting perfection concealer by the brand collection
2:34I got this concealer on amazon I've done a lot of questions where I got it I got
2:37on Amazon because i'm pretty sure we cannot get this in the States so I found
2:42it on amazon
2:43I'm just blending that in with my sponge once again
2:51now i'm going to set down that concealer i'm using my NYC smooth skin translucent
2:57loose powder and I'm just gonna set my under eye concealer with this
3:01this is actually a really great powder it doesn't look powdery on my dry skin
3:05and it was insanely affordable pretty good i'm going to say breathe to break
3:09the mood so I'm going to finish off my eyes I'm going to take my NYX brown
3:15eyeliner my towards your Lee eyeliner in brown and i'm going to tight line and
3:19add that to my waterline as well then I'm going to take some are young and on
3:22a pencil brush I'm just gonna buff that on my lower lash line and then this is
3:31the part where i got really frustrating for some reason i could not do a wing
3:34today like oh my gosh i'm using the ardency Inn punker eyeliner in black and
3:39okay yeah I'm totally out of the frame here this is usually what ends up
3:42happening when i try to do some liquid liner I don't notice i'm out of the
3:46frame
3:47I was so frustrated because it didn't turn out so good but I took my jordana
3:50best / extreme applied that to my lashes and then i went in with some ardell
3:55falsies these are these soft touch for c's and then that completes the eyes a
4:00little bit struggle struggle had a little bit of trouble with that wing but
4:04we survived
4:05so now i'm going in with this NARS duo it's the hot sand and laguna duo
4:10so I'm just taking the Laguna bronzer on this mac brushes like a flat paddle
4:15brush and I'm kind of contouring and bronzing the skin at the same time
4:20this bronzer can do both i feel like it can contour but bronze you up very well
4:24I really really really love this bronzer I'm just bronzing up the skin
4:28now i'm going in with blush this is the to face sweetheart blush in the shade is
4:33sparkling Bellini
4:35I'm kind of focusing my brush on the top two shades not so much like the dark
4:38pink and I'm just popping that on the cheeks it gives you a really pretty
4:43orangi pinky glow and for highlight i'm just going to take the hots and
4:46highlight that's in this duo
4:49i'm applying this with my morphe m310 brush a nice little fan
4:53brush and then i apply some setting spray this is the wet and wild setting
4:57spray and I have popped up on my entire face and then went in with my highlight
5:01again just to intensify it doing this little trick really does intensify your
5:05highlight
5:06it's amazing and then i went in with a different brush to highlight my nose
5:10I don't know why I don't know what I did
5:13so yes and to finish off the look of warning of my lip color this is a fancy
5:17by color pop but I didn't want something so intense i wanted like a milky version
5:21of a coral so I just blend that out with my finger and then i went with this tarp
5:25lip gloss in the shade hella and just put that on top and blended that in and
5:30I really liked how it looked that's like a glossy pinky coral but it's a little
5:34bit more natural and that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching
5:38please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here
0:13it's very simple it's mainly focused on my skin there's something about spring
0:17and summer that I just love looking extra doing extra glowy as if the Sun
0:23and the weather
0:26naturally made my skin look that way but it was makeup is very minimal and fresh
0:31but it is still a full face of makeup just on the natural looking side
0:35i love it i feel like i can wear my makeup like this every single day and I
0:38would be okay with it just changing up my lip color and my eyeliner and I'd be
0:41set so if you want to see how to get this really dewy skin and make up
0:47I guess just keep watching so the first thing I'm going to do is take my hair in
0:51my face
0:52as per year ish already filled in my eyebrows and i use the colour-pop brow
0:57pencil in dope dope
1:00the reason I'm mentioning this is because I've been a lot of questions
1:02from you guys asking if I like it or not and I'm still on the fence with these
1:07color pop brow pencils I like them but I don't love them like i like my honest
1:12hacia one more but this is so affordable at the same time it's like it's awesome
1:16but it's not as waxy as I would like it to be but I used it today and i've been
1:21using it i like it it's just not my favorite to prime my face i'm going to
1:24use the glossy a priming moisturizer
1:27I really really like this reminds me a lot of my Too Faced hangover primer but
1:31it's even more moisturizing if that's possible
1:34it doesn't smell as good as that one but it is very hydrating and it has that
1:38same kind of consistency as well
1:40now usually on a day to day basis I don't apply foundation but this is like
1:46a full-blown makeup tutorial like I'm doing the whole shebang
1:48but today i'm going to be using the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation
1:51I'm going to be mixing it with an oil this is from the blissful body
1:55it's an etsy shop bless my body makes one of my favorite body moisturizers
2:01but you can use any oil you have argan oil holy oil any oil you have this has
2:05like a bunch of different oils in it going to add a pump of this to the back
2:08of my hand I'm in the shade porcelain and then I'm just going to take a very
2:14little amount of this apply to little drops to the back of my hand and mix
2:22that
2:27I'm going to take the elf ultimate blending brush to buff that in before I
2:41apply some concealer i'm going to add some of this guy i just recently
2:44purchased this and i have been loving this
2:47this is the marc jacobs spotlight glow stick pretty much looks like go dormant
2:52you know and honestly the packaging kind of throws me off a little bit
2:57i I don't know if it's marketed like to just apply straight from the thing but I
3:02don't like doing that I'm going to take the sedona least 217 brush and I'm going
3:07to apply this to the tops of my cheekbones and I'm doing this first
3:10because it is a cream product and i want to lay down all the cream products
3:14before i go over with powder
3:19ok so now i'm going to apply some under-eye concealer
3:25I'm going to use my it cosmetics bye bye under eye illumination this is like a
3:29newer concealer i purchased mine either on the it cosmetics website or ultimate
3:33pretty sure I got this on the website if you are familiar with the bye bye under
3:37eye it's pretty much the exact same thing only it's a little bit more
3:40illuminating just going to apply very little like I barely squeeze this onto
3:45my finger and then blend it in because this is really really really thick
3:53yeah
3:58now I'm just blending that in with this tiny little random key go brush face 500
4:06remember how I got this now i'm going to set the under eyes and pretty much the
4:12rest of my face with the RCA no color powder
4:17ok so now I've set my entire face and you could see that myspace is still
4:31glowy but it's not tacky anymore because I said it its own i'm going to bronze up
4:35the skin I'm just going to go ahead and finish my face before I do my eyes
4:38because i'm going to do something extremely simple on the eyes
4:41it's what I've been doing a lot recently and i'm going to use the positions
4:45before we left but a bronze you guys not available this
4:48it's one of the best bronzers I've ever tried seriously I'm going to use my
4:52zoeva looks grand powder brush number 90
4:55I love this for bronzer because it tapers and it's God's perfect i love
4:59this brush
5:05yeah
5:14some on the neck and the jawline
5:17so it's a uniform you know so that's pretty much all the bronzer i want to
5:21add I'm not trying to contour anything but i do like to rub some on my nose
5:25just so that it looks like the Sun kind of kissed my whole face for blush I'm
5:30going to go in with the wet and wild color icon blush in apricot in the
5:34middle
5:35africa in the middle actually just pick this one about walgreens like two days
5:38ago I haven't tried this one
5:45yeah
5:48this is hey multitask brush from Real Techniques this is so beautiful when
5:57it's like two to three dollars gonna take my morphe and b5 brush and just
6:02blend it all together
6:04this is quite possibly my favorite sibling brush of all time
6:08it's really good ok so i'm going to go ahead and start on my eyes because i
6:11want to show you guys a little trick that I've been doing with my highlight
6:14okay so four eyes were going very basic here very minimal
6:18I have been extremely into metallic eye liner for like the past week
6:23rose gold gold like I don't know I've just really been into it one of my
6:27favorite ones is from colour-pop it's called get paid
6:30it's like a rose gold I also love show me that one is like a bronze eagle that
6:351 i've been using a lot too but I'm just gonna tighten with this and add it to my
6:38waterline as well
6:43and then i'll just take a pencil brush and a color like really similar to the
6:47eyeliner
6:48today I'm going to use the l'oreal colour reach sunset
6:51eyeshadow and on this be 36 this is my favorite pencil brush from morphe if you
6:58ever see me using a pencil brush in my videos
7:00nine times out of 10 it's going to be the e36 i have a ten percent off more
7:04peacoat i will link it down below
7:06best pencil brush ever this is the only pencil brush that doesn't hurt my eyes I
7:11know that seems really weird but a lot of pencil brush is just scratch my eyes
7:14are going to add a little bit of this to my lower lash line and a little bit to
7:24my top lashes as well
7:26this color is very very very soft so it doesn't show up too much which I like
7:33four looks like that because i only want to define my lashline I don't really
7:36want to do like an intense look now I'm just curling my life
7:40the shoes and going in with some mascara I'm using the Kiko extra sculpt Volume
7:46Mascara coast to coast
7:49so that completes the guys you can see it's nothing special but it just gives
7:52it a little bit of a pop to the eyes
7:55oh I'm such a fool the reason why i wanted to do my eyes first and then come
8:01back to the face is because i wanted to show you my little trick but I put on
8:06mascara already
8:07usually I don't like to do this part with mascara but it's okay we can do it
8:10i'll show you in a second but first i'm going to take a little bit of the hour
8:14glass powder in luminous light
8:17this is a wet and wild stippling brush and I'm just going to applies some of
8:21this to my face to add a little bit more of a globe because we're not going
8:28enough for highlight i'm actually going to take this product right here this is
8:34the laura geller filter finish setting powder in universal
8:37it looks like it has a bunch of color correcting powders but it's pretty much
8:41like the same pearly kind of finish and this is a very soft very natural
8:47luminous powder like I don't know if you can tell it's like barely noticeable but
8:52i love it
8:54it doesn't emphasize the texture on your skin it's like a really nice soft
8:58everyday highlight but the way i like to intensify it just a little bit is I like
9:03to set my face and then apply the highlight with my face still being wet
9:09so today I'm going to use the wet and wild photo focus setting spray this is
9:12actually a great setting spray and it's like under five dollars
9:15it does make your makeup lasts all day so
9:20and i love the spray nozzle on this it's so fine and with my face still being a
9:26little bit what I'm going to take my fan brush this is the morphe and 310
9:31i'm going to highlight my cheeks
9:48this is an awesome little trick to do for those of you who feel like your
9:52highlight isn't intense enough this is awesome for you and also i feel like it
9:56makes my highlight last longer I don't know what it is
9:59I don't know if it's because i'm applying it on top of a setting spray it
10:03just makes my highlight last all day when i do it like this
10:06awesome so now i'm just gonna let that dry ok so now that my face is pretty
10:12much dry
10:13this is what my skin looks like my face is completely dry it's not tacky
10:18because I initially set it with powder and then I just continue to use powder
10:21products on top like if you saw my skin in person you would never tell I have
10:25super dry skin power make up and then to finish off this look I'm going in with a
10:29lip product this is the honest hacia Beverly Hills liquid lipstick in Dolce
10:33I feel like this color is perfect for spring because it's like a nude but it's
10:38like a quarterly nude
10:39I really like it another the product i cannot get enough of is laguna beach by
10:46Oprah

6:02and then that is the end of this drug store valentine's day tutorial i hope
6:05you enjoyed and I'll see you in my next video bye guys
0:15hey guys so today's video is a one brand tutorial featuring wet and wild I told
0:21you guys recently that i wanted to get back into these one brand tutorial and
0:25today we're using one wild
0:27it was only once I completed this look that I realized I actually have a look
0:32ridiculously similar to this already on my channel that i did not that long ago
0:37so I'm so sorry this looks very similar to a previous look but it is a full face
0:43what a wild look so i decided to just just post it anyway because i really
0:47love how my face makeup turned out and I just like how romantic the look is and
0:52since all of these products are ridiculously affordable I thought maybe
0:56it was worth a watch
0:58the one thing I will say is I love wet and wild as a brand I think they're
1:02probably one of the best drugstore brands
1:05not only in terms of quality but in terms of price but I so struggled with
1:10my eye makeup and I will go into details in the video but i use a combination of
1:14the wet and wild single eyeshadows the comfort zone palette which is probably
1:19the best when a while pilot ever
1:20and i also used this palette this is a new one wild pilot called i'm not a row
1:26and this is the rosy toned one
1:28it has a lot of reds and pinks and I do not like this palette at all i just used
1:33to of the shadows but I just didn't like them
1:37this copper one is the 1i used on my entire lid and I just pictured it
1:41completely different i have to wet it and even after waiting it wasn't enough
1:46it kind of was coming it is coming off right now i don't know if you can see it
1:50there but it was like coming off in patches which probably means this
1:53I makeup won't last that long but I still want you guys to see the whole the
1:58whole process anyway I wanted to do something very very simple because maybe
2:02you're watching this video because you just started out and makeup and wet and
2:05wild is the brand you're looking at first so this I makeup is extremely easy
2:09I just honestly would not recommend the
2:12these pallets i would go strictly for the comfort zone or any other wet and
2:16wild palette like this
2:18the only thing on my face that isn't what a wild is my mascara because I
2:21cannot find my mascara anywhere i purposely bought one for this tutorial i
2:26bought the mega lengths mascara it's in a purple tube
2:29no idea where it is can't find it anywhere but besides that everything on
2:33my face is wet and wild and I am in love with the face makeup like every face
2:38product i use today
2:40I love so much i think that's definitely where the money is at its face makeup
2:45when it comes to what a while and ridiculously cheap way cheaper than
2:48other brands at the drugstore
2:50so you don't forget to leave me a comment down below what you want my next
2:52one brand tutorial to me and i will look into it so if you want to see how to get
2:57this romantic glowy look just keep watching
3:01ok so I'm actually going to start off this tutorial with my brows i'm using
3:06the wet and wild color icon brow shaper this is just like a clear wax use that
3:11to brush my hairs and then i went in with this little ultimate brow kit in
3:15the shade ash brown probably not my perfect shade but i'm using the lightest
3:20powder in the kit and I'm just running this through my brows and just kind of
3:24shaping them the way I want them to it's kind of hard to do it with powder alone
3:28i usually like using a brow pencil and then a powder on top
3:32not just a powder by itself but I don't think it turned out horribly for being
3:36like a weird shade and
3:38yeah so I actually put the wet and wild ultimate brown mascara on top this is in
3:44the shade nothing but brunette I love this bra mascara
3:47it's really good and then i moved on to Z face
3:50this is the wet and wild color icon face primer this is a good primer it just
3:54kind of smoothes out your skin and it gives you a nice base for foundation and
3:58then i went in with the cover off that I say color icon primer
4:01I meant cover all primer and then i went in with the wet and wild cover off
4:05foundation
4:07this one is in the shade fair / light and i'm just applying that on my entire
4:12face using a real techniques sponge I broke out on my forehead after i did a
4:16photoshoot recently like broke out pretty badly on my forehead
4:21don't know what caused it either so strange i'm going to take the come
4:24correct can see they're very similar to the it cosmetics
4:27bye bye under eye it's very very thick so I'm blending it in a little bit with
4:31my finger and then to kind of make it a little bit liquid here i am mixing it in
4:36with this wet and wild
4:38highlighting pen in the shade ivory into you this is just going to make it easier
4:43to blend so i'm highlighting with this as well all over the face like a savage
4:48around my mouth
4:54it takes a while to blend this under eye concealer out but you know doing my best
5:06with the sponge
5:09i'm going to set that concealer using the wet and wild contour little duo kit
5:15thing
5:16this is in the shade duty letter and I took the light shade in the duo and i
5:19use this to set my under eye concealer and anywhere else
5:22I placed the concealer ok so now let's move on to the eyes
5:29i'm going to use this new one wild primer this is the photo focus eye
5:33primer and this is not for those of you who have really dry eyelids because it
5:39can dry out the lids just a little bit i recommend padding it in but it does make
5:43your eyeshadow last all day I took the wet and wild single eyeshadow and creme
5:48brulee and just set that primer down and I went into this out in stl palette this
5:52is the pinky tone one and i took that shade i pointed at and i'm using this
5:57kind of as a transition shade and then I wanted something a little bit more Brown
6:01in the crease so it took the comfort zone palette and i took the shade
6:05labeled crease on the left side
6:07i'm using the same brush just kind of like a nice blending crease brush and
6:11I'm buffing this into my crease as well
6:15I'm gonna take this wet and wild photo focus setting spray and i'm going to wet
6:20this one dollar elf brush and I'm going to dip it into that copper shade in that
6:25palette and I do not like this eyeshadow
6:27I definitely had to wet it because when i tried to use it dry on the other i 0
6:32pigmentation was coming off on the brush like zero it's not the best eye shadow
6:36it kind of splotches off but anyway I took a fluffy crease brush and just
6:40buffed out the edges and then to highlight underneath my brow bone
6:44I took the single shadow and sugar for my waterline i'm using the wet and wild
6:48mega last retractable eyeliner in blackest black really good eye liner but
6:53I poked myself in the eye by mistake and my eyes were a little bit right for a
6:57second there which caused the black to smudge just a little bit because my eyes
7:01were so watery
7:02I took that copper shade i used on the lid and buff that on my lower lash line
7:06and then I took the crease shade I used earlier and did the same thing I wanted
7:12a little bit more depth on the outer corner so I took the shade called
7:15definer and just focus this on the outer corners of my eyes and then i went in
7:20with this wet and wild
7:21I need something with a while this is all wet and wild ok i use the mega liner
7:25in the shade
7:26dark brown and then I highlighted my inner corners with the brow bone shaved
7:30from the comfort zone palette but I didn't record it like it did not record
7:34i'm still trying to get used to this new camera but i'm going to contour my
7:39cheeks i'm going to use that contour duo in the shade due to the letter and
7:42obviously using the contour shade
7:44I'm just chiseling my cheekbones a little and then I wanted to warm up the
7:48skin this is the color icon bronzer in the shade ticket to Brazil
7:53yes it's a nice light color but it gives your face a little bit of warmth really
7:58really pretty i love love love this bronzer so much it even has SPF i love
8:02it is great for blush I'm using the color icon blush in the shade rose
8:06champagne another favorite of mine gives you such a pretty like natural Rosie
8:11flush to the cheeks
8:13these blushes last a long time on the skin as well liked
8:16then I took the highlighting powder in the shade precious petals
8:20and i'm highlighting the tops of my cheekbones with the Real Techniques
8:23setting brush and I'm also highlighting my nose with this powder as well
8:30for my lips I just took the mega last lipstick in the shade bare it all one of
8:35the best lipsticks ever if you want a nice nude and I thought that my face
8:40looked a little bit too Matt so I went in with the photo focus setting spray
8:44but I just like drenched my skin like I super drenched
8:48but yes I give me a nice little glow that completes this video that you guys
8:52so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I
8:55will see you in my next video bye
0:22hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right
0:27now
0:27I got really really requested to do a valentines day makeup tutorial but
0:31there's just so many people uploading them right now that I don't know if I
0:36wanted to but I thought you know what I'm going to sit down and film the look
0:39that I'm going around Valentine's Day so this is what i'm going to wear
0:42it's extremely extremely easy it's like the easiest i look in the history of the
0:48world it's so easy
0:49which is why i wanted to show you guys if you are someone who is just starting
0:53out and make up or you struggle a little bit with your eyeshadow i think this
0:57video is perfect for you because anyone can do this I look absolutely anyone
1:01because i mean it is so easy and basic but I love looks like this on
1:05valentine's day i love red lips for valentine's day it's my favorite and I
1:09know that red lips are extremely typical around times a day but i like it i wink
1:15I think this makeup look is beautiful for any date night you could switch up
1:21the lip color you could literally Christmas who could honestly where any
1:27lip color with this look absolutely any so you do what you want on the lips
1:32I just love red course so if you want to get this really really simple and glowy
1:36valentines day makeup then just keep watching
1:39ok so I'm going to start off with my face and my eyes are so simple i'm
1:43taking the dr brandt pores no more i bought this because of Nicole Guerriero
1:48so I'm just trying it out and I'm going to fill in my pores with this my
1:52foundation of choice today is the lorio Leumi cushion foundation
1:56i'm going to give you guys my thoughts really quick this is such a beautiful
1:59finish on my skin but i'm in the shade w2 and it's so weird you can't tell here
2:05in this clip but it's a little bit pink which is weird since its w - it's like
2:10the strangest thing
2:11it's only a little bit pink not something that's super noticeable but
2:14yes it gives a beautiful nice like fresh finish to the skin and it has really
2:18really good coverage so i'm just applying that to my entire face
2:23for concealer i'm going to mix two of them i'm going to take my LA girl Pro
2:27concealed in the shade natural and i'm going to apply this really really close
2:31to my lashes because my dark circles were pretty bad and this shade in
2:36natural has like a really pretty peachy undertone so for the rest of my face
2:41like to highlight
2:42I'm gonna take the bareMinerals stroke of light in the shade luminous - it's
2:47basically just like a highlighting concealer and I don't know if I like it
2:51kind of kicked up on top of this foundation
2:54I'm still going to give it another try because I've never tried it on top of
2:57another foundation because this was literally the first time I used that
3:01stroke of light thing but I was like looking in the mirror and it just seemed
3:05pretty key and I know it wasn't my la girl concealer because that's like a
3:09Holy Grail consider of mine so i don't know if it was the combination of this
3:13foundation and the bareMinerals thing but it's not my favorite so far
3:17ok so i'm setting my face or my under eye concealer with of course my trusty
3:22RC may know color powder and this is going to help my concealer from creasing
3:27so i'm going to go ahead and do my eyes I'm going to take my Smashbox 24-hour
3:32eye primer and apply that to my entire lid and then I'm going to take this
3:36milani almondy cream crayon stick thing and i'm going to apply this to my whole
3:40lid just so that to my whole with that sounded weird
3:44just so that i can cover up all the veins and stuff ok so the palette i'm
3:48going to be working with is the two faced natural matte palette i'm going to
3:52take the shade heaven and i'm going to set that base i put down and now i'm
3:56taking the shade new tea and I'm bluffing that on the outer corners of my
4:01eye with a nice fluffy brush and I'm just packing this on the outer corners
4:06just so that it shows up a little bit since it's a little bit light
4:09I'm just packing that on fucking it out and then i'm going to start blending
4:12this into my crease and
4:14is pretty much the only shadow we're putting on the lid just so that I can
4:18have a little bit of dimension in my crease that i'm going to highlight
4:24underneath my brow bone with the shade heaven the 1i use first and i'm also
4:28applying that to my inner corners as well
4:32ok so I'm going to takes expresso sex presso I find that so hard to say it's
4:37like a tongue twister
4:38I don't know and I'm taking this on a flat definer brush and I'm just applying
4:43this really really close to my lower lashes and really really close to my top
4:47lashes kind of acting like a nice brown eyeliner but I mean we're going to go
4:52over it here in a second
4:54so I'm going back into new tea and I'm just buffing that on my lower lash line
4:59you know nothing fancy same applies to my shadow there and I'm going to take a
5:03black eyeshadow this is what a wild Panther eyeshadow it's literally like a
5:08dollar and it's super black but I'm taking this on an angled brush this
5:12brush is from sigma and I'm just pretending like if it's a gel liner and
5:18i'm creating a really soft messy type of wing i really like doing these looks
5:23especially if you have a hard time with gel or liquid liner
5:26this gives you the illusion of a wing but it's much softer and I just think
5:31it's really pretty so that's what I'm doing I'm just creating a nice little
5:34wing as usual like you would do with any liner and it just looks softer
5:38I don't know I like it and then I just kind of extended the tail a little bit
5:42so it looks nice and long and then we're pretty much done with that wing it was
5:47so easy so I'm taking casual your bunny and I'm just buffing that on my lower
5:51lashes just to give a little bit more depth
5:53I wanted it to look a little bit smoky there
5:56i'm going to apply some black eyeliner on my waterline and my tight line as
6:00well this is black velvet from urban decay
6:05this is gonna define the eyes just a little bit more then I used my mac
6:10extended plank a black flash on my top and lower lashes and I'm letting my glue
6:14dry but I wanted to show you guys the lashes i'm using they are posh last
6:19year's posh lashes in the shade within the while in the style wispy I'm not
6:25even gonna edit that i'm just going to leave that it
6:26ok i'm taking my color pop highlight in the shade smoking whistles and applying
6:31that to the tops of my cheekbones with my finger and then I took my position
6:34for me love butter bronzer
6:41yeah
6:43that is the song I sing in my head every single time I open this bronzer because
6:49it smells like a tropical paradise but anyway i'm using this to contour because
6:55i really like the undertone and i used a Sephora Pro airbrush in this in this end
7:00up
7:00what in the number fifty-four that is the number of this brush number
7:04fifty-four
7:06I took a stippling brush and I dipped into my kiko flawless fusion bronzer I
7:11just wanted to add a little bit more warmth to my face
7:14so i'm just applying this all over my face and then I had to change my Spotify
7:19because a really emotional song came on
7:21if you are a vampire diaries fan and if you are a Stefan fan that song hits home
7:36it was a very emotional episode anyway i'm applying Mac warms always texting me
7:41i'm applying that warm sold my face and this voiceover is a hot mess but i'm
7:47also highlighting my face with becca shimmering skin Perfector in champagne
7:52pop and i'm just using a zoeva highlighting brush to highlight my fates
7:56of course and then I forgot something in my drawers and I wanted to do a little
8:01dance but I wanted to grab my girl lactic face glow in the shade natural
8:07because I wanted to be extra Khloe so I took my real techniques blush brush and
8:13I'm just pretty much applying this face glow all over my face just to be extra
8:18glowy
8:19ok so to finish off the look I'm going in with a red lip
8:23this is a mac pro longwear lip liner in the shade he said he said she said
8:29why is that hard for me to say i don't know but while I singing to selena gomez
8:35i am going to apply my Milania more matte lip cream in the shade desire

0:59I'm totally serious i wasn't going to because I mean this looks so similar to
1:04looks like hub
1:05i have already done even my own estas the one that i did recently looks a
1:09little bit like this but I don't ever want you guys to feel like I'm not
1:12listening to you and I'm not putting out videos that are being requested this is
1:16rose for you guys who wanted to see it I mean it is a little different because I
1:20normally would pair it with a nude but i love this lip with this look at the same
1:25lip i was wearing in that video the eyes are a little bit different because i
1:28don't exactly remember how i did it to be completely honest with you I don't
1:32really remember so I just you know winged it and it's kind of it's a very
1:37very very very simple makeup look
1:39it's a little bit messy like it's just like shimmer everywhere it's not very
1:44precise and very neat which i really like it gives it like a boho vibe and
1:47very summery
1:48I really hope you guys enjoy this makeup look at
1:51and if you want to see how to get it well just get it
1:54ok so my eyes are already primed and i'm just going to jump into these away but
1:59Coco blend palette i'm thinking the color pure ganache and i am putting this
2:03all over my eye
2:05it's a very intense gold beautiful color
2:09I love it so that's going to go in my inner corners as well just all over the
2:13place
2:14then I'm going to take this really pretty camel color it's called
2:18substitute for love and this is a crease brush by the brand lucky i got in an
2:23Ipsy bag and I'm just blending that into my crease very messily this look is not
2:28precise
2:30so even if you don't know how to blend much this is the look for you just throw
2:34it in there then I'm going to dip my brush into warm notes it's a stunning
2:38cranberry shade and I'm just putting that lightly on top of the gold just so
2:43that it can make more of a role as gold orangi kind of look like the two mixed
2:48together are really pretty
2:50then I'm going to take the color called freshly toasted very similar to max
2:54Browne script you know like in that family and i am putting that on the
2:57outer part and in my crease as well then I'm going to dip my brush into bitter
3:02start and I'm just going to apply that to my brow bone then I'm going to take
3:07more of a regular eyeshadow brush this is from coastal sense and I am packing

4:19thank you so you know the drill going to blend that in with my sedona lace 217
4:24brush and just blend that in that too much concealers so threw me off the
4:32first time I used it because it's not a doe foot applicator it's like a little
4:35tiny brush just thought I'd let you know
4:38oh I was actually looking to the side right there because Cornelius importer
4:42we're having a full-on staring competition
4:45they were both like stiff as stones staring at each other it was so funny oh
4:50my gosh
4:51dogs are so funny anyway so yes blend that out you guys know I'm just London

5:05applying that with like a regular standard foundation brush by Real
5:08Techniques onto my cheekbones

5:17the cream products before i set my concealer
5:19so I'm going to take the bourgeois bronzing primer essentially just like a
5:24cream bronzer and then I'm going to take this angled kabuki style brush by Real
5:27Techniques and I'm just packing this onto my face like on my cheeks to warm
5:31up my face

7:39you guys
7:41please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:07hey guys so today's video is going to be a talk through makeup look on this look
0:13right here and I'm basically showing you my favorite like bulletproof
0:17makeup makeup that lasts all day on my face
0:22if i want to go somewhere and I know I'm going to be out all night
0:25I'll usually use these products and just change them up there are formulas that
0:30work really really well for staying in place for a long time at least on my
0:34skin
0:34i'm also going to be giving you a few like tips and tricks on how to like
0:37apply things and make them last longer and all that stuff so you guys know that
0:41I'm always very very open very very honest on my channel and this video is
0:46sponsored by skin to Naevia
0:48if you guys are not into sponsored videos which I completely one hundred
0:51percent understand then stay tuned for that in my next video that will be
0:56sponsored because this one might not be for you i will be using other brands in
1:00this video b-side Scandinavia
1:02but this video is partnered with them and I was very very excited because i
1:07love Scandinavia since i started youtube so yeah I mainly going to be talking
1:11about these two products from Scandinavia these are the sprays
1:17this is the primer spray and the makeup finishing spray
1:21I'm sure you guys have heard of Scandinavia because a lot of people use
1:24them as makeup finishers and they really make your makeup lasts all day
1:30this is actually one that i purchased myself this one was sent by Scandinavia
1:33but this one I purchase myself when if you guys are my i'm at all like my old
1:38i'm at all i bought it while i was at IMATS and I take this with me every
1:42single time I travel you guys don't seem to use some my channel at all but every
1:45time I go to Miami or California this bad boy comes with me because it works
1:50and honestly when I do tutorials on my channel I'm usually just home and i'll
1:54wear that make up for the rest of the day but i don't really need it to last
1:57all day because nine times out of ten
2:00I stay home I don't do anything ever
2:05um so I don't really show you guys me putting on like finishing spray because
2:09I even spray like setting sprays when i'm done with my makeup but i never do
2:13it in my videos because I just don't think about it
2:16so actually the story behind Scandinavia is really really cool
2:20the founder of skin the Navy actually came up with the idea to make these
2:25products is fairly new but came up with the idea to make like a finishing spray
2:29when he was in Miami like nightclubs in Miami had I live in Miami I'm from Miami
2:36but it's kind of funny to hear that story because he noticed that girl's
2:42makeup like in the nightclub like at the end of the night
2:44their makeup look like it was kind of like melting off like just sweating off
2:49which is understandable it's a nightclub
2:51I get sweaty in there I here I've actually never been to a club side note
2:54never ever been to a club in my life and I'm 23
2:57anyway so he would go to Miami nightclubs and he would notice that make
3:01up on women when was not really lasting and it was just melting off so he
3:05thought of the idea to create his own line of makeup finishing sprays and you
3:11guys know people swear by scandinavia and they're actually a very very good
3:16brand in the Navy actually uses like temperature control technology i don't
3:20know how they do what they do which makes your makeup lasts all day and heat
3:25or humidity
3:26because it's just it's just made to control the oils that shine through the
3:30primer I'm not going to lie this is best for normal to oily get normal
3:35combination to oily skin i have dry skin and i still use this but i only use this
3:40when I know I need my makeup to last all day
3:44this is silicone free by the way and it won't clog your pores sometimes silicon
3:48can clog your pores a little bit
3:50so yeah a friend along i'm going to leave a link down below where you can
3:54purchase in the Navy your product
3:56I do a promo code with Scandinavia i will leave it down below I believe it's

4:36then just keep watching ok so i have already started out with moisturizer on
4:42my face
4:43now i'm going to use the scandinavian makeup primer spray
4:47so you want to make sure that when you spray this you're pretty far away you
4:50don't want to spray it like right here because you just have like a big blob of
4:53you wet mess
4:55Bobby witness moving on to foundation
5:03i love using my revlon colorstay foundation
5:07honestly it's probably the one that lasts most on my face
5:11aside from the makeup on her face and body this one is like glue as well but
5:16it's kind of luminous and lightweight lightweight lightweight i use the one
5:21that's for normal to dry skin for obvious reasons but if you have really
5:26oily skin
5:27I would use just the regular one and i'm just going to get a little bit bizarre
5:30it's a little bit song so I'm just going to mix it in I'm just gonna be like a
5:33hair just the hair of my 150 this foundation
5:38it's really full coverage so I like it when I'm going out to places and it does
5:46have SPF 15 but I don't think it looks bad and photography
5:51like sometimes foundations will give a really like gross flashback but I really
5:56don't think that this one does for concealers when I want a bulletproof
6:01concealer look I have to that I really love that is the urban decay naked skin
6:06concealer or the mac pro longwear concealer these two
6:10once they said they go nowhere a drive down to like a mat natural finish
6:15it's not do its not cakey and it doesn't fade throughout the day these concealers
6:20are the best
6:21today I'm going to use the pro longwear and nw20 going to use the Real
6:25Techniques contour brush to apply that underneath my eyes
6:37and usually like on a day-to-day basis
6:40I will just drag this up onto my eyelids and use this as my eyeshadow primer but
6:48i'm not going to do that today because when I want my makeup to last my eye
6:51makeup to last all day
6:53I like to go in with an actual eyelid primer because that works a little bit
6:59better
7:01ok so you guys know i don't typically set my face because my skin is so dry
7:06for the sake of this video i am going to set my face and especially if you have
7:11normal to oily skin you want to set your face even if you have dry skin
7:16it's just going to prolong the wear makeup i'm using my Rimmel stay matte
7:20long-lasting a pressed powder in translucent i'm going to set my
7:25concealer with this and set the rest of my face
7:29just a little bit with this powder I don't find it to be very very
7:32translucent like it's a little bit white but if you use it gently it serves its
7:37purpose
7:37I actually really like it i'm going to go ahead and move on to my eyes really
7:43quick before i finish the rest of my face
7:46ok so for my eyes I find because my eyelids are so dry that a lot of eye
7:52shadow like last a really long time but sometimes it's a little tricky when you
7:58have oily eyelids for your makeup to last all day on the eyes
8:01I have found the best primer for that is the NARS smudge-proof eyeshadow base
8:07this will not let any of your eyeshadow to crease so your eye shadow will stay
8:12intact
8:13the entire days kind of scary
8:18if you really want to take the extra step i recommend using cream eyeshadows
8:23more so like mac pro longwear paint pots they called prolong or just regular
8:31people
8:31pink Mac Paint Pots but I find that even these last longer than paint pots these
8:38are the maybelline color tattoos 24 hour cream my travels coaches so i am going
8:45to use this i'm going to use the one in chocolate sweet
8:49we're really quickly I want to apply a crease color I'm going to use the Too
8:52Faced chocolate bar palette
8:54this is a tried and true my favorite palette in the world these eyeshadows
8:57last on my eyelids and they're just fabulous
9:00so i highly recommend this palette i'm going to take this morphy e27 and dip it
9:05into this regular like brown shade
9:08we can you do it
9:19i'm doing a really really easy look for today because I want to mainly focus
9:24this look on the face makeup like how to make your face makeup lasts all day
9:30by the way i woke up today and I sound like a boy do I sound like a boy was i
9:34don't know why i don't know i am not sick
9:38I just broke woke up with like a very recipe voice today with that same brown
9:44color I'm going to take it onto my lower lash line by the way that brown color is
9:49called milk chocolate forgot to say that
9:56ok so for eyeliner you're going to want to find an eyeliner that really really
10:04holds well in your waterline whether that be a waterproof one
10:09it doesn't matter everybody's I lives are different and everybody's water line
10:12is different i feel so it's just about trial and error i would recommend trying
10:16ones that's a waterproof or like smudge proof and use those eye liners in the
10:21water line those tend to last longer
10:24this isn't waterproof but it stays a long time on my waterline
10:28this is the Knicks gel pencil liner in black and I'm just going to line my
10:33waterline with this and then a trick
10:39I always do a lot of people don't like to say that this is bad but I've never
10:43had a problem doing this a trick i always do is take I shadow and kind of
10:48set that I wonder we put down not like directly in the water line but i try to
10:54get it as close as possible to just set the cream and it lasts a lot longer so
10:59I'm going to take this dark brown color called amaretto
11:05no it's called triple fudge foot and why it's really close
11:15ok so now for the eye shadow like i said i'm going to use this color tattoo in
11:20chocolate suede
11:22this is a zueva can see their buffer brush and gonna pump pump what
11:29just gonna do this and then apply it to my lid
11:33the more product
11:45I blend out in a second
11:55yeah
12:02I'm gonna go back in with your hairless I should like a dog back into milk
12:08chocolate with this morphe brush i'm just going to blend everything out again
12:16ok so i just added a little bit more of that dark brown just to balance
12:22everything out earlier when I said I was doing a simple look I'm not easy not
12:27natural
12:28obviously i'm just going to quickly highlight with this color right here
12:34this is white chocolate and then champagne champagne champagne truffle
12:42for the inner corner then i'm applying mascara honestly just use your favorite
12:52like waterproof mascara or just your favorite mascara that you know doesn't
12:56flake throughout the day and last and holds the curl so I'm just going to
13:00apply my mailing the colossal volume and then I'll finish the rest of my face
13:03ok so now i'm going to finish off my face I'm sorry this video is so long
13:07already
13:09i'm actually going to apply a cream highlight to my cheeks first
13:14you never should put cream / powder and I already powder my face but I find that
13:19this is a really disturb
13:21what's underneath I'm going to use my cream color based in shell from mac and
13:25i'm going to apply this to my cheekbones
13:27because a really good tip on making your highlight last all day is to layer your
13:32highlights so i would suggest putting a cream underneath creams usually lasts
13:37longer and then powders and then put a powder on top to kind of set it and your
13:41highlight will stay there for a lil busy all day
13:50for contour I'm just going to quickly contour my cheekbones and really really
13:55lightly
13:56I mainly want to focus on the bronzer i'm going to use next but the contour
13:59going to use the caramel toffee wet and wild contouring palette and I'm going to
14:04use the contour side obviously just very lightly
14:08this is a morphy III just to create kind of like a shadow on my face because I
14:24really want to focus this look on some nests bronzer but this is going to just
14:30carve out the cheekbones a little bit
14:33I don't know if you can tell it just kind of gives a little bit of definition
14:36so with the same brush I'm going to bronze up my skin and when I want my
14:42brother to last all day
14:44this works this is the to face and list
14:47summer runser is a 16 hour long wear bronzer
14:52so it's supposed to last 16 hours on your skin
14:55I've never tried it for 16 hours but it does state on my face
14:59the entire day when i use it I'm just going to rub my brush in it and just
15:04bronze up my cheeks
15:08it is Matt you can go ahead and contour with this but it's a little bit
15:13it's neutral so you can control this what I just wanted to end
15:22ok so now I'm going along to blush and these are the best blushes if you want
15:28it to last all day I keep talking about all day all day but I'm a little
15:33repetitive blush is the first thing to go
15:36like when you put on your makeup at the end of the day usually you can't even
15:41see your blush like blushes the number one thing to fade on your face and on
15:46your face yes
15:46so I'm going to use the tarte amazonian clay 12-hour blush
15:51these blushes less forever on my cheeks any color works they have a huge
15:56selection of colors and i'm just going to use this one it was like the limited
16:00edition tartlet one in the shade celebrated because you know one of my
16:04eyes are dark
16:05I don't want to go like super pink just going to clean off this brush on a towel
16:10the same brush i was using and use it as a blush i'm obsessed with this brush
16:13side note
16:14morphy three if you haven't tried these 12 hour blushes
16:21they're good just going to add a little bit of color and honestly what I would
16:29recommend if you are putting on on blush and you're not going to touch up your
16:34face like if you have if you have to do your makeup and make sure that it lasts
16:38all day i recommend putting a little bit more blush than you usually would
16:42and now i'm just going to set that highlight I put down using the hourglass
16:48luminous light and i'm using this one because it's actually pretty natural and
16:51it doesn't look super frosty on the cheeks
16:58I have a lot of lip liners i am a lip liner junkie but to me the lip liners
17:04that lasts forever on my face
17:07are these la girl endless semi-permanent auto lip liner long lasting all day
17:13where they're not getting these semi permanent are like some permanent this
17:18in the shade and natural i'm just going to line my lips these are so affordable
17:21and there's so long wearing now because I don't want my lips to be this dark at
17:30all like it's too dark for this look I think you could I mean whatever i'm
17:36going to take the ELA all day liquid lipstick in the shade
17:41Rosa . and put it on top
17:44liquid lipsticks in general will be your best friend if you want your makeup to
17:48last all day and you don't want to retouch your lip product because they're
17:51like cement and they don't go anywhere so I'm gonna actually put some on my
17:55finger and blend this in
18:04if you want to throw on of lost you can just keep your gloss in your purse and
18:09we touch throughout the day since glosses don't last as long as like Matt
18:13products do so now for the most important stuff
18:16honestly I think it's even more important than the primer spray
18:19it's the finishing spray this is just going to set everything in place and
18:23make your makeup lasts all day
18:26this Scandinavia finishing spray is no joke
18:29I'm just gonna shake it spring
18:37and while that dries with my coffee
18:42it takes a minute or two to fully dry but that completes this makeup look
18:46it's nice and glowing and it will stay that way the whole day I really hope you
18:50guys enjoyed it
18:51let me know down below if you did and also so that we can all talk and all you
18:58know read each other's comments leave a comment down below what your number one
19:03bullet proof like makeup item is your number one item that you use that you're
19:07like wow this is super long wearing and i love it because it lasts all day
19:11leave it below I would love to know thank you guys so much for watching
19:13please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:21hello I look a little crazy right now because
0:24have this I semi done and this eyebrow done and I'm just like a mess right now
0:30I feel really really tired
0:32my hair is so crazy like this is actually my hair with no product in it
0:37but I really wanted to film this video so i didn't have time to do my hair and
0:41I just threw a braid on because my bangs were like out of control and I haven't
0:46even brushed my hair and I'm pretty sure that's a dreadlock
0:50so today i think i'm going to do a talk through tutorial because i haven't done
0:53one of these in a long time so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
0:57fill in my eyebrows and I don't want to do such a crazy bowl eyebrow like I
1:01usually do this might even be too bold for some people but usually I filled
1:05them in a little bit more bold you know i'm going to use the elf eyebrow kit for
1:10this
1:10it's really cheap it's three dollars and it's perfect because you get a wax and a
1:14powder perfect because the wax keeps your hair in place for a really long
1:18time and usually people go to school for like eight hours a day so that's always
1:21great
1:22I'm just going to take the wax part first and just run it through my brows
1:28i'm using a little brush i got at michaels and it cost me like two dollars
1:44after that i'm just going to dip it into the powder and go over it to set the wax
1:54browse are completely optional I just feel like it's a little bit necessary
1:58for me even though in high school and never filled in my brows
2:02never but now I feel like oh I need to fill in moments
2:08this video is probably gonna turn into like a chit chat video which i hope you
2:12guys don't mind
2:13ok so now i'm going to move on to my eyes and going to zoom you in really
2:18quick to prime my eyelids
2:20i'm going to be using this milani shadow lies in the shade
2:25almond cream this is a great pencil because it lasts all day and it does not
2:32crease and it's great because it covers up all those veins on my eyelids have
2:37crazy things there
2:38so I'm going to take it pretty far up and then just blend it out and usually
2:47in the morning if you wake up to go to school really really early your eyes can
2:50be a little bit red and tired and this just kind of masks that
2:56next I'm going to take a fluffy brush like this I got this off morphe brushes
3:01com it was under six dollars and then I'm going to take this single eyeshadow
3:05from Milani and this is called Bella cappuccino
3:08it's just a nice mapped Brown and I'm going to take this and just dust it in
3:16the crease of my eye
3:17so right here right where your eye folds
3:22I'm just going to dust that right here this is just going to give some depth to
3:26the eye
3:27give it a little bit more color
3:35now you don't have to go this far and actually do your eye makeup in high
3:39school
3:40the only thing I want on my eyes with mascara like all through high school I
3:43didn't start wearing makeup - after
3:45so this really is optional but I didn't want to do a tutorial with just mascara
3:52next I'm going to take another milani eyeshadow
3:56this one is called Bella champagne
3:59you're really pretty champagne color champagne and i'm going to take this
4:04brush from Ecotools it's just a dual ended brush I'm taking the shading part
4:09i'm going to differ at in and apply this to the lid
4:13this is just going to add some light to your eyelids so it's not all flat
4:21looking now I'm going to take this Maybelline eye studio quad
4:27I'm not sure if this was limited edition i hope not I got it pretty recently at
4:31my CVS and this is in total tease
4:34I don't think it's limited edition but i'm not exactly sure and i'm just going
4:39to take this light color right here and I'm just going to dust this right in the
4:43inner corners and this is going to make your eyes look more awake going to bring
4:47light to the center
4:49now i'm going to take this dr. Toby shade right here
4:54I'm going to dip my brush and this is a little blending brush from Ecotools and
5:00i'm just going to dust this right on the outer corners just a little bit just to
5:04give a little bit more depth but you really don't have to do this part
5:07especially if you're in a hurry in the morning
5:15then I'm just going to add this light shade again right here underneath my
5:20brow bone just to make my eyebrows look a little bit lifted
5:24i'm going to quickly move on to the rest of my face before I finish up my eyes
5:29and honestly this part is completely up to you it depends on your skin type and
5:33all that stuff if you want to go ahead and put on foundation because that's
5:36what you feel comfortable with and go ahead and put on foundation
5:39you could also use a BB cream it's a little bit less coverage and a little
5:42bit more natural
5:43BB cream is perfect for you guys in high school or anything like that
5:47I just like to go ahead and take some concealer and a bit over the places
5:51where i think i need concealing it's not just diving in with a full face of
5:54foundation so i'm going to be using my Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
5:5810 light this is my holy grail concealer
6:01it's from the drugstore and it is fantastic
6:04so i'm going to go ahead and dab it in between my eyebrows because i have a
6:07birthmark there around my nose
6:10I know I've said it a bunch of times but I have this crazy weird vain
6:17can you see it it drives me nuts and make me look like a homeless - and then
6:23a little bit on my cheeks because they get some redness on my cheeks and then
6:29I'm just going to blend this in with my buffing brush from Real Techniques
6:45I do have some self tanner on so the rest of my body is darker than my face
6:49but I will fix that up with some bronzer
6:57yeah
7:01ok so once it than that i'm going to go ahead and try to hide my dark circles as
7:04best as they can
7:06especially when going to school I know you guys wake up really really early in
7:09the morning and i remember when i was in high school my dark circles were on
7:15another level
7:16so I'm going to take my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser
7:20this is probably one of my favorite products from the drugstore to put
7:23underneath the eyes it's just really easy it's an easy application and it
7:27covers pretty well so i'm just going to dub that underneath my ass
7:41I don't know if i set up but it's in the shade I have it in the shade fair and
7:46then blending that in with my Real Techniques contour brush
8:02now i have really really dry skin so i usually do not set the foundation or
8:08concealer on my face
8:10unless it's like a really do a foundation but this concealer I don't
8:13find that I need to set it on my face
8:15so I'm only going to set my under eye concealer because if I don't set that it
8:19will crease like crazy but if you have oily skin
8:22I definitely suggest setting your face with a powder because you're going to be
8:25at school for a long period of time
8:27so you want to make sure that nothing slips off or you don't get oily or
8:31greasy throughout the day so I'm just going to go ahead and set my under eye
8:33concealer i am using my fit me powder in the shade 135 creamy natural and i'm
8:39just going to set that
8:45ok so to finish off my eyes i'm going to go ahead and take the same milani pencil
8:51i used to Prime and i'm going to add this to my waterline and what this is
8:55going to do is going to make my eyes appear larger and more a week
8:59that's going to mask that redness that my waterline tends to have in the
9:02mornings when I little smudgy brush I'm going to take this color we used earlier
9:10and I'm going to run this underneath my lashes
9:25now i'm going to apply some mascara i am using my revlon gold lacquer grow
9:30luscious mascara the first i am going to curl my eyelashes
9:36now my eyelash curler is not from the drugstore but you can go ahead and use
9:39whichever eyelash curler you own one that i recommend from the drugstore that
9:43seemed to work pretty well for me was from Revlon so i'm going to go ahead and
9:47curl my lashes and then add a few coats of this to my top and bottom lashes and
9:52I'll be right back
9:53ok so after I've applied mascara I'm pretty much done
9:57I'm going to do now is warm up my face a little bit just to give my face a little
10:03bit more life and for that I'm going to use my NYC smooth skin bronzer in the
10:08shade
10:09sunny what it looks like
10:14just swirl my brush this is a real techniques blush brush and I'm just
10:18gonna warm up my face
10:21I feel like bronzer is really important either bronzer or blush because it's
10:25just gonna make you look alive and healthy so if you don't want to use a
10:30bronzer than just add some blush to your cheeks and if you don't want to use
10:34blushed and go ahead and add a little bit of bronzer to your face
10:37you know I'm the girl who prefers bronzer over blush
10:41personally that's just me but it's all about preference and honestly I'm just
10:46warming up my face you don't need to do crazy contour anything it's just school
10:50you know it's not ideal ok now for lips are really just depends on you i wore
10:56the exact same lipstick in high school
10:58since like my sophomore year I wore max pretty please every single day in high
11:03school like that was my signature lipstick i wore it every day
11:07I've gone through like four tubes of that lipstick because I wore it every
11:10day in high school but it depends on you i recommend something like wait like a
11:14lip gloss or if you want to go ahead and use a lipstick because it's going to
11:17last longer throughout the day go ahead and do that
11:19I'm
11:20apply my NYX butter gloss in the shade eclair
11:31these are great because they're not sticky and you just throw it in your
11:36purse
11:37apply between classes ok so that is the complete makeup tutorial i really hope
11:42you like this video like I said you don't have to do all this
11:45honestly this is probably even too much for me because I was the kind of girl
11:48who woke up very very late i didn't have time to do all of this actually have a
11:53video that i will link down below on five easy steps to get a if not flawless

0:23wearing right now and go an itch
0:27cool each i found that earlier today and then I totally forgot to film an intro
0:32for it and then I was sitting here uploading all the clips to my computer
0:37and I was like I didn't come in and throw some time doing right now and
0:41that's why I'm sitting in front of my mirror as opposed to in front of the
0:44window like I am for this entire video
0:47I warned my eyes like this and a lot of videos recently or at least something
0:52like this in a lot of recent videos
0:54the look I was wearing in my last video which was the Ipsy bag video
0:57this basically was what i was wearing on my eyes
1:00this is my goal to smokey eye this looks good on everyone on extremely fair
1:05people on extremely dark people on people with brown eyes people with blue
1:08eyes people three nice this looks good on everyone
1:11and in this video i am using a bunch of different colors for a bunch of
1:13different palettes that I have but they are very neutral colors which means
1:17they're very doable
1:18so if you're watching this and you're like really you're busting out like
1:21seven different palettes like calm down
1:23you can easily find dupes for all these eyeshadows in your collection since they
1:27are so neutral I really hope you enjoy this tutorial it was requested i posted
1:32a picture on Instagram today of me wearing this makeup and people were like
1:37tutorial
1:38well that's what I mean I was going to total regardless but yeah if you want to
1:42see how to get this makeup
1:45you know what to do
1:48so the first thing I'm going to do is prime my eyelids with the Urban Decay's
1:52primer potion
1:54next I'm taking the maybelline color tattoo in barely branded which is this
1:58really pretty
2:00champagne color
2:05yeah
2:08and I'm not going to take this past the crease
2:11I don't want any shimmery shimmer eNOS in the crease
2:16next I'm taking my naked palette and I'm using this color right here called naked
2:20excuse my nails I have not painted them yet
2:23I've just been a disaster with my nails but anyway I'm taking this color naked
2:27right here and I'm taking it on a big blending brush like this and I'm going
2:32to put this into my crease
2:47yeah
2:54now taking this color right here called shroom it's from Mac I'm going to be
2:59putting this on my entire eyelid
3:05yeah
3:07yeah
3:08yeah
3:09now taking the color of book which is just the deeper
3:14Matt Brown in The Naked palette any medium matte Brown will work and i'm
3:20just going to work this and the outer part and into my crease
3:34I'm gonna take a little bit of this color right here called smart which is
3:37just like a very very warm
3:40bronze and I'm gonna work that the same places we put book
4:04yeah
4:09and now basically all i do is just continue to build darker colors into the
4:14crease and the outer part of my eye just to make it very very deep
4:18I start from light colors too dark just because it's easier that way
4:22I'm going to take this color here called Brown down
4:25it is from mac and i'm going to be doing the exact same thing
4:37yeah
4:39and I'm going to work it directly into the socket
4:50yeah
4:53yeah
5:00now i'm taking a black matte eyeshadow this is Panther by what a while and i'm
5:06adding some more depth to the outer corner of the eye
5:09just so that it's not all brown and I'm just packing it on and brush like this
5:21and slightly blending it in
5:25yeah
5:33now i'm taking this color right here from my ceiling and light palette is
5:37called bliss and just giving the look kind of a softer touch here on the
5:46crease
5:54this is just like a dusty rose color
5:58so we have like anything similar like a mommy brown
6:02that will work
6:10and now the last thing I'm putting on my lid is this color right here called
6:15naked lunch from mac and i'm just going to pack this on right here
6:24it's also going to be my inner corner highlight
6:32for my brow bone I'm just taking a matte beige color and hoping that right here
6:40now i'm just going to add some black eyeliner to my waterline and my tight
6:45line and then I'm going to do the rest of my face before I finish underneath my
6:51eyes
6:51the foundation i'm going to be using today is my absolute favorite drugstore
6:54foundation of all time and it is the revlon colorstay foundation specifically
6:59for normal to dry skin
7:01the other formula is way too thick and cakey I really love this formula so it's
7:08going to be popping this on my fires
7:19yeah
7:23I know what you're thinking girl that is too dark but it's not
7:28it matches my neck
7:45ok so far underneath my eyes I don't want to go to dramatic with the light
7:49concealer but i'm going to be using my Maybelline instant age rewind dark
7:53circle racer and just covering my bags a little just enough for it over look
8:00sleepy just kind of like brightening up that under I just a little
8:09I'm not bringing it down all the way to here like I normally do just because I
8:15don't know because I don't always do that
8:25yeah
8:27i'm going to set that under eye concealer with my msf natural
8:33now i'm just going to finish putting some eyeshadow underneath my eyes just
8:38to make it a little bit more smoky and for that i'm going to be taking this
8:43brown color right here called Brown down from mac and taking that on a pencil
8:51brush like this just blending that underneath
9:03ok now I'm going to add a lot of mascara i like using a really volumizing first
9:07mascara for this kind of look just because I don't like to add some winged
9:12liner to this kind of look
9:14you totally can you can just add some winged liner and then some mascara
9:17it would look really pretty regardless if you do i just kind of like to leave
9:21it like this so i'm going to coat the crap out of my lashes with my Jordan
9:26best last we're gonna best / extreme and then i'm going to go ahead and fill in
9:32my eyebrows and then I will be right by so typically if I were doing this makeup
9:37look I would do like the whole contour blush and highlight like the whole
9:42shebang
9:43but today I'm just gonna brand my face a little bit i'm going to be using my
9:47little baby hoola bronzer and by the way i have been loving this bronzer it's
9:51really really good
9:52I can see why everyone loves it i'm going to be using my Real Techniques
9:56blush brush dip an idea
9:59and kind of runs my face
10:05normally when I would contour which is not so specific
10:38ok so for my highlight i'm going to be taking it's a new purchase of my name is
10:44become my absolute favorite highlight in the entire world and it is the josie
10:49maran argan aluminized sir
10:51it's the most beautiful champagne gold highlight which is my favorite kind of
10:57my life
10:58I'm just going to pump that on the back of my hand the only thing that this
11:01squirts out a lot more than what you need just the only thing i hate feel
11:08like like that's way too much but
11:15see that do you see the beauty and you
11:22yeah
11:26yeah
11:34yeah
11:41yeah
11:42for my lips I'm going to be using a combination of two things
11:47i'm going to be using Mac myth lipstick which is a crazy crazy nude
11:53this is like intensely new so I'm only gonna like tap it on my lips
12:06and then I'm going to top it off with the covergirl jumbo gloss balm and
12:10ballet twist and top it with that
12:22ok guys and that's it of course you can change the lipstick you want to wear you
12:26can go a little bit darker but i love how this looks
12:29looks like really light new pink lips
12:32anyway I hope you enjoyed this video please subscribe if you haven't already
12:35and I will see you in my next one
0:20hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i am wearing right
0:26now it is using the Too Faced chocolate bar palette the original chocolate bar
0:30palette AKA my favorite palette of all time
0:33it has been so so highly requested to do a tutorial using this palette since you
0:37guys know it's my favorite
0:39yeah I don't have like any tutorials using it i think i only have like one or
0:43two
0:44this is my go to look with this palette if I'm gonna go out at night time or if
0:49I'm just gonna go out like special events or something like that this is
0:52the look I always do
0:54anyone hear something funny i started doing this tutorial and I did my eyes
0:57first and then i do my face and then I always liked finish up my eyes before I
1:01contour and for my blush a lot what are anyway I completely forgot to do my
1:05lower lash line and i did my entire face i put on my lips take I was even ready
1:10to say goodbye and I realized oh my gosh I didn't even finish up my eyes
1:14so in this video you will see me do like my entire face put on my lip and
1:19everything and then I finish up my eyes so not to confuse anybody would I
1:23totally blanked
1:25so yeah i really hope you like this look let me know if you guys want to see
1:28another tutorial using this palette and if you want to see how to get this one
1:32then just keep watching
1:34ok so I'm going to prime my eyes with the kat von d primer i really like it
1:38because it covers the veins on my eyes but it's a little bit too dark for me
1:42but you could definitely see it on my lids
1:45anyway so I'm going into the chocolate bar palette and I'm going to take white
1:49chocolate and i'm going to set that primary down so that it's not sticky and
1:53this is a Sephora Pro brush and then i'm taking salted caramel which is probably
1:58my favorite shadow in this palette and I'm taking it on my morphe e23 brush and
2:03I'm just putting this into my crease but I'm putting a lot of it like I really
2:07want this crease color to stand out so i'm applying a look
2:11now i'm going into semi sweet which is another brown but
2:15a little bit cooler it's not as warm as a salted caramel and i'm applying this
2:20on the outer portion of my eye and then slowly dragging it into my crease
2:25i'm using a sophie 320 brush but it's just like a mac 217 you know that kind
2:31of shape
2:32so yes as you can see I'm just dragging it little by little into my crease
2:36now i'm taking triple fudge and I'm going to do the exact same thing with
2:40the same brush only i'm applying a little bit more to the owner outer
2:43corners because I really want the outer view of the I to be like saturated with
2:48the brown shadow
2:50so I'm just packing that onto the outer corners and then dragging it all the way
2:54in on my crease
2:58I'm going back and forth it takes a little bit of time because you really
3:01wanted to look gradient and not too messy so you don't want to apply too
3:04much too fast
3:06so just apply the color a little by little and build up slowly
3:09that's how you'll get the best application
3:14I took the color semi nope no salted caramel and i just applied more into my
3:20crease and i'm highlighting underneath my brow bone with white chocolate
3:27now i'm going to marzipan this is like my other favorite shadow in the pile of
3:31it and I'm taking that like on a flat shader brush and I'm applying this
3:36wherever I didn't put any of the brown shadows
3:39then i just applied some pics + and get back into the shadow just to intensify
3:43it a little bit more but i'm just applying this on the inner parts of my
3:46eyes and then I'm going back into triple fudge and blending those two colors
3:51together because i don't want like a harsh line between the triple fudge and
3:55the marzipan
3:56you know just making sure everything is nestled lady going right back into semi
4:01sweet i'm kind of sandwiching the two colors
4:04salted caramel and triple fudge making sure it's a nice gradient effect and
4:10then i'm taking creme brulee and applying that right on top of marzipan
4:13not too much but i just wanted a little bit of gold to shine through and then
4:18i'm going to apply some eyeliner this is the Maybelline lines the little I forgot
4:22how much i love this it's so easy to use this
4:25I love it so i'm just applying you know like a thin little wing or like it's in
4:30the line on top and I'm going to do it up like a wing but i'm not going to like
4:33just yet i'll show you in a little while I'm going to tight line with this
4:38Maybelline master skinny eyeliner i forgot to show this in my drugs to
4:41review i really like it so I'm just tightening with this and I'm taking this
4:45blink ultra thin liner
4:47look at how tiny this is this is like the skinniest little brush tip I've ever
4:54seen in my life so it's so easy to get a really sharp wing with this
4:59it's amazing from the brand blink and it's awesome for a wing amazing
5:04anyway so i'm going in with mascara and then i'm popping on some violet false
5:08lashes in I do
5:11for my face I am just applying my to face
5:14I'm hangover primer and i'm applying that to my whole face and then i'm
5:17taking my aqua foundation from cogiendo and i'm applying this with a wet and
5:22wild
5:22kabuki like flat top kabuki brush love this brush
5:26I really like this foundation it's not my favorite of all time but i really do
5:30like it leaves a nice do we finish it's just very expensive so I rarely use it
5:35on camera
5:36now i'm going to conceal my under eyes and this is the collection lasting
5:41finish concealer i believe what
5:43that's what it's called I got on Amazon because i cannot get that product in the
5:47States but I have to say I really really love it and then I mix it in with my wet
5:52and wild illuminating concealer pen thingy and i'm also highlighting my face
5:56with this as well I love this is from what a while it's like three dollars and
6:00it's awesome
6:01and then I'm just buffing and blending all of that in this is a brush from
6:05bhcosmetics it's just like they're pointed at foundation brush to set that
6:12I'm going to use my RCA in ocala founder of course you already know and i'm
6:17setting that with my morphe e49 brush and I'm also setting the places i put
6:22concealer
6:23I'm not setting my whole face because I wanted to remain a little bit more dewy
6:26and this is the bronzer i've been using a lot recently it's from you and it's
6:30called Sun Tan and I just find it looks so natural on the skin i really love
6:35this bronzer
6:36i'm applying it with my morphe and b5 brush it's just like a chunky stippling
6:40brush awesome brush as well
6:45and this is a new product just recently picked it up
6:48this is from the sephora brand and it is there contouring bronzer in the shade
6:53law squabbles
6:54I really like it's the first time i use it and it's not bad and it's actually
6:57less expensive then a lot of bronzer that sephora i'm contouring my face with
7:03the sigma f 23 brush and yeah I really like that bronzer it's not bad
7:08ok so now i'm going to highlight this is the Natasha's they don't highlight in

4:18decay naked skin concealer in the shade a fair neutral for life
4:24I remember like neutral get there no it's very droll yes fair
4:31ok so you know the drill just blending all that stuff in with my Beauty Blender
4:37ok moving on so i'm going to set underneath my eyes so that the concealer
4:42does increase into my fine lines

4:47I believe that's what it's called i will leave the real date down below so I'm
4:52going to finish off my eyes
4:53I'm going into Pegasus with this pencil brush by makeup geek
4:58it's not called a pencil brush but it looks important so I'm just going to
5:01apply this on the inner part of my eye on the lower lash line then I'm going to
5:06take with Syria and i'm going to apply this the rest of my lashline blending
5:13those two colors together
5:17I'm going to line my waterline and my tight line with Nick's gel liner in
5:21black

6:14everywhere since it has kind of like a pink undertone and then the blush I'm
6:21using on top of it is the Baum's hot mama

5:30thank you so much for watching please
5:32subscribe and i'll see you in my next
5:34video bye guys
0:24hey guys so today's video is a makeup
0:27tutorial on the look i am wearing right
0:30now it is very very glamorous it's
0:33nighttime appropriate I don't exactly
0:34know what I'm going to call this look
0:36but i wanted to do a nighttime look and
0:39incorporate like summary colors in it as
0:42well so this is what I came up with it's
0:44very nice inappropriate but it's also
0:45very summery and warm and i love how it
0:48looks
0:49you could totally wear this look during
0:50the daytime if you want to just don't
0:52add false lashes just regular mascara
0:55and you're good to go but these false
0:57lashes make it look very very like
0:59glamorous and the nighttime it's like
1:01almost too much for me because I'm not
1:03used to lashes and these are very very
1:06long these are really long lashes
1:09absolutely love how it looks and it's
1:11nice to get out of my comfort zone in
1:13terms of falsies every once in a while
1:14so yeah these are my favorite colors to
1:17wear on my eyes I'm using makeup geeks
1:20Vegas lights pigment all over my lid and
1:22it is amazing it is one of the prettiest
1:24pigments ever seen and it is super
1:26affordable and I have my baby amber
1:28lights underneath
1:30I just think it looks really really nice
1:31and very summery so if you want to see
1:34how to get this look then just keep on
1:36watching
1:37ok so I'm going to start by priming my
1:39eyes I'm using Mac's painterly Paint
1:41Pots not only two prime but the cover up
1:43those horrid veins on my eyes
1:48i'm gonna apply this to my entire I and
1:50underneath my brow bone as well
1:53next I'm taking a fluffy blending brush
1:55and Max soft brown eyeshadow and i'm
1:57going to apply this in my crease just a
1:59little bit just so that the pigment that
2:01i'm going to place on my lid transitions
2:03nicely and it's going to be our
2:05transition shade
2:06next I'm going to take the star of the
2:08show and it is makeup geeks Vegas light
2:11pigment and it's a beautiful coppery
2:13color it's amazing and because this pig
2:17man has a lot of glitter i am going to
2:19spray my brush with mac fix+ you can use
2:22eye drops if you don't have six plus but
2:25this is the kind of pigment that really
2:26needs something like fix+ because if i
2:30were to apply it without it would just
2:31be like a bunch of little sparkles all
2:34over my eye and the fix+ really
2:36intensifies it and just makes it so much
2:39prettier so i'm going to apply this to
2:41my entire lid right up to my crease
2:47[Music]
2:52next on my mac 217 i'm going to go into
2:55the color saddle by Mac this is just
2:57like a medium brown with a lot of like
2:59red to it's a very warm Brown and I'm
3:02just gonna start blending out this
3:03pigment little by little
3:05this part is pretty tedious i go back
3:08into the saddle color over and over
3:10again and just slowly but surely start
3:12to blend the saddle color into my crease
3:15and blend away any harsh lines that the
3:18pigment made so like I said it's a
3:21little tedious just go back and forth
3:23and slowly bring that color up
3:28then I'm going to go back into my love
3:30be blending brush and blend out any
3:32harsh edges then back into the 217 with
3:35some more saddle and just slowly defuse
3:37this color and start bringing it up and
3:39blow it out into the crease and again
3:42some more back and forth
3:44[Music]
3:47now i'm just going to take a makeup wipe
3:49and clean any of the follow and then add
3:52a sharp cat I to my eyeshadow so once i
3:57do that and get it nice and sharp as you
3:58see here it looks nice and sharp i'm
4:01just going to go back into the color
4:03soft brown by mac and add some to my
4:06crease

4:27waterline and my timeline and then i'm
4:29going to go ahead and prime my face with
4:32Too Faced primed and poreless primer and
4:38then the foundation i'm going to be
4:40using is my l'oreal true match and three
4:42natural stuff and i'm using this with my
4:45Real Techniques sponge I've actually
4:47been using this a lot more than my
4:49Beauty Blender a kind of neglected my
4:51blood my Beauty Blender a little bit so
4:53this one is just so amazing you can get
4:56it at the real on the Real Techniques
4:57website or an ultra calm i recommend
5:00it's very inexpensive and just as good
5:03as the Beautyblender it does soak up a
5:05little bit more product than the
5:06Beautyblender does in my opinion but
5:08it's really good
5:31next I'm going to add my concealer i'm
5:34using my boo cover up concealer and just
5:37applying it underneath my eyes to cover
5:39my dark circles and to highlight my face
5:41as well have seen me do this part a
5:43million times but i'm just letting it
5:45out with my finger and then I'm going to
5:47blend it out some more with my
5:48self-appointed foundation brush I'm
5:51going to do that to both eyes of course
5:57[Music]
6:02to set my under eye concealer to prevent
6:05it from creasing i am using Mac's
6:06emphasize powder and just dabbing that
6:09underneath my eyes I have to set my
6:11under eye concealer because I'm not it
6:12will crease on me
6:13so this just prevent creasing
6:19now i'm going back onto my eyes I'm
6:22using the bombs winged eyeliner
6:25this is a great high-end liquid liner
6:28it's probably my favorite one dries
6:29matte and it's super easy to use
6:31I'm just going to add a thin line i'm
6:34not gonna wing it out or anything just
6:35the really thin line i'm gonna take my
6:38clinic / doubling mascara and i'm gonna
6:40apply a very thin coat of this to my
6:43lashes because i will be going in with
6:44falsies and the falsies i will be using
6:47our the red cherry 217 and I'm not used
6:51to applying them on camera yet so
6:53forgive me I have to apply them off
6:54camera that takes forever but then i'm
6:57going to move on to underneath my
6:58lashline and i'm using Mac's amberlite
7:01this is my all-time favorite eyeshadow
7:03you guys know this it's so beautiful and
7:07i'm just going to apply a generous
7:08amount underneath my lashes and being
7:12very sloppy with this because I wanted
7:13to be like everywhere underneath my
7:15lashes
7:25then I'm going to clean my pencil brush
7:27and apply max nylon to the very inner
7:31part of my I like the tear duct area

7:35eyeshadow for the internet that's
7:36beautiful
7:38then for underneath my brow bone since
7:39there's so much shimmer going on i'm
7:41just going to take a matte cream color
7:42and apply this underneath my brow bone
7:45here i'm using the cream shade in my
7:47lorac Pro palette just any mac color
7:50will be fine and then i'm going to apply
7:52a thin coat of the clinic mascara to my
7:56bottom lashes i'm gonna add some bronzer
7:59to my face and I'm using the NARS Laguna
8:00bronzer this is such a beautiful summer
8:03bronzer because it has a little bit of
8:04sparkle in it but it doesn't really come
8:06off when you put it on your face it's
8:08just very warm and beautiful so I'm
8:10going to contour my face with this i am
8:12using the papered highlighting brush

8:17around my forehead and you know other
8:20places where you know

8:35[Music]
8:37then I'm gonna add some blush I'm using
8:39milania's Luminoso blush it's a
8:42beautiful like warm peach but I'm only
8:44adding just a light wash of this to my
8:46cheeks nothing too crazy and then for my
8:51lips I'm using Revlon's smoke peach
8:53lipstick and i'm just going to dab this
8:56on a little bit i don't want too much
8:58pigment to come off and then I'm going
9:00to top it off with NYX butter gloss and
9:02fortune cookie i have been using this
9:03non-stop you guys know i've been using
9:05it like crazy so I'm just going to add
9:07that right on top
9:13ok so that completes this nice copper
9:18summer night makeup look I really hope
9:20you guys enjoyed thank you so much for
9:22watching please subscribe if you haven't
9:23already and I will see you in my next
9:25video bye
0:23hey guys todays video is a tutorial on this makeup right here and this had to
0:28be a voiceover unfortunately because when i filmed this I was still trying to
0:33get over my cold but it's a really intense look and it's perfect for new
0:37years eve so the first thing I'm gonna do is take my Urban Decay primer potion
0:42and i'm gonna be putting this all over my lids as my primer then I'm taking
0:45some tape putting it in the back of my hand a few times and then putting that
0:49on the side of my eye to create a cat eye effect and then taking my NYX jumbo
0:54eye pencil in black bean i'm going to put this on my lid and then blend it out
0:58with a brush and I'm not going to be taking this past the crease
1:05I'm going to take max torque I shadow and i'm gonna be using this to blend
1:10this color into my crease this look takes a lot a lot of blending a lot of
1:16dedication and blending it's just you gotta really blend these colors into the
1:20crease this is what's going to make it look nice and smoky and blown out i'm
1:25going to take this color right here it's off from mac and it's called Brown down
1:28and then with a more precise blending brush I'm going to be putting this like
1:32directly into the socket of my crease and then blending it up to get it again
1:36like blown out and more smoky i'm going to go back and forth between blending
1:40brushes and make sure that it's nice and blended
1:47now i'm taking the showstopper of this tutorial and it is this pigment called
1:52utopia it is by make a peak and it's amazing i'm going to spray fix+ on my
1:57brush and dip it into the cap and then start patting this on my lid that fix+
2:02really makes a difference with this eyeshadow it just makes it look old and
2:06metallic and so intense and I'm obsessed with it so I want to get it really
2:10precise right up to my crease and I'm not gonna take it pass there because
2:14it's going to be a glittery mess if I do then I'm taking that browndown color
2:18again and I'm going to start blending some more like I said it's just a lot of
2:23crease blending this is just the tricky part of the whole tutorial is just
2:28really getting those priests colors blend it out so just go back and forth
2:33and I really take my time with this
2:38yeah
2:41yeah
2:47now i'm taking max room as my brow bone highlight and my inner corner highlight
2:53as well then i'm taking my Maybelline master drama eyeliner and midnight
2:59master and I am tight lining with this and also putting this all over my
3:02waterline from my eyeliner I'm using the NYC liquid eyeliner and I'm you doing a
3:07very thin line because I really want the glitter and the pigment to really stand
3:13out so i'm just doing it very thin then i'm taking max carbon on a very very
3:18small shader brush and I'm putting this in my crease very precisely this is kind
3:23of like a soft cup priests because it's not it's not a full-blown cut crease
3:28it's not as dramatic as a cook crease but kinda like the same concept where
3:32I'm just really putting it into the crease very precisely i just go back and
3:37forth and I blend that out that's why I'm fast-forwarding this because I'm not
3:41this video would be like 45 minutes long
3:43it's just a lot of blending like i have said 50 times already
3:48I'm just taking off the tape and then cleaning around my eye
3:56I'm going to take browndown and much that underneath my lower lashline and
4:02then kind of them out of the frame I know I'm terrible but I'm just softening
4:06up the edge of that cat I because i don't want it too sharp and then take
4:10cork by mac and I'm doing the exact same thing I'm seeing my mascara I'm using my
4:16wedding while Michael volume and my jordana best / extreme and I'm just
4:19packing on this mascara you totally could use false lashes I think that
4:24false lashes will look beautiful for this look but you know me guys I'm not
4:28really a fall / where but you go ahead and go on which bed so if you do I have
4:35priming my face with my L'Oreal True Match Lumi primer and then i'm taking my
4:38urban decay naked skin foundation and putting this all over my face is perfect
4:43for New Year's Eve because it photographed beautifully i'm taking my
4:46mac prolongwear concealer and i'm using this to cover my dark circles and to
4:50right underneath my eyes this is also perfect consider for new years because
4:53it lasts all day and it does increase and it doesn't cake and it's perfect for
4:58that then I'm taking my mac msf natural to just set that concealer
5:05I'm taking my benefit hoola bronzer and i'm using this to contour my face and
5:09two bronze up my face a little bit i'm not going to like a super dramatic like
5:14eight contour but i do want to chisel out my cheekbones a little bit for this
5:20look
5:30now taking the next blush in the color mom think it's called pressure and i'm
5:36just adding this really lightly on my cheeks there's so much going on in my
5:40eyes that I don't want too much going on my base then i'm taking my mac
5:44mineralize skinfinish and soft and gentle as my highlight i'm taking my
5:48angel lipstick and then i'm going to top it off with NYX butter gloss and creme
5:52brulee as per usual love this gloss and that completes the look
5:57thank you so much for watching guys subscribe you haven't already and I'll
6:00see you next time
0:26hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing I
0:30wanted to do something around the theme of just like one color like a
0:35monochromatic kind of look kind of like a dusty rose
0:39eyeshadow blush and lipstick kind of look
0:43actually my liner is a lot bigger than I wanted it to be but it's ok actually
0:47really like how it turned out for those of you requesting a very like springy
0:52dewy fresh natural makeup that is coming up soon i wanted to do something a
0:57little bit more bold and dramatic first since i rarely do
1:00looks like this so yes I really use winged liner because i suck at it but
1:06I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone
1:08more and more every day basically if you know how to do winged liner then this is
1:11the easiest look of life the only difficult part is the winged liner
1:15because it's literally the easiest
1:17I look known to man so yeah if you want to see how to get this look then just
1:22keep watching
1:23ok so I'm going to be priming my eyelids with the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
1:26potion this is the new one well i mean i want to say new but it's pretty new and
1:30it's in the shape even i believe and then i'm going to set that with some
1:33translucent powder
1:35so to start off this I look I'm just using two shadows
1:38this one is from NARS it's one of their dual intensity eyeshadows it's in the
1:42shape qari and i'm just adding this as my transition shade you can totally skip
1:46this step because you could do that with this eyeshadow as well
1:50this is the star attraction this is colour-pop superstock super shock shadow
1:55in models
1:57wwat tles yes models that is what I'm putting on my entire lid and in my
2:03crease as well when you're working with color pop shadows in the crease make
2:07sure you're using like fluffy synthetic brushes because they just work best with
2:12the colour-pop formula so i'm using all synthetic brushes here to highlight
2:17underneath my brow bone i just used a light-reflecting powder this is a
2:21setting powder from laura geller just using that to highlight Oh
2:24little bit underneath my brow bone nothing too crazy and then i'm going to
2:28tight line with the next specially liner in jet black or pitch black
2:33yes pitch black and now to apply this wing
2:37ok guys I cannot do my wing on camera because i have to get super close to the
2:40mirror but just do your wing the way you would normally do it my wings got a
2:44little cray-cray as you can see here a thicker than a snicker I didn't want
2:49them this thing but we're going to go ahead and go with it
2:52I think it's cool to have bold line every once in a while so I just prime my
2:56face with the Knicks born to glow illuminating primer and then i'm going
3:00in with foundation
3:01this is the benefit hello flawless oxygen while foundation
3:06this was the first time I used it I am using a more feet esox brush to apply
3:09this and i really like the foundation is a little bit too yellow for my undertone
3:14I have more of a neutrally undertone but it's a really pretty foundation
3:17I forgot to show you the concealer i was using so I'm holding it up here this is
3:21the Maybelline better skin concealer and i'm just applying this underneath my
3:26eyes to cover my dark circles and to highlight my face but you've seen me
3:29blend in concealer about a million times right so i don't have to show you every
3:33little thing just blend netted i'm going to set my under eye concealer with my
3:38cosmetics
3:39bye bye pores powder i'm using a Sephora Pro 90 brush to apply this and I'm also
3:47just applying that on any area where i applied concealer and now to finish up
3:51my eyes i'm going to apply some nude liner this is the Rimmel scandaleyes
3:55nude liner i believe it's called nude
4:00and then I'm going to take models one more time and apply this to my lower
4:03lashline just that it can match with little lint matchy-matchy
4:08for mascara i'm actually not going in with my kiko one
4:11surprisingly i'm going in with the it cosmetics superhero mascara
4:15then I applied some falsies and i'm highlighting my inner corners with
4:19makeup geek whimsical eyeshadow and that completes the is I'm moving on to Z face
4:24right now I'm going to take the Prime and fine
4:27catrice contouring palette I got this at ulta and it was so affordable i think it
4:32was like under three dollars and it doesn't really nice job at contouring I
4:36like the undertone and it blends out really really nicely and then i'm going
4:40to just warm up my skin a little bit using this elf mineral bronzer in the
4:44shade tan toffee and with a morph a stippling brush
4:48I am just loving this onto my face to just add a little bit of warmth to the
4:52look
4:53so for blush I'm actually using the eyeshadow using my crease earlier this
5:00is the NARS dual intensity eyeshadow and khari and yes I'm using i thought i was
5:05a blush because why not
5:07I just wanted everything to match really nicely and I think this is a really
5:10pretty blush so moving on i'm going to highlight the tops of my cheekbones
5:14using the Natasha Nona glow powder in the shade light
5:1801 I'm just blending that on the tops of my cheekbones and on my nose to
5:22highlight and to finish off the look I'm going to add some lip liner this is the
5:27Aquarius lip liner by color pop and then right on top of it i'm going to go in
5:32with another color pop product
5:34this is choker I believe yes
5:37choker Libby stick
5:38that's going right on top of the Aquarius lip liner this is a cream
5:42finish i really like this lipstick
5:44so that completes this video I hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for
5:49watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my
5:52next video bye
0:11hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look right
0:17here
0:17I think this is the first makeup tutorial I've ever done where I'm
0:21completely matte
0:22I'm like Matt guys I'm Matt I'm looking at my skin of clothes and I'm not used
0:28to ever looking this map but I kind of like it actually did a little bit of
0:31highlight on the tip of my nose
0:33I don't know why but I did I love this look I think it's very sexy and smoky
0:37but very simple at the same time I feel like this is the perfect look for
0:42anything any kind of occasion if you're going to a wedding if you're going to a
0:46baby shower if you're going to prom if you're going to graduation
0:48it's not super plane but it's not dramatic either you know it's somewhere
0:52in between and I love wearing this look with no falsies like just a ton of
0:56mascara
0:57I know I've been thinking this isn't like every video but I was smelling a
1:00candle and I accidentally burned off some eyelashes
1:03it's a long story but since i couldn't put on just mascara along this side
1:06because you couldn't see anything i decided to add individual lashes on this
1:11I only and hopefully it doesn't look bad
1:14this look is so pretty for those of you with green eyes or brown eyes or hazel
1:18eyes
1:19I think the pinky purple e tones in the brown I Federals really complement those
1:24colors but anybody can wear this
1:25so you have you want to see how to get this one hundred percent Matt makeup
1:29look then just keep watching
1:31ok so I'm going to start off by priming my eyelids i'm using the Urban Decay
1:35primer potion in the shade enigma
1:37I've really been liking this because a cover-up it covers up all my veins I'm
1:41taking this anastacio eyeshadow in the shade bone to kind of set that primer
1:46down and then I applied some tape to the corners of my eyes to create kind of
1:50like a cat eye effect
1:51make sure when you are doing this you put the tape on the back your hand a
1:54couple times so it doesn't stick to the skin
1:57I took the Anasazi eyeshadow in the shade Gary and I was just applying that
2:01into my crease and buffing that close to the tape
2:04and then I took another anastacio eyeshadow this one is in the shade
2:08birkin and I'm pretty much doing the exact same thing I am bluffing this into
2:12my crease but also applying it to the outer corners as well I took this NARS
2:16eyeshadow in the shade sophia and i am just bluffing that on the outer corners
2:21and into my crease as well I'm pretty much doing the exact same process with
2:25all the shadows only I'm going from light to dark to create kind of like a
2:29gradient effect with these colors
2:31I went back into de-rate by anastacio and I'm just blending out the harsh
2:35edges in my crease so everything is nice and blended so this is another nars
2:40eyeshadow this is in the shade Coconut Grove it's kind of like a super dark
2:43matte Brown and on an angled brush this is an angled brush from zoeva i'm
2:48creating a winged eyeliner but it's going to be a lot softer and a lot
2:53easier to do because you're doing it with eyeshadow so it won't be as harsh
2:56or as hard to do so i'm just getting really close to the tape the tape is
3:00kind of like my guideline to create that wing you see what I'm doing so I'm also
3:05taking a little blending brush and buffing some of that coconut rogue ride
3:09and the outer corners really close to the tape
3:12just like can be nice and blended and then I went back in with the angled
3:16brush and coconut grove and sharpen that up a little bit i'm taking anastacio
3:20bone again and i'm using this to highlight underneath my brow bone and
3:24now we can move on to see face while it took off the tape and now i'm moving on
3:28to the face
3:29i'm using the NYX angel real primer to prime my face for foundation and the
3:34foundation I'm using today is the clinique beyond perfecting foundation
3:38I have the shade linen I really like this nomination when I want to look a
3:42little bit more mad because it has kind of like a satin finish it's not
3:46completely mad but on my dry skin it does look a little bit like satin need
3:51you know I like it I like it doesn't look at drying or anything to go
3:56underneath my eyes I thought that the collection perfect lasting concealer was
4:00literally ideal for this look because it is a mac concealer I don't know how to
4:05explain it but it blends out really well and has great coverage but it doesn't
4:09look dewy under the eyes at all so if you have an oily under eye area i really
4:15suggest this concealer it's a very of a don't know what I'm doing there
4:18but it's very inexpensive and it has great coverage to set that i'm using the
4:22it cosmetics
4:23bye bye pores powder and i'm applying that underneath my eyes with the morphe
4:2748 brush or e 46
4:29i believe so I'm just setting that so it does increase underneath the eyes and
4:33then I thought you know what I want to be mad so I'm just going to go ahead and
4:36set the rest of my face
4:38I probably should have switched brushes because this is very little for the
4:41whole face but whatever I want with it
4:42so to finish off the eyes i'm taking the essence
4:46smokey liner this is like a casual liner like a coal liner in black really black
4:52really awesome great for smudging i took the NARS eye shadow in the shape coconut
4:57grove and I'm just buffing that really really close to the eyeliner to create
5:00kind of like a smoky effect and then I went into the NARS eyeshadow in the
5:04shade sophia and i pretty much the exact same thing making it nice deep and as
5:09smokey
5:10I took the Anasazi eyeshadow in the shade dairy one more time and just bust
5:14that underneath my lower lash line with a pencil brush so it's not too harsh or
5:18too dark and i decided to go in with some individual lashes on my left eye
5:22you guys know accidentally burn them off with the flame of a candle
5:26long story but i decided to pop them on my left eye
5:30I didn't do it on my right I do you think it looks bad i don't know i think
5:33it doesn't look too bad i put on some jordana best / extreme mascara and then
5:38popped on some ardell individuals on my left eye and I think that it balances
5:42out pretty well
5:43I just highlighted my inner corner with that bone shadow
5:47so to finish off the face I'm taking the physicians formula butter bronzer and I
5:52chose this bronzer because it's not completely like one hundred percent matt
5:56has a little bit of life to it not like shimmer or anything but a little bit of
6:01life to it so I thought it would complement this look really well and
6:04then for my sheiks i decided to go in
6:07with a bronzer by urban decay this is in the shade sunkist but it's too pinky
6:12tone for the whole face so I like using it on my cheeks i think it gives you
6:16like a really pretty gorgeous summary look to the cheeks
6:20nice and warm really pretty as a blush I wanted a little bit of something like a
6:24little bit of highlight so I took the laura mercier Matt highlight and i just
6:28bought that on my nose I don't know why but i did so for the finishing touch
6:32i'm going in with these you a liquid lipstick in the shade due to the lecture
6:36I thought it complemented the eyes perfectly and that completes the look
6:40thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
6:43and I will see you in my next video bye

0:22nice and sultry and smoky
0:25perfect for beginners really excited for this one because today's video is
0:27sponsored by she sado i'm going to be using their synchro skin lasting liquid
0:33foundation in today's tutorial and I will go into detail about this guy in a
0:37second i'm usually the shade
0:39golden - but in today's video I mixed a little bit of golden for in with this
0:44because gold into is too light and golden force too dark so I mixed a
0:47little nibble
0:48but besides that I love this look and this I look was created with really
0:52really affordable products
0:54so yes if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
0:57so please excuse my eyes and also excuse my voice I am sick at the moment I'm
1:02going to take the hard candy hydrating primer missed and spring that on my face
1:06and then i'm going to prime my face using the NYX angel veil primer
1:13and for foundation I'm going to be using the shiseido synchro skin lasting liquid
1:19foundation this foundation comes in 11 shades and it was actually designed to
1:24synchronize with your skin so that it can look really natural when you apply
1:26it which I totally agree with by the way I think that once i apply this this
1:31looks really really natural on my skin
1:33shiseido is actually known for their skin care and all of their foundations
1:37have skincare benefits in them which is pretty cool
1:41also this foundation is oil-free it has SPF 20 but I don't find that it gives me
1:46a white cast and photos
1:47I tried with my camera and i get 0 flashback in photography
1:52I also think the coverage is great i'm not sure if you can tell but it does a
1:55great job of covering up my redness but i do think it's buildable I think it's a
1:59medium coverage but definitely buildable because it feels just so weightless on
2:03the skin
2:04so moving on i'm going in with my concealer this is the Catrice camouflage
2:08concealer and this has great coverage so obviously i'm using it because my eyes
2:12are very very red at the moment so I'm just blending that in with my Real
2:16Techniques sponge
2:20-
2:23and then i'm going to set my under eye concealer using my NARS translucent
2:28crystal powder
2:32-
2:35for my bronzer i'm going to be using this bareMinerals bearskin sheer son
2:42serum bronzer it has a long name but I love this liquid bronzer I think it's
2:46one of my favorite later bronzers I've ever tried
2:49I guess because it's a serum it just blends really really well on the skin so
2:53i'm just applying that to my face to not only bronze up the skin but contour a
2:57bit as well i'm going to take this elf total face powder I'm gonna dip my brush
3:04into the bronzer shade in this palette i'm just going to warm up my skin with
3:08this color
3:10I really like this bronzer because even though it is warm
3:13it's subtle and it's not like an orange you warm it's very very flattering
3:17ok I'm just going to take the blush in this palette this is like a really
3:21peachy pretty blush i'm just applying this with my Sonia Kashuk blush brush
3:25and now moving on to the eyes i'm taking this milani shadow stick in the shade
3:29cafe au lait it's a really pretty cool tone brown
3:32I'm just buffing that onto my lid with a synthetic brush
3:37I'm gonna take the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and I'm going to
3:42take this mix crease brush I'm taking this really like brown shade and
3:46blending this into the crease you just kind of get rid of any harsh lines then
3:50I'm going to take the wet and wild single eyeshadow in the shade nutty
3:54this was a super affordable product i think it was like two dollars and I am
3:58just applying this to my entire lid and I'm gonna go back into that brown shade
4:02and just stuff it some more
4:03you know no harsh lines blending monday morning this is another single shadow
4:07from the brand wet and wild
4:08it's called sugar and i'm using this to highlight my brow bone but to highlight
4:12my inner corners I'm taking the elf baked blush in the shade pink tastic i'm
4:17going to type line with a black eyeliner and also apply some to my waterline and
4:21then blend it out with a little angled brush this was the next regularly black
4:26gel liner
4:27i'm going in with this wet and wild eyeshadow another single eyeshadow this
4:30is in the shade panther
4:32it's a really rich black and I'm just gonna use this as an eyeliner instead of
4:36using a liquid liner or a gel liner i'm just going to take an angled brush and
4:40dip it into the eye shadow and create an eyeliner this way it's very very
4:43beginner friendly and so easy to do so then I'm going to go on my lower lash
4:48line and just buff out that brown shade just so that the black doesn't look too
4:51harsh and unblended so I'm just popping on some mascara this is the key go extra
4:56scoop the volume mascara and then i'm going to go ahead and bronze my skin a
5:00little bit more i just wanted a little bit more bronzer
5:03I was feeling more randomness so I'm taking the NARS Laguna bronzer and just
5:08applying that to my face and then to highlight the tops of my cheekbones I'm
5:11taking elf baked blush and pink tastic the same product we use on the inner
5:16corners just to give my face that glow
5:20and then for lips my lips are naturally very very red and pigmented as you can
5:24see so i just take a little bit of concealer and I just wanted to like new
5:27out the color of my lips so just blend that out and then apply the NYX butter
5:32gloss in the shade fortune cookie and then that completes this look

0:27now it is very dramatic for me but it should be it is a new years eve makeup
0:31tutorial and whenever I think of New Year's Eve I think a really dramatic
0:35makeup
0:36it is mainly using the Gwen Stefani palette by urban decay
0:40I used mainly these shadows but i did use this bad boy here this is probably
0:45the star of the show
0:46this is the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade telepathy
0:50it's the color have all over my eyelids this of course is the eyeshadow i
0:54created with the where the night is quad which this quad is available to purchase
0:59right now
1:00this is my newest collab with color pop and i will link this down below i will
1:05link where you can purchase this little quad down below so i know that some
1:09people might not like this because it is like a very harsh kind of islets not to
1:14blended but i really like that for new years eve i think it's different it's
1:18fun
1:18so yes I hope you guys enjoy and if you want to see how to get this makeup look
1:22then just keep watching
1:24ok so I've already applied my eyeshadow primer and i'm applying some tape to the
1:29sides of my eyes to create a sharper
1:31look I'm going into the Gwen Stefani palette but with urban decay and I'm
1:34taking the shade Anaheim and i'm using this as my transition shade i'm applying
1:38this into my crease so that all of the other eyeshadows can blend a lot easier
1:43going into this street called zone it's a little bit warmer and deeper than
1:46anaheim i'm going to take the exact same brush this is a Sephora Pro crease brush
1:51probably my favorite crease brush of all time and i'm applying this really really
1:54close to the tape and then dragging it into the crease that is the main
1:59technique i will be doing throughout this whole video
2:01I'm gonna take the red shade in the palette it's like a really dark rider
2:05it's my favorite shades in this palette and I'm taking as a way of a brush that
2:08looks pretty much identical to the mac 217 and i'm going to start applying this
2:12eyeshadow directly like on the tape and then dragging it in the same way I did
2:17with the crease brush and then I'm going to take a blackout and apply this again
2:21really really really close to the tape and then dragging in I want like a
2:25gradient effect from the tape to the inner corners now I'm going to take the
2:29colour-pop super shock shadow in telepathy and i'm going to start taking
2:33it on my finger i'm applying this pretty much everywhere there isn't the black
2:37eyeshadow and then i went in with a synthetic brush to be a little bit more
2:40precise and I went in with the same so a brush and I'm starting to blend these
2:46colors together
2:47I didn't want like a cool harsh line which it is what what ended up happening
2:52but I wanted to make sure that it didn't look too harsh that everything was just
2:55a little bit more blended I went into the shade
3:00blondie or blogs i'm not exactly sure and I use this to highlight my brow bone
3:05then I went to this really really pretty gold it has a little bit of green to it
3:08so it / pairs perfectly with telepathy and I use that to apply to my inner
3:13corners and then I am priming my face with the Bekaa backlight primer i love
3:19it when i took my Maybelline fit me
3:21matte and poreless a foundation can I speak today my foundation
3:25hit me not important and applying that to my entire face i really really really
3:29love this foundation and i'm using a Sephora Pro air brush to blend that in
3:34and then I got this concealer on amazon
3:37when I was like shopping for some UK makeup and this is the Rimmel wake me up
3:41concealer so i'm just applying this underneath my eyes and other places I
3:45would highlight this is the first time i used it and actually really really like
3:48it i think it's very similar to the Maybelline better skin and Maybelline
3:52fit me Oh
3:53yeah i was watching a really emotional episode of the flash
3:57so I was like crying and really really trying not to mess up my makeup but
4:01anyway just blended that in like you've seen me do a million times and to set
4:04that i am using my NYC translucent setting powder
4:08I just got this to test it out and i really like it didn't look cakey
4:11underneath my eyes which I usually have that problem
4:14ok so back to the eyes before I finish my face I'm going to take zone again but
4:19I'm taking it on a pencil brush and I'm applying this all the way on my lower
4:23lash line from outer corner to inner corner and i'm taking my holy grail
4:27black eyeliner and i'm applying this to my waterline and this is the Knicks gel
4:32black eyeliner and i'm applying this to my tight line as well but not all the
4:36way in
4:37so I'm taking black out and i'm only going to apply this shadow on the outer
4:41corners of my eye I want the inner corners to be nice and bright and like
4:44green gold
4:46I'm going back into that gold and i'm applying this in my inner corners again
4:49just to intensify them a little bit and then i'm applying it a little bit on my
4:53lower lash line and I'm going back into telepathy and i'm applying this on the
4:58inner part of my lower lashline just so that i can match with the top part of my
5:03lid so i'm going in with some falsies and these are the velour still clashes
5:08that they made with some for other not mink
5:10they are soaked and um they're pretty good i like them so i'm going to contour
5:15my face using the morphe and the contour palette and I'm gonna contour my face
5:20with the shade I . that I'm just contouring like I usually do
5:25warming up the skin you know you know
5:31and now i want to brighten up my under eyes so I'm taking this really like
5:35shade in the palette and on my real techniques setting brush i'm just
5:39applying this underneath my eyes to really brighten up the look
5:45and I'm not really into this whole baking trend i don't i don't really do
5:49it at all but I think for new years eve for like a special occasion it
5:53it does look really nice so I'm just doing that underneath my contour to make
5:57my contour a little bit more visible and then I'm just brushing it away a couple
6:00minutes later and it really does help make your content look nice and sharp so
6:06for blush I'm taking my favorite blush of all time I just goes with everything
6:10this is nars madly blush
6:12it's my all-time favorite and i'm just applying this on to the sheiks and then
6:16i'm going in with highlights
6:18this is the Knicks illuminator in the sheet of ritual istic and I like it but
6:22it takes a lot of building up its kind of like a stiffer formula so it's not
6:26really intense it's not bad it's just um I really have to build up for the color
6:31to show and I'm going to go in with this 24 of collection lip liner in the shade
6:36nudists but it was a little bit too purple for me so I want i wanted
6:41something a little peach here so i took the kat von d liquid lipstick in noble
6:44and I applied it on top and then that completes this look I really hope you
6:48guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you
6:52haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:24hey guys so today's to do is another tutorial using the Urban Decay electric
0:29palette it is mainly well pretty much only using thrash and gonzo it's a
0:36little bit wearable i feel i would definitely go out and rock this and
0:40where this which I am today about you guys did ask me if I could do some more
0:45tutorials using this palette and of course I will absolutely
0:49why not I think people are kind of afraid of that palette because there's
0:53just so many crazy colors in it but you don't have to use all of those colors
0:57you can use different eyeshadows with those colors more neutral ones more
1:02wearable ones you could use that palette for like a pop of color one day in the
1:06spring and summer I just think that people are a little bit overwhelmed with
1:09the palette because there's so many colors and like nothing neutral you can
1:13kind of mix imagine you can come up with wearable looks with that pilot believe
1:17it or not this look right here maybe wearable for some people and for others
1:21and maybe like whoa even that's together phone too intense for me so I mean it's
1:25all about preference
1:26some people like it some people want but it's fun to experiment with colors I
1:29feel since i'm a very neutral girl so I'm really loving this palette so far so
1:34if you want to see how to get this line green and teal look then just keep
1:38watching
1:39ok let's do this i'm priming my eyes with Mac's painterly Paint Pot and i'm
1:45going to take this all over my lid and up to my eyebrow then I'm going to take
1:50an eyeshadow that is pretty much the exact same color as my skin tone and I'm
1:54going to put this all over my lid and underneath my brow bone to highlight as
1:58well
2:03I'm going to take an eyeshadow this just a couple shades darker than my actual
2:06skin tone or not even a couple shades just like a shade darker than my skin
2:10tone and i'm going to be blending this into the crease and this is gonna be our
2:14transition color use any eyeshadow you have now i'm going to go into this color
2:21here called thrash and it's just a very intense lime green and I'm taking it on
2:26a little blending brush from Ecotools and i'm going to be building this color
2:31into my crease very very slowly i'm gonna be packing it on the outer part of
2:35my eye and then bringing it into my crease and i'm going to be doing this
2:38over and over and over again this look especially requires a lot of blending
2:43and just going back and forth into that eyeshadow and building it up to the
2:47intensity that you prefer so i'm going to be doing that i'm also going to be
2:52dragging it up past my crease a little bit just to let everything is nice and
2:56blended and it's not a harsh straight line
2:59just take your time with this and build up that green color little by little
3:08yeah
3:13yeah
3:16I'm gonna go back into that eyeshadow i use all over my lid and I'm just gonna
3:20add some more to my lid because some of it did get blended away i'm going to be
3:24doing this quite a few times just going back and forth like I said into the
3:28green intensifying the green and then intensifying the litter aided by the way
3:32if you're wondering what I use on my linen in my crease they are the match
3:36shuttles from the kat von d ladybird palette but you can use whichever
3:40eyeshadows you
3:57now on a more precise blending brushes stiff dome brush I'm going to take it
4:04and dip it right into trash and then just apply it right into my crease to
4:08intensify my crease a little bit more really quickly I'm going to tightline
4:16and I'm going to use my Maybelline master drama in midnight master and then
4:22I'm gonna add my wing
4:23every time i do my wing it gets out of focus i know i suck but i just did a
4:27pretty thin wing on top and then did a nice long look I'm going to go back into
4:34the eyeshadow i use all over my lid one more time just to intensify it because
4:39you know some of it did get blended away and i'm going to be focusing it on the
4:42center of my eyelid and towards mightier duct
4:50yeah
4:52yeah
4:53yeah
4:54really quickly I'm going to curl my lashes and use my Too Faced better than
4:58sex mascara policies would be more ideal for this look but you guys know I don't
5:02really use falsies that much I feel free to use them
5:06I'm going to prime my face with the Maybelline Baby skin and then i'm going
5:09to go in with my foundation it is the most statement I use this like crazy
5:13it's honestly one of my favorite drugstore foundations it's just so easy
5:17to apply and i love that Lucy texture so I'm going to be applying this all over
5:22my face
5:30yeah
5:39yeah
5:40yeah
5:42friends my eyes I'm gonna use Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade fair and
5:47i'm going to highlight with this as well i'm going to be blending that in with my
5:55Real Techniques contour brush
6:08to finish off my eye makeup i'm gonna go in with this urban decay eyeliner in the
6:13shade main line which is a really beautiful matte teal color and then i'm
6:17going to be taking the brush that comes with the electric palette and I'm gonna
6:22dip it into the shape gonzo and I am just going to smudge this on my lower
6:26lashline then I'm just going to blend it out with a pencil brush so it's not too
6:36harsh and it's nice and seamless the mascara i'm gonna be using car bottom
6:42lashes is the clinic bottom lash mascara to set my foundation i am using my Mac
6:52msf natural in medium and I'm taking it on my ELF kabuki brush and I'm just
6:56going to lightly dust this all over my face to set my under eye can see there

7:36cosmetics blush brush and I'm just gonna add just a touch of this on my cheeks my
7:45lips i am taking this lipstick by Mac called salute and it was limited edition
7:49but just take any light peachy shade you have I'm dabbing it on my lips because

8:07makeup look I really hope you enjoyed this video thank you so much for
8:10watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my
8:14next video
0:28hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial using the brand new
0:34Urban Decay electric palette which looks like oh well I don't know that was
0:47totally unnecessary
0:48I know anyway this isn't a full-face makeup tutorial just because i didn't
0:52want the video to be so long since at the end of the video I'm going to be
0:56doing a quick review on this and join us watches and what I think of the palette
1:01so I didn't want to go into a full face of makeup and then do a review and have
1:05this video be like 30 minutes long
1:07I'm not rested today so yeah you want to see swatches and my thoughts about this
1:13pilot just stay tuned to the end of the video but if you want to see how to get
1:17this look then just keep on watching
1:19oh I'll show you like my lip combo to though
1:22yeah keep watchin so the first thing I'm going to do is take my little rock
1:27behind the scenes eye primer and this is what i'm going to use to prime my lids
1:30and then i'm taking a lot of it underneath my eyes because i am putting
1:34a lot of eye shadows underneath my eyes
1:37I'm just going to take my NYC sunny bronzer and i'm going to use
1:40a little crease brush and I'm going to add this to my lid just to add some
1:44color to my eyelid
1:45so I'm focusing that on my outer V and then bring it into my crease
1:49I'm just going to continue to do this until I have the intensity that I want
1:54and I'm also going to be taking it a little bit past the crease as well
2:00ok
2:02yeah
2:05now i'm going to take this color called chaos from the palette
2:08and only small little angled brush I'm going to be adding some fixed plus and
2:12then dipping into the eye shadow and then i'm going to be using this kind of
2:16like gel eyeliner and I'm going to be creating a pretty thick wing with this i
2:21recommend dipping your brush into the powder first and then adding fix plus
2:26because this is a matte eyeshadow and it can get a little bit chunky if you add
2:29water to it so i recommend adding the pics + after you dip it into the shadow
2:39yeah
2:41so before i continue on with the wing really quick i'm gonna add some eyeliner
2:44this is the Urban Decay eyeliner in the color chaos and i'm using this to tight
2:50line and i'm also going to be adding this to my waterline as well
2:59ok so going back in to the chaos color i'm adding a little bit more fixed plus
3:032 just intensify it a bit and I'm going to be adding a thick wing and i suck at
3:08recording this because i always get out of focus and it's just a big hot mess
3:12but just add your wing just like you were adding gel eyeliner
3:18yeah
3:20kinda just went back into my bronzer and i added some more into my crease just to
3:24intensify it a little bit to give myself a little bit more color for my highlight
3:27I'm using the elf baked eye liner in moonlight and pressure is called
3:32moonstone when I don't know i have it down below and i am using this in my
3:36inner corner and underneath my brow bone as well i'm going to take the brush that
3:43came with the palette and I'm going to be dipping it into the color chaos and
3:47running that underneath my lower lash line but staying on the outer half of my
3:51I kind of stopping where the pupil is
3:54and by the way I didn't add any fixed plus to this part
4:04then going into this shade right here called gonzo i'm going to be taking it
4:07on the same brush and then adding it in the center of my lower lash line and
4:11then bring all the way towards my inner tear duct just to kind of have it fade
4:15from the light blue to the cold ball blue
4:19yeah
4:25then I'm going to flip the brush around and with no additional product I'm just
4:28gonna be blending on these colors just to make it a little bit more seamless
4:36then with that same brush I'm going to be putting it back into the gonzo shade
4:40and adding some more just to smoke it out and make it look like really blown
4:44out underneath the lower lash line
4:50and
4:53then take this color here called revolt and i'm just going to add this
4:57- my little tear duct area just to give it some pizzazz
5:01add some glitter and some I don't know you know yeah I don't know just for fun
5:06again i'm going to be using two different mascara i am using the
5:09maybelline colossal volume Express and the Maybelline rocket volume Express are
5:15also going to be using the rocket on my lower lash line as well
5:22for my lips I'm going to take maxima gentle lip liner and i'm going to fill
5:29in my lips with this which is a really nice and vibrant
5:32pinky purple
5:37yeah
5:38for my lipstick i am using the wet and wild my class lipstick and don't blink
5:42pink
5:46yeah
5:47and for my lip gloss i'm using the revlon colorburst lip gloss and adorned
5:51and that is it for this tutorial i hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for
5:56watching
5:57ok guys so basically i think this palette is phenomenal
6:03like it's absolutely amazing first of all i'm just going to talk about the
6:07packaging for a second because the packaging is incredible like is it
6:13they did such a good job with this packaging
6:16it's like a bunch of colorful smoke all over the palate and it's great and it's
6:21dirty and it's i am a mistake by the way so excuse the voice but it's sturdy and
6:27it's so durable I feel like like I feel like it's pretty durable and it comes
6:34with a gigantic mirror like seriously this mirror is so big it's great they
6:40love it
6:41now talking about the actual product these things are so intense
6:46these aren't just your basic eye shadows by the way these are pressed pigment so
6:50they aren't just your basic regular eye shadows there are 10 times more
6:54pigmented because they are pressed pigments
6:57so you're definitely getting amazing color payoff with this palette every
7:01single eyeshadow has fantastic color payoff everything what the pilot also
7:06comes with a double ended brush and it is actually really cute it's black and
7:11the bristles are purple
7:14so cute i use this throughout the entire tutorial in this video and i love it
7:18like I think it's a great great brush I see myself reaching for a lot even packs
7:23on color onto your lid beautifully
7:26people have been freaking out because there's a disclaimer on the packaging or
7:30on the box that some of these pigments in this palette are not used for your
7:35immediate I area and it is these 4 i'm pretty sure it's slow burn Savage
7:42urban and tilted the reddish the pink and the purple they say it's not for
7:47your immediate area but honestly that's very typical for pigments I've heard
7:51that so many times when it comes to pigments
7:54so when i read that it did
7:55really bother me I guess people just didn't realize that that was the case
7:59for some pigments
8:00I had never read it on any packaging but i've heard people like a mac tell me
8:04that so I mean it's no big deal if you are a little bit afraid
8:09just don't put them on like your waterline or anything like that but
8:12honestly I don't think your eyes will get irritated from it
8:15everybody has different skin so it will take my word for it but I used it on my
8:20eyes and i've used the Pink's on my eyes before and I haven't had any irritation
8:24personally and mom about sensitive skin so I mean I've been doing I've been
8:30going pretty fine with these i'm going to quickly swatch all of the colors on
8:34my arm so you can see how great and pigmented these things are ok so this is
8:40the most Awkward swatching i have ever done
8:44what possessed me to put them on the side of my arm
8:47no idea let's just roll that these are the colors look like they're insanely
8:52pigmented being pressed pigment of course this one is revolt it is a very
8:56intense shiny silvery color it does have a little bit of glitter in it like
9:01chunks of glitter but if you want this eyeshadow
9:04it goes on like liquid metal seriously it's not what right now this is how it
9:09normally swatches and it's still like gorgeous love it
9:14this one is gonzo right here it's a beautiful blue
9:17this one here is called slow burn and it is my second favorite color in the
9:20palette absolutely love it it's beautiful
9:23this one is your typical hot hot pink and this one is called savage and this
9:28one is matt this one has a little bit of glitter in it but like barely noticeable
9:33it definitely comes out Matt on your eyelid this right here is called fringe
9:37and it is a metallic teal type of color and it is seriously stunning on the lid
9:43this one is your typical cobalt blue and it is called chaos
9:47this one right here is called jilted it's also one of my favorites because it
9:50has a good dual chrome effect
9:52it looks pink
9:53and it looks purple in certain angles it's amazing
9:57this one right here is a nice deep purple and it is called urban this one
10:02right here it is called freak and it is just like an intense minty sort of minty
10:09green color and then this one is my absolute favorite one of the entire
10:14palette and it is called thrash and it is just like an intense lime green it's
10:19not even picking up how intense this color is in person like oh my god my
10:24favorite favorite favorite favorite
10:25so I hope this awkward angle of swatching helped you in some way
10:31by the way i do recommend using these colors with a primer underneath
10:36even though they are so intensely pigmented definitely use a primer
10:39because if you don't it will stay in your eyes like you put the pink on
10:43trying to get off and you're like oh god they're still pink on my lid
10:47so definitely is a primary want to use a primer there is no staining
10:51at least I don't detect any staining also if you want I shadows to be super
10:55super intense i recommend using a white base and now we'll just make them look
10:59crazy
11:01so anyway I hope you enjoyed this tutorial thank you so much for watching
0:16hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here
0:23I wanted to do something blue because i was really inspired by this palette
0:28right here this is the morphe 35o d
0:31I know that everybody's using the 3500 palette right now which is calling my
0:37name because it's full of oranges and those are my favorite kinds of colors
0:41but i thought you know what I'm going to step out of my comfort zone
0:44I'm not going to do an orange smokey eye today I'm going to do a blue one so I
0:48just focused on me blue colors in this palette this is a very pigmented palette
0:52pretty freaking amazing
0:54i will link it down below if you're interested so yes I think it's really
0:59pretty sometimes blue scared me and sometimes I feel like I can't pull it
1:02off but decided to run with it and if you want to see how to get this look
1:06then just keep watching
1:07ok so i've already primed my eyes with my Mac 24 hour extended I base and i did
1:13go into this palette as well not just the morphe palette this is the to face
1:18naturally matte palette because the morphe one lacks crease shade and stuff
1:23like that so i just applied that vanilla color on my entire lid - set the primer
1:27and now i'm going in with this one I believe it was called kashmir bunny on a
1:31fluffy brush and that's going to be my transition shade then I'm taking that
1:35really intense blue in the palette now this one does work a lot better with
1:39fix+ so I just sprayed some fixed plus on my brush this is an elf brush and I
1:45dipped it back into the eye shadow and then apply it like that onto my lid
1:50and so it can be really really really intense and frosty
1:55now i'm gonna take this matt navy blue and on this little pencil brush i'm just
1:59going to start applying this into my crease
2:02now this looks looks a little messy and sloppy before it looks good so you know
2:06just take your time with it I'm just putting this into my crease back and
2:10forth and trying to blend the shimmery blue with the matte blue then I'm going
2:15into this color called honey butter this is in the to face palette and on a
2:19fluffy crease brush
2:20I am just trying to blend out the harsh lines and then I'm going to do the same
2:23thing with chocolate crap just trying to blend everything into the crease this
2:28look requires a lot a lot of blending and I'm gonna go back into that blue i'm
2:34not going to spray fix+ but i'm just going to intensify the little bit more
2:38since you blend so much a lot of it does get blended away
2:42now i'm going into this other shimmery maybe blue the other one was like a mad
2:45navy blue this one's a shimmery one and i'm doing the same thing I did with the
2:49navy blue
2:51just make sure everything is nice and blended all the crease colors fade into
2:55each other back again with cashmere bunny and I am just further blending
3:00possible ending little living
3:03I'm gonna take this coastal scents brush and this matte black in the palette and
3:08I'm going to start packing this on the outer corners
3:10I want the drama to be like on the outer corner of the lid i wanted to go from
3:13like black to blue
3:15I'm just packing on that black and I guess I forgot I was filming tutorial
3:22but i just put that middle shade under my brow bone the same one I used on my
3:27lid ok so moving onto my face before I finish my eyes I am priming my face with
3:31the rebecca black light filter primarily this was called I'm obsessed with this I
3:35think it's amazing
3:37then I went in with the Loreal infallible Pro matte foundation in shell
3:41beige
3:42I will
3:42in this the number i have and i'm using this with a real techniques complexion
3:47sponge and I am just bouncing that on my whole face
3:50I love this foundation but i do need to use a very illuminating primer and a
3:53sponge with it because if not it looks too dry and cakey then underneath my
3:59eyes I decided to use my NARS creamy rating concealer i haven't used it in a
4:02hot minute so I'm using vanilla underneath my eyes and I'm also
4:06highlighting with this and I'm just blending everything out with the same
4:11real techniques sponge
4:17now i'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent setting powder and i'm just
4:21going to set my under eye concealer
4:24so moving onto my face again I mean my eyes
4:27this is max nylon eyeshadow it's a really intense color so i use that in my
4:31inner corners then I'm going to take this tart tart 'used gel liner cream
4:36liner thing and this is a little sigma brush and I'm taking this liner all the
4:41way into my inner corners like my inner tear duct as you can see and I'm
4:44dragging that on my waterline
4:46so not only am i doing a wing with this but I'm going to put it in my inner
4:49corners like a cat I Egyptian kind of effect and on my waterline and then I'm
4:54just going to do a little flick and this is the Too Faced better than sex mascara
4:58and for my bottom lashes I wanted a blue color I thought it would look really
5:02cool
5:03so this is the they're real mascara by benefit in their blue shade and its
5:06really really cool i like how it turned out I think it's different
5:09I didn't put any eyeshadow on my lower lashes just for a little bit of a change
5:12and then I put on some falsies those were the morphe demi wispies so to
5:18contour me to do a soft contour with my girl lactic Kabul bronzer
5:22this is a morph e.g something brush from the gun metal collection it's their
5:26powder brush and I'm just using this brush because it does apply a soft
5:30amount like a light amount of product so I'm just contouring and bronzing with
5:34that
5:35for my highlight i am using color pops wisp highlight
5:39it's beautiful and I love applying this with a sponge i can apply it with a
5:43synthetic brush too but i really like how the sponge applies it
5:50i'm also highlighting my nose
5:54you know ok so for blush I'm using the clinique nude pop blush pop
6:14for my lips I'm taking color pops lip liner in BFF and i'm just going to line
6:20my entire lips with this like all over the place all over my lips and then I'm
6:24just going to top it off with the NARS lip gloss in the shade
6:27Chelsea girls 10 girls and then that completes this look I really hope you
6:33guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't
6:37already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:11hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here
0:16I love these kind of looks where it's like gray eyes and great lips I know
0:20that's like a very big trend
0:22I wanted to do a makeup tutorial surrounding the Anasazi liquid lipstick
0:25in sepia
0:27it looks so much darker on me that it doesn't everyone else I feel but it's
0:31okay i like it and i used mostly the Kat Von D shade and light palette
0:36I really love these type of looks where you match like eyes and lips together
0:39especially these gray tones and it's kind of weird for me to do this because
0:42i don't have mascara on my lower lash line
0:45I always smoked out my lower lashes and put on mascara and I didn't do that for
0:49today's video i wanted to switch it up and I don't know I don't know anyway if
0:54you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
0:57so the first thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids as usual this is Mac's
1:02painterly Paint Pot and I'm bluffing that out with a zoe book concealer brush
1:07now i'm going to go into the Kat Von D shade and light palette and I'm taking
1:10this whitish kind of color i don't have the palate with me because it's in
1:14storage at the moment but i'm just going to walk you through the colors this is
1:18like a whiter shade and I just set that bass down
1:22this is a Luxy crease brush and I'm applying that really really really light
1:27bone beige like grayish color and i'm applying this into my crease as my
1:31transition shade
1:32now i'm taking max copper plates eyeshadow it's just a neutral gray and
1:37this is a morphe brush
1:39and i'm just applying this on the outer corners of my really close to that tape
1:44and slightly bringing it in
1:46like slowly bringing in it I'm going to take this dark great in the palette with
1:50that same brush and I'm just going to do the exact same thing
1:53I'm just taking a bunch of great tone eyeshadow and creating like a gradient
1:58effect from the tape going to my inner corners so that's what I'm doing again
2:03same thing you know packing it on the outer corners and bringing it in slowly
2:07now i'm going into the black of the palette and on a different more dense
2:11precise brush
2:12I am packing this really really really close to the tape
2:16I want the black to just be focused on the very outer like corners like the cat
2:20eye shape that effect
2:22so I'm packing that black really close to the tape as adjusted
2:27then I'm going to take that same color use first and i'm just applying this to
2:31my in your corners so that it could just look a little bit brighter on my lid and
2:36then i'm applying that to my brow bone and in my tear duct as well just to
2:40highlight those parts in my eyes
2:42I have a cold by the way if you can tell i use that nyx eyeliner or use it like
2:48every tutorial it's my favorite from the drugstore and I tight line and what and
2:52added that to my waterline and then I just use my makeup forever graphic liner
2:56to create a very very small wing to prime my face i use the backup backlight
3:01primer and then for foundation
3:04i am using the urban decay naked skin foundation and i'm using it on a cover
3:08effects custom foundation brush so I'm just popping in this brush is really
3:13really cool it's so incredibly dense so it gives you really good coverage like
3:18it doesn't drink up
3:20barely any of the foundation it's pretty cool i really get so I'm just noting
3:24that in too much
3:29so I'm adding concealer underneath my eyes now and this is the Maybelline
3:33instant age rewind dark circle eraser and then in the shade fair i believe and
3:38i'm just applying that underneath my eyes and then blending that in but
3:41you've seen me blend this about a million times so let's just skip over
3:44them to set my concealer i'm using the laura mercier translucent setting powder
3:49and this is a real techniques setting brush
3:55and then I just plopped on some mascara i left my lower lashes bear that might
3:58seem really weird for some people but I thought it was cool and different so I
4:02applied my Too Faced better than sex mascara and now i'm going to contour
4:06very very slightly and very naturally with the a cosmetics contour kit and I
4:12use that shade in the middle and I'm just slightly contouring with this
4:16I don't want anything too heavy
4:24for blush I'm using one of my favorite blushes during this time like this time
4:28of year and it's tart expose the blush and i'm using this on a blush brush from
4:33morphe from their gun metal collection now to highlight I'm using the overflow
4:38shimmering strips in the shade illuminating and i'm using that very
4:42very top strip to highlight my face out my phone , texas to highlight my face
4:48and I'm using this on an M 501 brush my morphe and then to finish off my look

1:46instead of the healthy mix serum it's a different kind of foundation but i
1:51really like it's not as do ii as a serum and it has a little bit more coverage

8:22already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:27hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm
0:34wearing right now it is a very warm look and i know that i do warm looks all the
0:39time on my channel
0:40they're my favorite looks to do especially in the summertime i love
0:44really warm bronzy looks but this look is a little bit different because I
0:48paired it with a bold lip and usually i pair my smoky eyes with nude lips you
0:52can definitely do this look and then pair it with a nude lip if you're more
0:55comfortable with that I know this is a little bit loud for some people wanted
0:58to do something different in terms of my lips usually my tutorials always end up
1:02with no lips so I wanted to change it up the slip i think it's so summery because
1:06it's a red neon lit but it has a little bit of orange undertone and it's so
1:10pretty i love it
1:11for those of you who are sick of all my warm tutorials don't worry i'm planning
1:14on doing a lot of tutorials with the lorac Pro palette 2 a little bit more
1:19cool toned looks though yeah i really hope you guys like this look and if you
1:24want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
1:27so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to prime my eyelids i am using
1:30my LA girl Pro conceal primer no concealer no primer i'm using this to
1:35prime my eyes because it is a full coverage product and it's just going to
1:38cover up all the redness and beans on my lids now I'm going to take my makeup
1:44eyeshadow in the shape peach smoothie and on a more feed fluffy brush I'm just
1:49going above this into my crease and just pretty much put it everywhere because
1:52it's gonna be my transition chain and it's going to give it a beautiful peach
1:55look now I'm going to take makeup geeks creme brulee and on a smaller blending
2:00brush I'm going to be doing the exact same thing only
2:03I'm not going to be too messy was it i'm going to be a little bit more precise
2:06and adding this directly in my crease and on the outer half of my eye
2:12yeah
2:18now i'm just going to take a warm orange shade this is just an orange eyeshadow
2:22in my naturally pretty palette from it cosmetics and on my mac 217 i'm going to
2:26be very very precise with this color a little bit more precise and creme brulee
2:30and i'm going to be putting this pretty much just like the hollow of my crease
2:34and on the outer be of my eye as well
2:48next I'm going to take my tart Park Avenue princess bronzer this and stab
2:52myself in the eye
2:53this is the shimmery one and i'm just going to pack this on my entire lid
2:56honestly any shimmery bronzer will do you can even skip this step I just
3:01wanted to add a little bit more dimension to the center of the lid since
3:04most of the colors are in the crease and the outer V of the eye but you don't
3:08have to do this step now I'm going to take mocha by makeup geek and it's a
3:15beautiful dark brown color I love this eyeshadow and on a flat shader brush i'm
3:20just going to be applying this really really close to my top lashes to kind of
3:24make like a very subtle eyeliner look I wanted to look deeper and like chocolate
3:30here towards the eyelashes and make it blown out towards the crease if that
3:35makes any sense really quickly I'm going to move on to the rest of my face before
3:39I finish my eyes I'm going to use my tart primed and poreless primer and I'm
3:43gonna put this all over my face
3:46well on the areas where I want to cover up my pores or to hide them or global or
3:50whatever
3:51now i'm using my revlon colorstay foundation into 5240 fresh i don't i
3:58don't exactly remember i will put it in the description box and this foundation
4:02is darker than my face but it matches the rest of my body so I am self tanning
4:06at the moment so that's why my faces a little bit wider than the rest of my
4:10body I'm going to use my boo cover up concealer and i'm going to use this to
4:15cover up my dark circles and to highlight my face as well
4:21I'm just blending that out with my Real Techniques contour brush
4:33yeah
4:39now i'm going to use macs emphasize powder and on my ELF tapered brush I'm
4:45just gonna pack that underneath my lashes to set my concealer underneath my
4:50lashes no no underneath my eyes to set my under eye concealer and set the rest
4:57of my concealer as well moving back to the eyes i'm just going to take mocha
5:03again into the exact same thing i did earlier only making it a little bit
5:06darker this time and then i'm going to sweep my brush back and forth just to
5:12blend it out and it can look kind of like a sunset there goes darker to
5:15lighter
5:19now i'm going to be using my milani shadow eyes and I'm gonna use this to
5:22run it on the waterline and then i'm going to go in with Max no makeup geeks
5:29is wrong created a makeup geeks creme brulee and i'm just going to apply this
5:34underneath my lashes and really really blow it out i'm going to smoke it out i
5:37wanted to look very very smoky on the lower lash line and I'm gonna take mocha
5:41again and i'm going to set that cream product i put in my waterline now I have
5:46been putting a shadow in my waterline for years and years and years and years
5:50and it's never irritated by I don't have sensitive eyes but if you have sensitive
5:53eyes and don't do this but I'm just gonna set that so it kind of makes like
5:58a nice brown eyeliner and the powder is just going to make it set and stay all
6:04day now i'm going to go in with this milani eyeshadow in the shade fellowship
6:09on and i'm going to apply this underneath my brow bone it is the most
6:12beautiful color has a gold undertone and I'm going to put this in my inner tear
6:17duct as well i'm applying some mascara to my bottom lashes and i'm getting them
6:23really really good because I want them to be very very like voluminous on my
6:27bottom lashes and i am using my Elizabeth mock it's so big mascara and
6:31then i'm going to apply some to the top lashes as well because i will be going
6:34in with some falsies i'm using my red cherry 747 ends and then i am going to
6:39apply them to my lashes so finishing off with my face i'm using my NARS Laguna
6:43bronzer on my ELF complexion brush and I'm just gonna be warming up my face I'm
6:48not adding blush so I want my face to be very very warm and bronzy but I'm really
6:52focusing this bronzer on my cheekbones I want it to be like very intense on my
6:59cheeks and you can see not like very intense but I want them to stand out my
7:04cheekbones so i'm applying a lot of the bronzer there
7:10now i'm gonna add my highlight and i'm using my Sigma contours to add it and
7:16I'm taking my fellowship on eyeshadow again and I'm going to use this as a
7:19base highlight this is so amazing to highlight your cheekbones because of
7:23that gold undertone almost goddess is so beautiful and the goddess like in
7:27summary i love it so much like my new favorite highlighter now it's so
7:31beautiful so that is what i'm doing and i'm going to take it on the bridge of my
7:34nose and on my upper lip and you know all the beautiful closest so for my lips
7:41the coolest part of this tutorial i am taking my milani anti feathering the
7:46pencil thing and I'm gonna put that on my lips and then I'm going to add some
7:50concealer to my lips so that the lip color will look more true to its color
7:55because my lips are very pigmented so the color that's on my lips is the lime
8:00crime Velveteen and suede very this stuff is no joke it's a beautiful hot
8:05neon orange II read it comes off more neon in person like a lot more neon and
8:10person it's just absolutely beautiful and it lasts all day on the lips i
8:14seriously had to get like makeup remover to take this off my lips because like
8:18cement on your face it's great if you want something that will last all day so
8:23that is the finished look guys I really hope you enjoyed this video thank you
8:27guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and
8:29I'll see you next time
0:11hey guys so today's video is going to be a prompt tutorial and i know that a
0:16couple of you guys have already had your prom and I'm so sorry I'm super late but
0:21I know some of you haven't had your prompt so
0:24better late than never hopefully so yeah let's get started I'm going to be using
0:28my Too Faced shadow insurance to prime my eyes
0:31this one keeps my action on for a really long time so it's pretty crucial for
0:35prom
0:36i'm going to add a face so that my eyeshadows can stand out a little bit
0:39more and i'm using the Milani shadow I in golden bronze
0:43I'm going to go into this eyeshadow from Mac called naked lunch and a flat shader
0:49brush I'm going to apply this to my entire lid
0:53I'm a little sick guys a number of the recipe I'm going to take some tape and
0:57apply that to the side of my eye to create a nice cat eye effect and then
1:01i'm going to go into max soft brown and i'm going to love this into my crease
1:05and just working that color back and forth
1:10yeah
1:13yeah
1:17I'm going to go into the shape called copper plate this is also from mac and
1:20i'm going to be doing the exact same thing I actually like how these two
1:23colors look together
1:25there's something about the cool tone and deform tones that I think look
1:28really nicely paired together then taking a dark chocolatey shade this is
1:33brown down from Mac I'm just going to build this color slowly onto my outer be
1:38and just drag it into my crease and a little bit on my lid as well
1:43this I look does take a lot of blending so you just want to go back and forth
1:48with the eyeshadow just apply a little by little and not get too heavy handed
1:52with it
1:57yeah
1:58then I'm going to take this pigment from makeup geek it is called a stir well and
2:02it's absolutely amazing and a flat shader brush I'm going to apply this on
2:06to the center of my lid dragging it towards my inner tear duct I'm just
2:16going to take any matte black eyeshadow and i'm going to be doing the exact same
2:19thing I did with the chocolate brown color only focusing the black a little
2:24bit more towards the tape and not so much on my entire is that makes any
2:28sense
2:28just dragging that a little bit into my crease but focusing most of the black
2:33color right at the tape so that it does have a nice transition
2:38I'm gonna take this gel eyeliner from Maybelline this one lasts a really long
2:43time on my island that's why it would be perfect for prom and then I'm just going
2:47to add a thin line
2:49I don't want anything too thick so that it doesn't overpower my entire I and
2:54don't worry about a perfect little wing because the tape does act as a perfect
2:59little guide so that you don't mess up then I'm just going to go back into the
3:02black eyeshadow and just intensify the black a little bit more packing most of
3:08the black
3:09like I said towards the tape and I'm just going to take the tape off and then
3:14I'm going to go into max shroom
3:16and i'm going to use this as my inner corner highlight
3:19yeah
3:21underneath my brow bone i am just taking a random white matte eyeshadow and
3:27applying this underneath my brow bone
3:30i'm going to be doing my eyebrows next and I like priming my eyebrows with
3:34eyeshadow primer when I want them to last all day which is what you would
3:39want for prom
3:40I have an entire eyebrow tutorial that i will link down below if you're
3:43interested
3:44is this would take way too much time I'm gonna move on to the rest of my face and
3:49Prime with my Maybelline Baby skin applying it on the places where I think
3:53I needed the most
3:55I'm going to take a photo friendly foundation
3:58mine is the urban decay naked skin this has no SPF so it looks amazing in
4:03pictures which is ideal for prom and i'm just going to buff this all over my face
4:09using a Real Techniques buffing brush
4:13yeah
4:30next I'm going to conceal my under eyes and I recommend using a full coverage
4:34long-lasting can see their mind would be the mac pro longwear it last
4:41literally all day and it is full coverage but when I want to go film this
4:45tutorial it was nowhere to be found so I'm just using the Maybelline fit me
4:49concealer just for the sake of this video but i definitely recommend one
4:53that will last all night long and it is pretty good coverage and my program
4:58where is perfect for that but this will do for the sake of this video and I'm
5:02just buffing that out with the Real Techniques contour brush
5:12yeah
5:19i'm going to set everything on my face using my Mac msf natural and shade
5:23medium
5:23I love this powder because it is very finely milled and it does not look cakey
5:28on the skin whatsoever
5:30so you're not going to look like you have a lot of powder on your face
5:37and to set my under eye can see there i'm using this powder called emphasize
5:41is also for mac I'm sorry and I'm using like a lot of mac in this video I don't
5:47know I didn't even realize it while I was filming but i'm just going to set my
5:50under eye concealer with this powder then to finish off my eyes
5:53I'm going to take a q-tip and run that on my waterline just take out any of the
5:57excess oils and the pencil that i'm using right here will last a lot longer
6:01i'm using my chela I release highlighter
6:04this is just going to open up the eyes your eyes don't look really really small
6:08or harsh which is what putting black on your waterline tends to do then I'm just
6:13going to take that brown color and apply it to my lower lash line and then with a
6:17pencil brush i'm just going to buff it all out so it looks nice and smoky
6:22I'm going to use my clinic bottom lash mascara this makes my bottom lashes look
6:27nice and dramatic which is what i want for prom and then I'm going to be adding
6:31falsies next
6:32so I'm just going to apply a very thin coat of mascara using be enabling rocket
6:37volume Express the false is amusing are the arts all natural demi wispies these
6:42are my favorite ones even though i am not a fall / where you guys know this
6:46but those are my favorite ones when I do wear false lashes
6:49I'm going to take my benefit through the bronzer and my Sigma contour brush and
6:54I'm going to contour my cheekbones with this bronzer i definitely recommend
6:58contouring for prom especially because I just gives shape and dimension to your
7:03face and it looks nicer in photos
7:06- I'm just going to contour my cheekbones my temples my forehead
7:13a little bit on the sides of my nose and then I'm going to take my NARS Laguna
7:18bronzer and on a bigger brush and I'm just going to bronze up my face a little
7:22bit more just to give more color to my face
7:29yeah
7:35then I'm gonna take that onto my chest as well just a little bit more bronze
7:39and glowy the blush I'm using is this one by nicks and it is called mall and I
7:45love this blush i think it complements so many different looks and I'm going to
7:50be applying that with my it cosmetics blush brush the highlight I'm using is
7:57this 1 by L and it is called blush gems and i'm just an added to the tops of my
8:01cheekbones and on the bridge of my nose
8:05sorry and on my Cupid's bow a little bit
8:12I'm gonna do a nude lip but i'm going to do a more brownie darker nude lip
8:18this is what a wild bear it all and i'm going to do a darker nude because very
8:24pale nude tend to look white in flash photography so you don't want to look
8:28like you have no slips at prom huh
8:30and then I'm just going to take my buxom white russian lip gloss and apply this
8:36on top
8:37I love this lip gloss because it lasts a really really long time on my lips and
8:41it does give up a beautiful glossy finish
8:44so it is perfect for plum that completes this makeup tutorial i hope you guys

2:39blend and buff everything else focusing
2:43it really really close to my lashes and
2:45then dragging it up and buffing it out i
2:47use my concealer to prime my eyelids

3:00that into the crease

3:07but that is the look we're going for
3:09it's a very messy smoky daytime look I
3:14mean you could totally wear this in the
3:15nighttime as well this is definitely not
3:17something that's just for the daytime
3:26now i'm going to go in with a clean
3:28blending brush this is the morphe 23 i'm
3:31going to buff out those edges i do not
3:34want too much pigmentation here in the
3:37crease
3:41now i'm going to take the shade zoo
3:44right here which is a very very warm
3:46almost red-brown i'm going to take the
3:48morphe thirteen brush I know that these
3:51are discontinued but i know so many of
3:54you guys have them already and I'm
3:57pretty much just applying this color
3:59really really close to the lashes and
4:01doing the same thing just dragging it up
4:03a little bit but I'm not going to take
4:04it as far as I took the shade burkina
4:16now on an even smaller little fluffy
4:18brush this is the Real Techniques
4:20shading brush I'm going to take this
4:22shay right here called ADA or add up
4:24it's very similar to the shade we just
4:26used but this one is a little bit more
4:29red and I'm going to do the exact same
4:31thing focusing this one even closer to
4:35my lashline and then the other shade so
4:37we're pretty much doing like a gradient
4:39you want your shades to fade from like
4:41darkest to lightest
4:52then I'm gonna go back in with that
4:54fluffy brush we first use and go back
4:56into that first shade we used and I'm
4:58just gonna blend on top of it and I know
5:05it's a little bit repetitive but we're
5:07going to do the exact same thing all
5:08over again i'm going to apply the shade
5:11Zulu once more on my lid there is a
5:15little bit of fallout with this palette
5:17as well as you can see there's kind of
5:19like some brown eyeshadow underneath
5:21which is why I always always do my
5:24eyeshadow first sometimes I'll do my
5:26face makeup first like today but i
5:28always recommend doing eyeshadow first
5:31and then i'm going to go back into the
5:32shada with the same brush and do the
5:35same thing for some reason a lot of
5:39people always tell me like why is your
5:41eye makeup before your face you're not
5:43supposed to do that you're supposed to
5:45do your face makeup first and I don't
5:47get why people get so upset about it
5:48like where is the handbook tell me where
5:50its sense that I have to do my face
5:52makeup first please tell me it's just
5:54personal preference doesn't mean you're
5:57doing it right or doing it out of order
5:59do your makeup the way you want to if
6:00you want to draw on one eyebrows and do
6:02your whole face and then draw this one
6:04who says you can I like to put on my
6:06makeup first because i like to avoid the
6:09fallout on my own foundation
6:11ok so i am going to go back in with a
6:12few more eyeshadows in a second but I
6:14want to work on my lower lashline i'm
6:16going to use the exact same shade i
6:18already use on my top lid gonna take
6:20burkina first I have no idea if I'm
6:22pronouncing that work correctly doesn't
6:24sound like i am i'm going to apply it
6:26using this urban decay brush number eat
6:28208
6:32then I'm going to take the shade Zulu
6:37followed by a little bit of ADA i'm
6:39going to use the Luxy 217 brush to
6:42smudge both of these out dippin into a
6:50dup data and getting really really
6:53really close with this shade
7:00I love looks like this because they
7:02really take no skill and even though
7:04they look a little crazy weird now with
7:07eyeliner or a ton of mascara it just
7:09looks like edgy and smoky and it was
7:12like the easiest i would ever
7:17now i'm going to take the colour-pop
7:20crumb gel liner in the shade mr. Bing i
7:23love this eyeliner it just intensifies
7:25any brown smokey eye and I just love how
7:28it makes green eyes look even brown eyes
7:30I feel like mr. being emphasizes like
7:33the golden tones in your eyes if you
7:35have brown eyes
7:36awesome for blue eyes as well gonna play
7:40a little
7:49so the look in my September favorites
7:52video wasn't as red as it is now I did
7:55apply some more brown colors so I took
7:58the shape fulani say that
8:01rambla not fulani for LAN Jie and on
8:05this same Real Techniques brush I'm
8:07going to apply that really really close
8:09I'm also going to put that on my little
8:14girl Ashley
8:19then I thought okay I want to even a
8:22little bit less red because i really
8:24wanted to match my lip color but I don't
8:26want to clash so on this little brush
8:28this is the wave of 237 brush i took
8:32this eyeshadow this is the make up for
8:33ever and 618 but any dark brown
8:37eyeshadow you have in your collection i
8:38know you have one that will work taking
8:40a bit of this and smudging that super
8:43close to the lashes like super-close
8:46because this I shot up his and dent
9:01now i'm going to take this shade right
9:03here called Giza and on this milani
9:06crease brush I'm going to put that on my
9:08inner corners for my brow bone highlight
9:13because the masquerade pilot doesn't
9:15really have a very very light satin
9:18color I'm going to take my essence pure
9:20nude highlight which I'm gonna end up
9:22using on my face and I'm taking the
9:24morphe am 210 brush and I'm going to use
9:27this to highlight my browbone i'm giving
9:35my eyelashes a really good curl because
9:37i am not applying eyeliner or false
9:41lashes so I really want my mascara to
9:43stand out this is the tweezerman eyelash

10:00that is it can get a little bit clumpy
10:01if you use too much what I like to do
10:04when my eyelashes start to stick
10:06together is I'll take this i love this
10:08is like my little trustee guy this is
10:11the morphe beat 71 and I'll just comb
10:14through my eyelashes and it really does
10:19a good job of getting rid of those clubs
10:20so I'm just going to apply mascara to
10:23the rest of my lashes and i will be
10:25right back to finish my face
10:27ok so now we're completely done with the
10:29eyes so so so so easy now I'm going to
10:32contour my face a little bit i know in
10:34my favorites video i was wearing the
10:35coming of Quan sculpting powder in light

11:20I'm not gonna give any spoilers I hope I
11:23don't lose interest in it the way that I
11:25lost interest in scandal
11:26I know no company but i did lose
11:28interest in scandal just because I was
11:30like going back and forth like who does
11:32she love hood and it just it was driving
11:34me nuts so i'm going to take the wet and
11:36wild color icon bronzer in ticket to
11:39Brazil it's a very warm shimmery bronzer
11:42and i'm just going to use this to warm
11:44up the skin a little bit i was also
11:45wearing this in my favorites video using
11:47these wava 90 brush it's like they're
11:50baked powder brush puffed-up helped up
11:56ok so for blush I'm going to use the
12:01bombs blush in the shade Palm Beach this
12:03is a very long wearing blush and i agree
12:06this this like last a long time on my
12:08skin taking my makeup forever 122 brush
12:11it's just a stippling brush I like
12:13stippling brushes for blush like any
12:15stippling brush because i feel like it
12:17applies blush a little bit more
12:19naturally you don't have to make up for
12:21everyone this is like overpriced elf has
12:23a really really nice stippling brush
12:24that I love
12:25morphy Sigma
12:31ok so now i'm going to highlight my face
12:33using the highlight I use underneath my
12:36brow bone the essence . highlighter this
12:39stuff is so affordable and so good it
12:41looks so natural on the skin just going
12:44to apply some of that to the tops of my
12:46cheekbones using these away ba11 for
12:50brush and then before i sat down to fill
13:01my favorites video i popped on a little
13:03bit of this guy right here this is my
13:04makeup geek kathleenlights highlighter
13:06palette
13:07oh i have been using this in my videos
13:08because I don't want to like shove it
13:10down your throat I don't like doing that
13:11too much but I took a little bit of
13:13night light and I put that right at the
13:16top right here like only right there
13:22booth and then i'm also going to take
13:26some of that put it in my inner corners
13:29because I want my inner corners to look
13:30a little bit more golden so yeah this
13:34point you can throw on a nude lip and I
13:36think it would look amazing but since
13:38this is the lip color i was wearing my
13:39favorite video i'm gonna pop this on and
13:41honestly I always tell people who have
13:43green eyes to try to embrace red
13:45lipstick because i think that green eyes
13:48match really well with lipstick the red
13:50really just pulls out the green even
13:52when I wear like red clothing people
13:54compliment how green my eyes look at
13:56know but I'm gonna go in with the kat
13:57von d everlasting liquid lipstick in the
13:59shade project chimps this was limited
14:02edition but a few of you guys told me
14:03it's still available on the kat von d
14:06website and if you do purchase this i
14:08think all proceeds or a portion of the
14:10proceeds go to help the chimps i'm just
14:12going to apply this to my mouth
14:22ok so i just applied to four layers of
14:25this it is a little bit streaky not
14:28streaky it's a little bit thin of a
14:30formula so if you do just 14 layer it
14:33won't be streaky but it'll be a lighter
14:34red I wanted it to be a little bit
14:36darker like this so i did two layers so
14:39yes that completes this makeup look I
14:41think it's so pretty for green eyes or
14:43for any eye color you have whatever your
14:45eye color is I like this look regardless
14:47but if you do have green eyes and you've
14:49been searching for a way to make them
14:50stand out in your makeup i think this is
14:52a good way to go
14:54yes secondly this video and i hope you
14:55guys enjoyed thank you so much for
14:57watching please subscribe if you haven't
14:59already and I will see you in my next
15:00video bye
0:13so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right now
0:18I cut myself cleaning my food processor this morning
0:21so this is the look that I've been wearing a lot recently just not on my
0:24videos because as you guys know I've been pre-recording a lot but I've worn
0:29this look
0:30three times in the past week and that's saying a lot because I like to like
0:33we're different things but honestly I think this look is perfect for fall if
0:38you are a simple gal I think we like to wear like a lot less makeup in the
0:42summer and we really to glam it up in the fall time so I did a little bit more
0:47than i would normally do as an everyday look during the summer this is a lot of
0:51makeup for some people for an everyday look
0:53but I think it's perfect for fall because it's just like a little bit
0:57vampy been natural at the same time i don't know i really like it and it's
1:01something that you can wear all the time and just switch up the lip color you
1:04could do a dark red or brown
1:07mmm i would have had way too much coffee today and I'm like and you can tell
1:14ok so if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
1:17ok so i'm taking my hair out of my face in my little headband here i'm going to
1:22take the Smashbox BB water i'm in the shade light you have to shake it up
1:26first and then i'm applying this to my face
1:28this is a Sephora Pro air brush brush I'm not even sure the name but it was in
1:32that limited edition packaging with the flowers
1:36i'm just applying that to my entire face I skipped primer when i use that because
1:39I find that I don't really need to
1:41this is the Maybelline
1:44what is this called the better skin concealer there you go
1:49I applied that underneath my eyes to highlight and to cover up my circles and
1:54then i apply that to the rest of my face as I normally do this is the sedona lace
1:58217 brush my holy grail concealer brush and I'm just blending all of that in
2:04this is the it cosmetics bye bye pores powder the press version i love this so
2:11I'm just taking the real techniques setting brush and I'm setting my under
2:14eye concealer
2:17yeah
2:23now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm using the Maybelline 24 hour cream
2:27eyeshadow in the shade creamy beige
2:29this came out with like their letters collection but i still see it all the
2:32time and i'm just applying that to my entire lid i just wanted a hint of color
2:37but not something that was really noticeable
2:39I like doing this for like an everyday look and then i'm applying some of that
2:43underneath my lower lashes with this fluffy brush for mascara I'm using this
2:50one by clinic
2:51it's like their chubby fat mascara but this is a red shade like a red color and
2:56I think it's so cool like so nice for a fall because it's a deep primary shade
3:00and you can tell it just gives like a slight hint
3:03you can't unless you look really close but I think it's cool so now to finish
3:07up my face
3:08that's all I do with the eyes I'm using the elf mineral bronzer and i'm going to
3:13use this to contour
3:14I don't exactly remember the name of this brush but it's like a morphy blush
3:19brush
3:20now i'm going to apply some blush this is like a bronzer and blush in one
3:25this is benefits Dallas box powder blush thing it's like a really pretty
3:30mob color it's so nice this time of year I always busted out in the fall time
3:36it's beautiful
3:37so for highlight I'm using Becca's champagne pop and I'm just barely
3:41putting this on the tops of my cheekbones I don't want to look too
3:43glowy
3:44but just a little bit of something something and now i'm moving on to my
3:49lips and this is the star of the show you can change up your lip color for an
3:52everyday because this
3:53I look goes with everything but this is color pops Libby stick in the shade
3:57grunge and then that completes make a book i really hope you guys enjoyed
4:02please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is going to be a top through tutorial kind of excited
0:05to do one because i haven't done one in a while I haven't actually done a
0:07tutorial in a while because you guys know and then painting and I've actually
0:12had to film videos that were super easy to film like just reviews or talking
0:18kind of videos
0:19um let's talk about something really good so I got new lights and actually
0:25like my lighting is completely off in this video I don't know if you guys
0:28could tell it looks bad in the viewfinder and probably looks bad to you
0:32guys
0:32highlighting is completely off because i had told you guys in a previous video
0:36that i had a ring light and then I broke it so i thought that the only thing that
0:40broke with the bowl because the bulb shattered into a million pieces so i
0:44purchased a new bowl
0:46so I want to go put the bulb inside the ring light and it was there and it was
0:49perfect on like a beautiful and i want to plug it in and it didn't work so it
0:54wasn't the bulb something was coming is completely wrong with my ring light
0:58actually called the people i told the situation and I was still under warranty
1:03so i have to send it out tomorrow
1:06they have to have to get it they have to see what's wrong with it
1:10and if there's something wrong that they can't fix they will send me a new one
1:14so that's probably going to take like two weeks that's really like a two-week
1:18process to be honest so i'll probably be filming my videos at nighttime
1:22because it's night time right now which is what I mean it was probably feeling
1:25my videos facing the mirror like I always do until i get my ring light in
1:30the mail because like the lighting is really bad right now but anyway today's
1:34video is going to be a tutorial talk to do and i think i'm just going to do like
1:40a combination of looks I've been wearing in my previous videos I'm going to do
1:44the I look I'm going to use my too faced natural matte palette
1:48this is what it looks like a little bit it's kind of like the look I was wearing
1:52in the review only without the blue and black
1:54to add the blue i'm just going to use this palette and this pellet alone so I
1:58actually going to start out with my face
2:01I never start out of my face but why not much i'm gonna figure out here
2:07by the way there's still an echo in this room like a hardcore echo and I don't
2:13know what else to do i open the window i put a rug I put my friends are in here
2:17maybe two blenders on the other side of the room anyway so I don't exactly know
2:22what to do
2:24I'm still going to get more furniture i have to put in like another furniture
2:27unit in this room
2:28it's because i have hardwood floors in here outside i open up a window to see
2:34if that would help but I don't know if i should get a bigger rug like a more
2:38fluffy rug or just put like a bunch more things on the wall
2:41I don't know i have a mic so i bought a mic for the echo in my last room and
2:48seemed to work but for some reason in this room is just ok so I'm going to
2:52find my face using my favorite primer in the entire world this is the hangover or
2:58xor hangover x4 planishing face primer i love this because it has coconut water
3:03electrolytes probiotics
3:05I really like it because it hydrates my face most importantly so it's kind of
3:09like a primer and moisturize our all-in-one and I really really love it
3:15all the girls like my band-aid
3:19I was actually setting up the lights a little while ago and I got it clamped my
3:25arm and I was like bleeding and it was traumatic
3:29I'm gonna add some radiance to my face because the foundation I'm using I kind
3:34of really have to be doing for it to look good but i still really love it so
3:38i'm going to use it and i'm using the body shop
3:40radiant hi later i got this at the body shop store in california and i really
3:45like it's just like a champagne me pink color
3:49it's really pretty on top of the cheekbones but actually really like it
3:52underneath my makeup as well
3:54ok so the foundation I'm using is the brand new foundation to cover effects
3:59like they just came out with this and this was sent to me actually have an
4:03efficient if I can call Corey a friend
4:06hi Cory if you're watching but i have a friend sort of who works over at cover
4:10of X and sometimes sends me like new products and i love this foundation i
4:15tried out for the first time yesterday and i really like it and usually I do
4:20not like foundations like this because it's like a serum eat kind of foundation
4:24kinda like the Bearskin one from bareMinerals hated it the physicians
4:28formula once in a dropper hated it
4:30I don't like Sierra me things they don't stick wall on my dry skin but this one
4:35if I hydrate actually love the finish
4:38I have mine
4:39g30 it's their cover effects custom cover drops
4:42I love eat just comes out like a dropper like this
4:46I just dropped them on the back of my hand Oh
4:50too much has too much super runny you can see you have to shake it really good
4:55before you apply it says shake law and i like to use my beauty blender with it
5:01that's a little scary lip and all comes together
5:15I really like to finish that this gives it doesn't feel like a matte finish
5:20but it looks kind of like flawless I don't know how to explain it
5:23it is a little light for me as you can see it a little pill but nothing a
5:28little bronzer Catholics
5:29ok moving on I'm going to take my pixie correction concentrate and brightening
5:34the peach writing peach
5:36it's just like an under-eye corrector I'm gonna place it underneath my eyes
5:42here
5:42I've actually been using an eye cream that has really been working it's a new
5:47eye cream and i love it and i feel like my eyes are as dark as they usually are
5:53and I've got a feeling inside cream so I'm not going to add like a concealer
5:58I'm just gonna focus on highlighting i'm using my dream lumi touch highlighting
6:03concealer
6:04I'm just going to draw it and that's like upside down triangle thing just to
6:07highlight my face
6:10if you hear crickets my windows open
6:13I'm going to use my same beauty blender to blend of him
6:25I didn't do it just a little bit what the hell I'm gonna set my under eyes
6:31with my way but uh 1 14 bucks face focus and I'm going to use my HD under eyes
6:40setting powder
6:41I'm trying to see how this one compares to the laura mercier secret brightening
6:45powder so it's called yet because i really love that one thing i don't like
6:50is this
6:51these little glitters like what you really can't see them all that much
6:56ok so I'm going to do my eyes i'm going to apply them using my mac paint pot as
7:03per usual days in my eyes like ninety percent of the time no matter what
7:06because i find that it really really prolongs the world my eye makeup and
7:11hide all the veins on my lids like all the darkness and all the creepy stuff
7:15because it is like a skin tone color or at least the color close to my skin tone
7:20and I just I really really love it cannot say enough about this i'm going
7:26to take the two faced natural met out
7:29Alan talent I'm going to take right here this color called heaven and on the
7:34brush like this
7:35this is just a Zoe but
7:37325 I'm just going to pack this on my entire lid kind of set that cream base
7:43we put down because if I go in with another eye shadow right now and make
7:46Reese it's just going to get stuck to the base
7:48so this is just going to help put a nice like shadow layer
7:52next I'm going to take this fluffy blending brush by NARS I have no idea
7:56what it's called
7:5842 I'm going to take the color called new tea and i'm just going to apply this
8:03in my crease
8:04this is basically just going to act as my transition shade from the colors i
8:07will be using so they could blend easier
8:11do I look blue feel like this is lights make me look good
8:20I'm going to take this color called honey butter it's a really pretty warm
8:24peanut butter shade and i'm going to apply this to my entire lid this is just
8:27going to be like an all over the lid color for me
8:34also got a diff my fluffy blush brush into that color again and added to my

10:10little bit i'm gonna have some eyeliner to mai tais line and my waterline and
10:16i'm going to use the NYX jumbo pencil liner in brown
10:25obviously i love it these are amazing and my new favorite went to the

11:12I just love any mascara that go on top of it makes it that much better
11:16then I'm going with jordanna's best / extreme round cool
11:23this lightning is making me look so pale
11:27I'm gonna cry I just want to have to put on mascara on like on the rest of my
11:30eyes

11:36remember it's the first time using my life bear with me i'm going to go ahead
11:41and bronze up my face i'm going to use the body shops bronzing powder in light
11:46matte 01
11:48looks like this is like a honey honey comb and i'm using my lem tools nine
11:52seven four
11:53I love this bronzer I feel like it's quickly becoming one of my top fav
11:57bronzers ever because it's that happy medium
12:00it's really light when you look at it in the pan and it's pretty late when you
12:04apply it to your face but you can really build it up
12:07I mean it takes some time to build it up but it builds up really pretty and it's
12:10not packed you at all and it's that perfect undertone it's not to read it's
12:16not too orange it's not too pink or cool toned or money looking at like i'm going
12:21to apply my blush with the same brush
12:24these are the new NYX HD blushes and I really really like them especially this
12:29one this is in the shade soft-spoken and it's such a pretty color for spring
12:35if you're into PT blushes pick this one up its really nice
12:38yeah
12:47but because everything is so mad on my face I want to add like a lot more of
12:51glow
12:52i'm going to use this product this is pretty new to me about a couple months
12:54ago
12:55this is the 24 micro smooth bank sculpting trio in lou manizer and I've
13:01never really give any of the stuff for brand products a glass at all but Olivia
13:07my friend that works at sephora was like I really like these i use them all the
13:10time and they're really good so i picked up this one along with two other ones i
13:14was so impressed by it
13:16it's not that expensive so for words like a much cheaper brand like the
13:21Sephora collection and this gives such a pretty glow to the cheek Spencer subtle
13:25glow like a very wearable everyday natural glow and just like to swirl my
13:30entire brush into this like so were lit up and just dust it takes
13:50my highlight my brow bone with this as well
14:04now i'm just going to finish off with my lips and this is the lip gloss i have
14:08been using non stop i wore it like previous videos when I was wearing a
14:11glossy lip
14:12this is the read my lips lip gloss from the bomb in the color Bam and I usually
14:17just apply this but so you know I'm gonna play Red Sox you can see it's such
14:24a pretty pigmented color i've been wearing it not
14:37ok so that completes the look i really hope you like it it's a very wearable
14:40everyday kind of look in my opinion
14:44sorry about the lighting completely sucks in this video I'm still tweaking
14:48it this was like a trial run
14:50once i get my ring light and I think it will look a lot better but i have to
14:54position them differently
14:56it's tough to work on it so excuse that might be like a you know a couple times
15:02before i get it right but this is the look I've been using or I'm wearing a
15:05lot with this palette i hope you guys get it when it's available it's a halt
15:08all right now but I think it's well worth the money
15:12I hope you guys get it you guys so much for watching and please subscribe if you
15:17haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:11hey guys i decided to do a makeup tutorial today on the eye makeup i'm
0:18wearing right now it is a green smokey eye but they're all of tones like they
0:22have some golden them because I never wear green eyeshadow i just don't think
0:26green eye shadow looks good on me I feel like it clashes with my eye color i
0:29don't know but i didn't want to do a green and gold e kind of I look for
0:34those of you who do like to wear green eyeshadow so this is the look i came up
0:38with i am using two different palettes in this tutorial but you can use colors
0:44that you have at home colours are similar to the ones i'm using and the
0:47colors I'm using our from the natural and night palette from to face and the
0:52Naked palette from urban decay i know a lot of people have this but i'm just
0:57using the greens that are in this palette actually like how it turned out
1:00not necessarily on me but I think this would look so beautiful if you have
1:04brown eyes so definitely try it out i do show you the rest of my face like my
1:09foundation my consider and all that stuff because i haven't been showing
1:11that in the last couple videos my just keep it very fresh and natural on the
1:16rest of my face kind of look I was going for
1:19so yeah if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching
1:23ok so like always i'm going to start by priming my eyes and I'm using Mac's
1:26painterly clean hot to do this
1:33now i'm taking my naked palette and I'm using the color naked and i'm going to
1:37use this as my transition color in the crease you can just take any light brown
1:41color
1:51now i'm taking my too faced natural and night palette and I'm going to be using
1:56this color right here called moonstone it is a really pretty
2:01Goldie kind of green it's so nice and i'm going to be putting that on half of
2:10my eyelid on the inner half
2:23I'm taking that all the way up to the crease
2:29but i'm not putting any on the outer be right here now I'm gonna be taking this
2:33color right next to it called night fever which is a deeper green with gold
2:37glitter and this is what's going to be going right on the outer part of my eye
2:44again I'm still a little sick so I still sound a little recipe
2:51forgive me I don't know when I'm going to get rid of this cold
3:02now i'm going back into the Naked palette and I'm getting the color right
3:05here called book and I'm taking that on a fluffy little crease brush and I'm
3:09just going to blend out the colors in my crease
3:20ok so after I've done that I'm going back into my natural night palette and
3:25I'm going to go back into these colors right here and do the exact same thing I
3:29did first only I'm going to be adding 6+2 my brush and this is just going to
3:34intensify the color a lot more
4:10ok so next I'm gonna be taking my 217 i'm going in with this color in the
4:13natural night palette and it is called Coco star like a really pretty brown
4:19even explain it but it's really nice and I'm just going to be taking this into
4:25the outer be right here and then bring it into the crease
4:37I'm bringing that a little bit above my crease as well
4:51then just taking a fluffy brush like this didn't get into that naked color
4:54and just kind of blending that out a little bit more by the way added virgin
5:02as my problem honey I don't know why did that off camera now I'm just going to
5:06add some eyeliner I'm using the Maybelline master drama eyeliner in
5:10midnight master which is just a black and I'm going to tight line with this
5:17and add it to my waterline for my lower lashline and i'm going to be taking the
5:22brown in the natural at night palette here and i'm going to be putting that on
5:31the outer part of my lower lashline the sky just turned black because it knew i
5:39was filming and I know I say sorry in every video so I'm not going to do it
5:45this time but just know the side turn black of course of course i know i keep
5:52going back and forth between these two pallets but what can you do i'm going to
5:57take half baked from the Naked palette and I'm going to add that right here
6:03where this gold is but i'm going to add X plus 2 the brush just to intensify it
6:09may get a lot more vibrant and gold
6:16yeah
6:29I'm going to take spotlight right here and this is gonna be my highlight right
6:35in here
6:37ok so now i'm just going to add some mascara and you can go ahead and add
6:41some winged liner to this look if you want but i like how it looks just like
6:45this my mascara that I'm using is my jordana best / extreme i'm using this on
6:49my top lashes and then for my bottom lashes i'm using be it's so big
6:54volumizing mascara i got this in an empty bag and it actually works pretty
6:58well my bottom lashes and makes them super long so that's what I'm going to
7:02do right now
7:02ok so these are finished eyes if you want to see what is going to go on the
7:08rest of my face then just keep watching
7:10ok so i already filled in my eyebrows i'm really not a fan of how I am green
7:16eye shadow looks at me I know I feel like it just doesn't look good with my
7:21eye color anyway the prime using today is my lauriol magic Lumi Jason never use
7:28this as a primary and now I use it all the time it just makes my skin feel so
7:34nice
7:35the foundation i'm going to be using today is the Maybelline fit me concealer
7:42i have been using this foundation and i gotta say i love it as foundation i
7:51really wish that the fit me foundation had the same creaminess and consistency
7:58as the consider does because honestly this is foundation to me it's not think
8:04it's not cakey and it doesn't make my dry skin look dry
8:12and it has the coverage because it's a concealer is awesome
8:16of course i use a crap ton of product so I waste this pretty easily but
8:28I like it going to be using my Beauty Blender
8:38yeah
8:58for my under eyes I'm using my Maybelline instant age rewind dark
9:01circle eraser crank this up
9:11yeah
9:25yeah
9:29underneath my eyes I'm using my mineralize skinfinish natural and I
9:35always do because it's the bomb diggity
9:38your browser I'm using the Sonia Kashuk warm bronzer
9:47I mean cream bronzer in warm tan just click this and I use that with a real
9:55techniques buffing brush I like this because it gives a very subtle bronze
10:04i'm going to should have left my hair up
10:16huh
10:40yeah
10:48see it's not too pigmented where it looks a little scary just kinda looks
10:51like a natural bronze glow to your face
10:54I really love that for blush I'm using Mac's Melba it is a matte peachy kind of
11:02blush
11:15i'm giving a pretty simple on my lips I'm just using the NYX butter gloss in
11:20creme brulee
11:31ok guys that's it i wanted to do a pretty sultry I look and then keep it
11:35pretty natural and fresh on the rest of my face so I hope you like this tutorial
11:40let me know down below if you did please subscribe if you haven't already and I
11:44will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look I was so surprised
0:16at how many people wanted a tutorial on this look I was wearing this in my
0:20empties video and there were a ton of comments telling me that I needed to sit
0:25down and film this video so i did I didn't think I was going to because the
0:29look is literally so easy it's like easiest look ever but i love this look I
0:34think it's so romantic and pretty kind of like a serial like a soft pink yeah
0:40this is actually a talk through makeup tutorial and if you want to see how to
0:44get this look on my face then just keep watching
0:46so I'm gonna start off with my face since the eyes are so simple i don't
0:49really get a lot of fallout with this look I'm going in with the Knicks born
0:53to glow illuminating primer and i'm just using this on my skin to help it look
0:58nice and glowy this stuff is so similar to the max stroke cream and it's way way
1:04more affordable the foundation going to be using today is the Too Faced Born
1:09This Way Foundation it's the same foundation i was wearing in my empties
1:12video I have a love-hate relationship with this foundation sometimes i like it
1:16sometimes i hate it i like it for the most part by the way i'm using the shade
1:20porcelain i like it for the most part but it can look pretty cakey around my
1:24nose sometimes it just looks heavy on my skin I don't know why but I like it's
1:30just I don't know i'm using a sponge from the brand mascara it's really
1:38really similar to the Beauty Blender and it's more affordable because you're
1:41going to be using today is the tart shape concealer I can't seem to use any
1:45other concealer i mean i do everything I have other concealers i love but these
1:49are just my favorite right now and it's making me want to go on another snapchat
1:52declutter I kind of stopped that series because there was nothing else I really
1:56wanted to declutter but after discovering this amazing concealer I
2:01want to kind of get rid of some of them because
2:04is I don't really use them so i'm just adding a little bit on the inner corners
2:09right here to then blend it out I mixed the shades light/medium and fair and i'm
2:13just going to blend that out you really do not need a lot of this concealer I
2:19know when it comes to youtube videos like you'll see youtubers just like
2:22paint on the concealer like i do i always like paint on my concealer but
2:26for this one specifically I feel like you don't need to do that because a
2:30little goes such a long way so I'm thinking of doing that you really really
2:34really want to give away or get rid of a couple of my concealers because this one
2:40is just so amazing
2:42just a couple just a couple just get rid of a couple i'm going to take a little
2:45bit of the shade fair and apply it to areas i kinda want to highlight a little
2:50bit
2:58I'm going to go in with another cream product and then i'll set my under eye
3:01concealer and all that so I'm going to take my cover effects custom enhancer
3:05drops in the shade sunkist this is the bronze shade the light one i have been
3:10using this as bronzer i love it so much I just take some in the back of my hand
3:14after I shake it a bit and with that same sponge I used for foundation and
3:19concealer i'm just going to apply some to my face
3:31I think this might be the best liquid bronzer i have ever come across in my
3:36life it just blends so well into the skin i'm going to apply some more for
3:41the other side of my face
4:00Celine learned how to open my door now looks like I'm gonna have to change the
4:03doorknobs no privacy with that one
4:06I called my door and asked her to stay outside cuz i'm filming and changes
4:08opens it she's like yeah no I'm coming in gonna add some to my doll line here
4:15ok so now i'm going to go ahead and set my under eye concealer and set areas of
4:22my face when I feel like it needs to be set i'm going to take my rms beauty one
4:26powder just kind of like a translucent HD powder and with this 24 procon tour
4:31number 79 brush i'm just going to set everything
4:44so after powdering my face looks a little bit more mad than I wanted to
4:48so what I did was I went in with this shimmery bronzer it's so dark like this
4:52is way too dark for my skin tone so I have to make sure i use a super super
4:57night hand this is an alpha mineral bronzer in the shade beach bronze i'm
5:01going to take this pressure here i bought it at all so this is the it
5:04cosmetics for alta line exclusively at ulta and this is their airbrush powder
5:09brush I'm gonna take a little bit and I'm going to really tap this off
5:22ok so i'm going to go ahead and do the eye makeup because I really feel like I
5:29need to do my eyes already
5:31okay so I lied apparently there is fallout with this look because of the
5:34glitter I completely forgot about that for some reason so i would suggest doing
5:38your eyes first before your face makeup i'm going to take my surprise rhymes
5:42Anasazi and water one is long and i'm going to take this shaver here called
5:46ball fresco and i'm going to buff this into my crease using a more fiemme 441
5:50brush i'm adding just a little bit of this color to my crease because i will
5:56go back into intensify it a little bit i'm going to take tempera which is this
6:04lightest shade at the front and i'm going to use that to highlight
6:07underneath my rubble and then i'm going to go in with this shining star right
6:13here this is the butter london a butter london something it doesn't say i hate
6:18when companies that was the name of this thing it's like a cream eyeshadow but
6:23it's not like a cream in my opinion it has a similar consistency to hair gel
6:27like really thick sculpting hair gel that is the consistency of this but
6:32they're just like little potted eyeshadows in jelly form this specific
6:37color is in the shade frosted and it's my favorite one they sent me like four
6:40shades
6:41this is so stunning my favorite way to apply this is with my finger so I'm just
6:46gonna dip my finger in there
6:47and I like to build up the coverage so i'll go in a couple times but I'll just
6:51start to apply this to my
6:59yeah
7:02I'm not trying to flick you off i promise i know it's my middle finger but
7:06it's not my intention and apply some more through a good thing about this
7:10eyeshadow is that it builds really well it doesn't get sticky and it lasts a
7:14long time I i I'm going to go back into the Anasazi palette and I'm gonna take
7:18ballbust Oh again i can't say that word normal and with that same crease brush I
7:22used earlier i'm going to add a little bit more of this eyeshadow
7:33ok
7:35I'll just go in with a little bit more of that frosted shade for my inner
7:44corners I'm going to mix these two shades together
7:46premier and primavera first i'm going with Vermeer and then i'm going to top
7:52it off with primera for my lower lashline I'm doing something extremely
7:58simple i'm going to go in with blonde fresco on a little pencil brush this is
8:02a tiny little ecotools shadow smudger brush I'm going to run that on my lower
8:06lashline and then over top of that i'm going to take burnt orange going to curl
8:20my lashes you can go ahead and wear falsies with my empties video I wasn't
8:26wearing any falsies so I'm just going to coat my top and bottom lashes with my
8:30benefit roller lash so that completes the is really simple and we're pretty
8:38much almost done when I filmed my empties video I wasn't wearing any blush
8:42i just went in with my highlight and I used my makeup geek highlighting palette
8:46and I first went in with the pink shade this is called Starling i'm going to try
8:50out this brush this is the morphe are 36 and dip it into that starlight shade
8:58you definitely want to tap off the excess when you're using these
9:02highlights because they're extremely pigmented and then i'm going to go over
9:09top with the shade night light which is the lightest gold shade
9:20I'm going to mix the shade nightlight and starlight and highlight the nose a
9:24little bit and I'm going to take just starlight and highlight my Cupid's will
9:31for lips i was wearing a very very very nude lip almost concealer like but i
9:39think it ties in with like the light pink ethereal look I'm going in with the
9:44buxom true nude lip foundation in the shade but this is the lightest shade
9:48it's so light
9:50the trick with this specific color is you cannot apply too much I find that
9:53when i do that i get that disgusting white thing on the inside of my mouth
9:57you know what i'm talking about so i actually have to tap this on my mouth
10:01and then I just blend in and then i went over it with the colour-pop ultra glossy
10:17lip in the shade fairy floss
10:19this is my favorite shade of all of the new color pop glasses it's just like a
10:23very very light nude but it's not too pigmented it's a sheer formula i love it
10:28i find that glosses this color that are too pigmented give you that weird thing
10:37you think I was talking about
10:41ok guys so that completes the look i really hope you guys enjoyed it i love
10:46looks like this was like a super nude lip and everything kind of like
10:49monochromatic i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for
10:52watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next
10:55video bye
0:00hey guys hey guys so today's video is going to be a tiny get ready i haven't
0:07done one of these videos in a really long time I feel so I decided that is
0:11what i want to do today and it's also going to be kind of like a one brand
0:15video not a one brand tutorial because I don't have a specific look in mind i'm
0:19just going to chat with you guys and some makeup on but it is going to be
0:23using these two for our collection products i asked you guys on Twitter
0:27recently not that recently but I asked you guys on Twitter if you wanted to see
0:31a one brand video using the Sephora collection which if you don't know it's
0:37pretty much so for us brands like so for ourselves a bunch of different brands
0:40but they also have their own personal brand called sephora collection and it's
0:45a lot more affordable than their other brands sold there
0:48it's not necessarily drugstore prices but not very high end either for some of
0:52these are actually going to be first impressions
0:55some of these already tried by the way I know I know I know I know
0:58no i did not post a video monday or wednesday today is Friday
1:03I never go this long without posting a video my last video was a week ago
1:07that is so unlike me but I couldn't post the video on monday because this weekend
1:11was completely crazy i had no time and then monday came and the people who are
1:16installing our closets and the people who are it's only our curtains and
1:20windows came at the same time so I had people making so much noise here monday
1:25i couldn't film they had to come back to finish tuesday i couldn't film and then
1:29yesterday we had to come back to finish
1:31I could have felt so today I decided okay finally I can sit down the phone
1:35and yesterday i woke up with a cold and I was like oh no I'm not going to let a
1:42stuffy nose and a fever
1:44stop me from filming know so please excuse the fact that i have a cold
1:49story of my life find to drink more vitamin C
1:52ok so i'm going to go ahead and get started I've got my little coffee
1:55so now that it's officially spring i bought a new little headband to use in
2:01my tutorials
2:02oh isn't it beautiful
2:06I love him my little hearts might make a comeback next fall in would i bought
2:11these at forever 21
2:12ok so I'm going to start off with a primer I'm gonna actually start off with
2:16my face makeup
2:17i'm going to be using these two for our Beauty amplifier after Google primer and
2:21lou manizer from the Sephora collection
2:24all of these products are from the support brand so i'm not going to say
2:28that every time because i know that's our knowing this product is pretty new
2:31I've never tried it before so this is like a first impression
2:35it comes out a really beautiful like gold liquid
2:39this is kind of reminding me of the door glow maximizer that's like super super
2:48expensive
2:50this has like a similar feel to it
2:53I don't know it could be something I like
2:56ok so now that is on my face i'm actually going to go ahead and do my
2:59eyebrows I always do my eyebrows off camera but i had bought a stew for a
3:04brow product
3:05this is there retractable brow pencil and it's waterproof and I got rich
3:09chestnut not sure if this matches me the only thing I don't like right off the
3:13bat when I look at it is the little comb
3:15it's not a spoolie it's like a comb and I'm not into these like they hurt like
3:23how scratching my forehand
3:25so I'm just going to go ahead and do my eyebrows
3:30it's a little reddish for my brows like it's a very warm brown actually really
3:48like it I like it it's really easy to use I don't like the color it's a little
3:51bit red for my hair blue for this video
3:55it's okay
3:58like I don't understand why they don't just put a spoolie like what is this
4:04little fork
4:05now i'm going to go ahead with this so for a brow thickener which I don't need
4:10this shit
4:11I don't need any more thickness but it's like a brow powder it's so strange i've
4:15never tried this before either
4:17this is in the shade medium brown some vodka
4:26maybe this will told him down the redness
4:33well that will blow you know what this is cool for sometimes when you use a
4:40pencil you kind of missed certain spots
4:44this is really cool to just go over those spots you missed or if you have
4:47really really full brows and you only need a little bit of like something
4:52this is pretty cool my browser not twins today just regular old sisters
4:57ok so for foundation i bought 2 to 4 brand foundations
5:01I have the perfection mr. airbrush foundation because a lot of you guys
5:05said it was a dupe for my dior air flash and then i bought the 10-hour where
5:11perfection foundation
5:13I was going to try this one out today but this is way too dark for me this is
5:18like my tanning shaidan is not down so i'm going to use this 1i got the shade
5:24light
5:25it says its oil free and has a second skin technology has medium coverage
5:29paraben free fragrance free formulated without mineral oil non-comedogenic
5:33sounds great great great
5:36so it looks pretty thick it's not very liquidy
5:40we shall see i prefer kind of like more liquidity
5:46the pump on this foundation is really amazing like you could really control
5:51how much you take out
5:56ok so that is a pump and a half of foundation i'm not exactly sure the
6:00finish of it because i use a very luminizing primer underneath so right
6:05now it's looking really like Dewey and radiant it has some tackiness to it for
6:10sure
6:10I'm going to go in with some concealer this is their bright future gel serum
6:15concealer and i've heard mixed reviews about this concealer this is another
6:18product i've never used before a lot of these products
6:20i just bought I heard that some people like it but the application sucks
6:24because it's the weirdest thing but product doesn't get on the entire wand
6:29only at the very tip so you do have to like it's meant to be dotted but you
6:35can't really like rub because no product comes off so you have to like constantly
6:40dip your wand back into the concealer which is really weird and kind of time
6:47consuming so that's kind of lonely around enough my slumber
6:59because i have a cold i do have like some discoloration on my eyelids so I'm
7:07dragging that on my lids
7:09I don't know I know how I feel about that I don't know how i feel about this
7:12concealer
7:13it's a little bit cakey on my skin but it didn't blend out nicely
7:17mmm ok so i'm going to go ahead and set my under eye concealer I don't have a
7:22translucent powder from sephora this is their micro smooth baked face compact
7:28and medium which looks hella dark
7:31I'm just going to set my face using the NARS translucent crystal powder
7:37i'm going to apply just a really light layer of this powder to my face using it
7:45was a mild simple brush because I do feel like this foundation needs to be
7:50set
7:50it's a little bit tacky so recently i purchased the bronzing powder in low
7:57squabbles
7:58this is what it looks like i really really love this but I saw that they
8:01came out with a sculptor like a contour product in the shade lowest cobbles
8:07this is still being sold on this afore website purchase this one just in case
8:11anybody was wondering if there's a difference like if it's exactly the same
8:16why are they selling both of them and they're pretty much the same color but
8:20this one is much more pigmented let me show you okay so i'm going to swatch
8:30this one is so much more pigmented this one is a lot softer so I don't know what
8:36the dealio with that is but today I'm going to contour using this one because
8:40it is a little bit less pigmented so I don't want to go in with such a heavy
8:44hand
8:45I kind of might prefer this one over the other would because it lets you
8:53it lets you build up the color but if you aren't as fair as me then definitely
8:58go for the like og because it's you'll get a better color payoff
9:02so is anybody caught up with how to get away with murder i'm not going to ruin
9:08it i'm not going to say any spoilers but I don't even know how to feel about that
9:14finale
9:15I'm not going to spoil it but i do like Frank and I know that I shouldn't
9:19because Frank is not a good person at all but i do like Frank
9:24I don't know why what is wrong with me and also sign no I am 100-percent
9:29completely over scandal
9:31I was obsessed with scandal guys like it was my issue you know I was so team
9:37jacob was all about that show but now it's just it's gotten to the point where
9:41it's like okay put a lid on this show and I'm sorry for those of you really
9:45really still love it
9:46I just can't deal with Olivia Pope anymore she is a stone-cold biatch
9:50I don't know and I just don't like where the show is going I'm like so incredibly
9:53bored it's a snoozefest
9:55I haven't seen like the last three episodes how to get away with murder
9:58scandal
10:01No ok so I really really really like this product
10:05it gave me a very soft natural contour as opposed to this would be a little bit
10:09stronger but I like them both with a tan
10:13I might want to use something more pigmented I don't know this is so weird
10:16but I'm going to go in with blush next and i'm going to be using one
10:21these blushes and I have the shade can't stop smiling which is a really pretty
10:27peach and then
10:28so shy which is like a nice bubble gum pink I'm actually gonna go with the
10:31peach one cuz I'm might be doing like a regular bronzy I the usual you know it's
10:38not a tutorial
10:40now i'm going to highlight and to be completely honest i'm not a big fan of
10:48any of the highlighting products so for a collection has I tried one of their
10:53illuminators that look like this
10:55it comes in this packaging and I did not like i have these sephora radiant
11:00luminizing drops
11:01this is in morning light i'm going to try to death some of this on my
11:05cheekbones
11:05even though i already applied powder but what about okay so i just added a little
11:16bit of something I didn't want to disrupt my foundation underneath and my
11:19blush which I kind of did
11:21so I'm going to take the illuminator in this little trio
11:25it's a very very subtle highlight like you don't get much from this at all
11:31there's not much color payoff at all at all actually want a little bit more
11:39glowing assign oh that's crazy but I'm going to take this
11:42sephora baked blush duo and mango being i love these like luminous
11:48so for blushes they're amazing add some right here
11:52ok so I'm going to do my eyes keep in mind when you use products like this you
11:59can use these wet
12:00so if you want even more intense highlight you can what this
12:04now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm going to do something very very simple
12:07i'm going to use their baked eyeshadow trio in indian summer i'm actually going
12:11to use the bronzer shade in this to use as my crease shade and I'm gonna buff
12:19this into the crease
12:20I use the bronzer as eyeshadow all the time
12:24I'm going to take my brush and spray mac fix+ Honor this is a mac 239 and then
12:33I'm going to go into this shade right here it's a really pretty bronzy taupe
12:37color and i'm going to use that all over my lid wedding the eyeshadow is
12:41definitely going to intensify it and these baked products are awesome too wet
12:44because you don't mess up the eye shadow
12:53then I'm going to go into this really dark chocolatey shade this is a sophie
13:00320 brush kind of like a mac 217 and I'm going to pack that on my outer corners
13:05not going to wet my brush
13:10I only want just a little bit of depth for my waterline i'm going to take the
13:20waterproof retractable eyeliner in the shade and deep plum mat deep plum and
13:26I've never tried this before and it's not my favorite the colour-pop liners
13:34are like five dollars and they are so much more pigmented in this my gosh that
13:39is totally a bus for me like struggle to put that on
13:43I'm going to blend that out using the chocolate color
13:47I'm going with mascara next and I didn't buy a mascara because i'm a fool
13:56so I'm going to go in with mike eagle extra sculpt
14:01ok so we are pretty much done here I'm just going to go in with my lip combo
14:07I'm going with the sephora ruse Joe lip liner in the shade
14:11nothing but nude as I haven't used this color before I just bought it but i have
14:16used this formula and it's amazing i really love these lip liners
14:20this is such a pretty lip liner I love it and the formula i love it a lot of it
14:29I'm gonna go over it with this guy right here I don't even know what this is
14:32called just saw it on the support website and i was like wow that looks
14:35really pretty color
14:36I don't even know what the name of it is I don't know if it's like their lip balm
14:39and lip stick thing but it comes in this packaging and this is in the shade
14:42number one
14:43yeah I have no idea like who
14:48I like that it's still pretty and it feels so comfortable on the lips had a
14:57really good color payoff
14:59I can't smell it because my nose is stuffy but i really like that
15:03ok guys so that completes this look I know that this video wasn't very chatty
15:07but honestly I'm just under the weather and I don't feel the best but I had to
15:12get a video up so i'm sorry if i wasn't very entertaining in this video I'm
15:15sorry
15:16some of these definitely were hits and some of these definitely misses the
15:20primer amazing i gave my skin really glowy look I really really like that so
15:25far this foundation looks good it does look like second skin it's not too bad
15:28actually think I don't like this because all the places where i apply the
15:33concealer made my skin look a little bit cakey great broad product if it was less
15:37warm and it came with a spoolie but i really like it
15:40and this product is pretty cool too this is a great little contour amazing
15:44not a fan of the highlight in this really really loved the blush
15:48I love their blushes they're baked ones and their color for one's awesome
15:52blushes and while this is really pretty
15:55it only works wet because this brown chain i was having a hard time like
15:59applying it to my lid and i'm also not a fan at all this eyeliner but i really
16:05really really really love their lip liner formula and this like lip balm
16:09nude
16:10number one thing is beautiful love it so that completes this video I hope you
16:15guys enjoy thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't
16:18already and I will see you in my next video
0:26hey guys so today's video is going to be a tutorial using the electric palette
0:32from urban decay
0:33please excuse that . on my eyelid
0:37I did it with my eyeliner by mistake at the end of this video and it upset me
0:41I know but let's pretend this lone pair shall we so this look is really fun and
0:46dramatic and I know it's not for everybody but i just think it's really
0:49cool and I do basic everyday tutorials on my channel all the time so I decided
0:53to switch it up
0:54let's go so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to take max painterly Paint
0:58Pot and i'm going to apply this to my entire lid
1:00this is going to act as a base cover up any redness and find my eyes as well
1:04going into the Urban Decay palette i'm going to take the color called chaos
1:09it is a really bright royal blue and I'm gonna pack this on my entire lid and
1:13then forgot that I had an added tape to the corner of my eye so i quickly add
1:17that this is just gonna make a cat eye effect and make everything look sharp
1:21and clean so I'm just gonna pack this on my entire lid and bring it up to
1:25decrease
1:33next I'm going to take this milani eyeshadow called below cafe i believe
1:36and I'm just gonna bust this into my crease as a transition shade it's just
1:40going to help that blue blend out a little bit more
1:55next I'm going to take this eyeshadow and the pally called urban it is a
1:59beautiful purple and i'm going to start building this color in my crease with a
2:03mac 217
2:05this part is super tedious and it takes a lot of work but just go back and forth
2:09in the eye shadow and build up the color
2:11little by little because it is such an intense color you are going to want to
2:15build this up and work very very slowly and just pack it on a little by little I
2:20know it can be time consuming but it's better to do it this way they look like
2:24you have way too much in the crease so I'm just going back and forth dipping my
2:29brush in the eye shadow and slightly blending it into my crease then i'm
2:33going to go back into chaos and pack this onto my lid because a lot of it and
2:39get blended away from all the blending we did these two colors look really cool
2:43layered on top of each other because it looks like three different eye shadows
2:46on my lid when really there's just two of them
2:49it's really cool so now back with my - 17 I'm going back into the urban shade
2:54and building it again like I said little by little i'm also dragging it that
2:59brush into my crease really really lightly so that it can blend seamlessly
3:03so I'm packing most of the color right in the socket of my crease and then with
3:07the really light hand I'm trying to feather it out
3:10higher in my crease if that makes any sense
3:17and then again some more packing on of that chaos color
3:25I know time-consuming just going to go back and forth between these two
3:28eyeshadows now I'm just going to clean up some of the fallout with any makeup
3:32remover wipe and then I'm going to take the Urban Decay Naked basics palette i'm
3:37going to go into that shade foxy and I'm going to blend this underneath my brow
3:40bone
3:41this is just gonna help that purple color blend out a little bit better then
3:45I don't know why I didn't record myself doing that but I dip this brush into the
3:50shimmery shade in The Naked basics palette and apply that to my energy or
3:54dust and underneath my brow bone to highlight now I'm just gonna add some
3:58winged eyeliner I'm going to take my la girl very black gel eyeliner and just
4:03add a wing and then of course I got so close
4:07I got out of focus as per usual I'm going to move on to the rest of my face
4:12and I'm going to take my Too Faced hangover primer and this is just going
4:14to prime my face and moisturize my face really well
4:22next I'm gonna mix two foundations and they're both the Rimmel stay matte
4:26foundation and i'm just going to buff this into my skin using a real
4:30techniques expert face brush I'm going to quickly skim through the face like I
4:38usually do because you know it's something you've seen very many times
4:42before and I think people are more interested in the eye
4:45look at this video then what's on the rest of my face
4:48I'm gonna take my Maybelline fit me consider I believe this is in the shade
4:5210 light or 15 bear i'm not exactly sure I think it's 10 and I'm just gonna cover
4:58my dark circles with this and highlight my face a little bit
5:16i'm going to set everything using Mac's emphasize powder and i'm using this on
5:23an elf flawless concealer brush
5:25I believe that's the name
5:29now i'm going to take this milani jumbo pencil in the shade royal purple and i'm
5:36going to use this as my eyeliner
5:38this is just going to make the look look extra probably on the bottom / believe
5:42yeah i know i'm going to take carbon again on a pencil brush and just much
5:46this underneath my lash line
5:53yeah
5:59then I'm going to dip that pencil brush into milania's Bella cafe and i'm going
6:03to further smoke it out so it looks nice and smoky on the bottom
6:06I'm just going to drag it towards the winged eyeliner i don't know if you can
6:10tell I'm just dragging it up towards the wing and I should have zoomed in this
6:14part but I completely forgot
6:15of course then I'm just going to quickly curl my lashes at the mascara and then
6:21i'm going to apply some falsies i'm going to use the R del wispies and then
6:26i'm going to finish off my face
6:27I'm going to take been nice powder Rouge in the shade contour number one and
6:32unequal tools brush I'm going to contour my face
6:57I'm going to take this tart blush in the shade exposed
7:00I don't want something super pigmented or noticeable on my cheeks and my eyes
7:04are already so loud
7:05so I'm going for a natural blush lipstick
7:10I'm going to use my Too Faced lipstick in the shade nude beach and yeah it's
7:16really pretty new color love this lipstick taking my physicians formula
7:21stripper stripper no shimmer strip while shimmer strips and natural nude i'm
7:27going to use this to highlight
7:28ok guys so that completes this look I really hope you enjoyed it thank you
7:33guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
7:36will see you in my next video bye
0:15hey guys today's videos in makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right
0:23here this is using the Anastasia i keep saying Anastasia and I'm trying to teach
0:30myself to say anastacio artists palette this just recently came out i purchased
0:36my nap ulta.com I don't know if they're still in stock or not but i'm pretty
0:40sure i purchased it like the Dare than the day after it came out I wanted to
0:44buy it because i have so many neutral palette and this one just looked
0:50different to me because they do have other neutral colors thrown in the mix
0:54this is actually a really really easy like ridiculous like ridiculously easy
0:59makeup tutorial which is ok right because it's like one Shadow kind of and
1:06I feel like there's so many tutorials out there that it's like real that are
1:10really hard to recreate and I feel like this is pretty easy to recreate I know
1:13it's a little bit out there because it has like that super bowl yellow under I
1:18and in person it's a lot more intense like I didn't think this yellow color
1:22would be as intense as it is which I'm glad it is because it's really pigmented
1:26they're really like it so far
1:28so yeah I like this palette give it a big thumbs up and if you want to see how
1:32to give these Luke I've been my whole face but if you want to get this look
1:37then just keep watching
1:38I'm going to prime my eyelids with Mac's painterly Paint Pot it is my all-time
1:43favorite you guys know I'm gonna take the artist Shalit what the artist
1:49palette and the shadow called buttery it's a creamy matte vanilla shade and
1:56i'm going to set that paint pot with that shadow
1:58I'm gonna take dusty rose it's a beautiful Dessi rose color a little bit
2:03mabi it's seriously stunning one of my favorites in this palette and it blends
2:08like a dream and I'm going to apply that in windshield wiper motions into my
2:12crease using a big fluffy blending brush
2:16this matte purple color is called aubergine and its really really
2:20pigmented but you do have to kind of like work in little sections so i'm
2:23using this on a flat shader brush and I'm just packing that onto my eyelid and
2:29that's going on my entire lid but I'm not gonna take it past the crease with a
2:37smaller fluffy brush really similar to the mac 217 this one's just from Sophie
2:42I'm going to go back into that dusty rose shade and then I'm going to blend
2:46out the harsh lines that the aubergine shade kind of made if that makes sense
2:52now I'm going back into that flat shader brush and I'm doing the whole thing all
3:01over again because a lot of the color does get blood away once you start
3:05blending in the crease i'm just doing it all over again and then taking a little
3:09bit more of the dusty rose and just blowing out the look i wanted to be
3:13really smoky in the crease and kind of played nicely i'm going to take a small
3:20little brush and add the buttery shade underneath my brow bone to kind of lift
3:25the brow a little bit so I'm going to start on my face I was like crying
3:29because I was watching The Voice which constantly makes me cry but anyway i'm
3:34taking the Makeup Forever hydrating primer and i'm applying that to my
3:39entire face and then I'm gonna mix both of the Maybelline matte and poreless and
3:46the original fit the original foot me is a lot more dewy and the matte and
3:50poreless is obviously not and poreless they're both from the fit me line but I
3:54find that combining both of them together i get such a natural beautiful
3:58finish and i'm using an elf stippling brush to apply that or concealer i'm
4:03using my Mac Pro Longwear and I'm taking this on like a pointy little brush from
4:08sedona lease
4:09and then this I'm what I'm going to drag it across my I to kind of sharpen the
4:14makeup the eye makeup as you just saw if that makes sense so yeah covering my
4:19dark circles and then cleaning everything up with this concealer as
4:22well and i'm also highlighting a little bit more with my maybelline dream lumi
4:28magically dream lumi touch highlighting concealer in ivory so i am adding some
4:36more underneath my eyes and then highlighting other parts of my face with
4:39this concealer as well and then I'm just going to blend that all and using that
4:44same brush I used to blend out or to apply my mac concealer I feel like it
4:49cannot speak today I don't know what's wrong with me
4:56so I'm going to take my favorite product ever this is the two-faced cocoa contour
5:03kit and I'm gonna take this
5:05morphy blush brush and I'm going to dip it into the shade like cocoa and this is
5:10gonna set my concealer and bring a lot of light underneath fine
5:13it's a beautiful like Matt the kind of the glowy highlighting powder i love it
5:20so I'm gonna finish off my eyes before I go on to the rest of my face I'm gonna
5:24take this color called brush is a very vibrant Matt bright yellow and on a
5:30sigma pencil brush I'm going to apply that underneath my lower lashline i'm
5:34going to drag it down pretty far as you can see on my other eye
5:39I yeah i'm also gonna bring that into my teacher just as well and i'm going to be
5:43very very messy with this i'm going to apply that sucker all over my lower
5:48lashes and i'm going to extend it to wear the purple is as well I'm gonna
5:53take this buttery shade again buttery yeah buttery shade again and on that
5:57same pencil brush I'm just gonna go over my inner tear duct because i don't want
6:00to start yellow on the inner corners just like a light yellow this is the NYC
6:07liquid eyeliner my favorite it's nice black and Matt and I love it and I'm
6:12just going to do a typical wing and of course i can never catch that on camera
6:16so yeah just do the wing like I normally do i added some false lashes and i'm
6:20using the L'Oreal telescopic mascara on my lower lashes not too much because i
6:25don't want to take away from the yellow under I but that pretty much completes
6:29the eye makeup now I'm going to contour using the medium cocoa powder in this
6:35contouring kit this one is like a very cool tone brown so it's perfect for
6:40contouring and i'm using that on my brush there my friend got her Ipsy bag
6:43and gave it to me so yeah i'm using that to contour i love this for contouring
6:49it's the perfect undertone seriously beautiful
6:52and it smells like Coco so you know I like eat so I just contouring my face
7:04like I normally would sides of my nose and my jawline and all that stuff and
7:11now I just want to warm up my cheeks a little bit so I'm taking a fluffier
7:14brush this is from zoeva and I'm dipping it into the medium cocoa shade in the
7:19kit it's a lot warmer as you can see there was something on that brush don't
7:24know what that was but it's warmer so it gives a nice warm to the skin it's nice
7:31i love it like i love it so much the only thing i don't like about the
7:34contouring kit is that shimmery highlight I don't like it at all like
7:38glittery weird so to highlight my cheekbones i'm using this elf sunkist
7:43bronzer in the shade sunkist you can't tell on camera but it gives the most
7:47beautiful golden glow and it's two dollars i love it
7:50now I'm going to line my lips using the two-faced perfect lips lip liner in the
7:55shade perfect nude i love this lip liner it's like my favorite I've talked about
8:00it plenty of times we have just gonna overdraw my lips just a tiny bit not too
8:06crazy but yeah I'm gonna do that and then just fill them in and then i'm

0:13I kind of wanted to do a video where I used neon bright colors in a wearable
0:19way
0:19it's an extremely extremely easy makeup look
0:24and I'm very very excited for this video because this video is sponsored by
0:27benefit which is exciting because i love benefit and in today's video I'm going
0:32to be using their cheekathon palette
0:35this is their blush kit and its really really nice because you get five
0:39full-size products in this palette and even though this is a blush get you
0:44still get a nice bronzer in there as well so it comes with a rocket or blush
0:48which is probably my favorite benefit blush of all time I love it
0:53hoola bronzer dandelion blush coralista blush and Dallas blush / bronzer
1:00I feel like this one could be both you also get the little brush that comes in
1:04all of their box powders
1:06I really love that they put this in the kit because it's perfect to contour with
1:10have been some pool
1:12contour a little bit this palette retails for fifty eight dollars but
1:16everything in here is full size
1:18so the value is actually a hundred and forty five dollars like if you were to
1:22buy all of these products separately it would be like a hundred and forty five
1:25bucks but you can save some moolah and get this kit for 58 which is awesome so
1:30I will link this product in the description box below in case you want

2:33you guys a little bit of that so I hope you guys enjoyed these little clips but
2:37yes let's get into the tutorial now
2:42so to start off this look I'm going in with my glossy a priming moisturizer
2:47it's a very very hydrating a primer i love it
2:51now i'm going in with foundation this is the key go universal-fit hydrating
2:54foundation
2:55I'm putting this on with my peer sponge I love this foundation it's not to do it
3:00but it's not mad either it's like a perfect blend the perfect in between
3:05I'm going to go in with some concealer this is the Catrice waterproof liquid
3:09camouflage concealer i love this concealer its full coverage and I really
3:13really like how it blends out it blends effortlessly
3:17so I'm just blending that in with the same sponge I applied with my foundation
3:21now i'm gonna just add a little bit of something underneath the eyes to
3:25highlight a bit
3:26this is dandelion shy beam it's like a map pinky highlight so it's perfect to
3:30brighten up the under eyes
3:36i'm going to set that concealer down using my RC ma no color powder
3:40i'm also going to set my eyelids because i did use that concealer kind of like a
3:45primer for the eye shadow
3:47so I'm just sitting down everywhere I put some concealer
3:50now i'm going into the benefit cheekathon palette i'm going to take
3:53this little benefit bamboo brush and I'm going to dip it into hula and i'm just
3:57going to bronze up the skin with this brush I'm going to go in and contour in
4:00a second but i'm just using this brush to lightly apply some hula all over Z
4:05face
4:05now i'm going to take the little contour brush in the kit and i'm going to start
4:10to contour with this brush and then I'm going to flip it on its side to kind of
4:13blend everything out
4:20for blush I'm going to mix two shades together i'm gonna take the coralista
4:24blush and rocket or I really like the combo of these two blushes and i'm going
4:29to apply these to my sheiks
4:36now i'm going to highlight my face using the makeup revolution shimmer brick in
4:41the shade radiant it's a very intense highlight as you can see very intense
4:46take your time to blend this out but it is very very beautiful and very
4:50affordable i love it
4:51so to set all those powders down i just took my pixie milky hydrating mist and
4:57spread that all over my face and now i'm going to move on to my eyes
5:01first I'm going to take makeup geeks Peach Smoothie eyeshadow i'm going to
5:04use this as a transition shade i love the warm
5:08peachy color in this eyeshadow amazing i love it
5:11now i'm going to go in with Poppy also by make a peek
5:14i'm using all makeup geek eyeshadows in today's tutorial and i'm going to start
5:18slowly dragging this color into the crease I want it concentrated on the
5:23outer corners of my eyes and in my crease as well so i'm just taking that a
5:28nice fluffy blending brush and blending that it
5:31next I took makeup geeks mocha and i'm applying this only on the outer corners
5:35just to add a little bit of depth I wanted a color that was a little bit
5:38deeper and more natural so I took a dark brown just the violence balance
5:43everything out
5:45then I took I'm peach list this is a duochrome eyeshadow and i'm applying
5:49this to the inner corners and a little bit like on the top and bottom like
5:54inner half there just to brighten and highlight those sections and for
5:58underneath my brow bone I didn't want something too shimmery so I took white
6:02lies which is a nice matte vibrant white
6:05so for the lower lash line I'm just taking peach smoothie on a pencil brush
6:09and pretty much putting this everywhere
6:12buffing that right in my lower lash line and then I'm taking this amazing color
6:16pop eyeliner in the shade puppy
6:18sony on so intensely orange it's amazing i'm putting that on my waterline and
6:24then to blend things out a little bit i'm taking papi and blending it really
6:29really close to the eyeliner
6:30just so that everything you know there's no harsh lines or anything
6:33then I took Peach Smoothie one more time and blended the crap out of poppy and
6:38yeah
6:39then I curl my lashes this was before I burned off my eyelashes on that I yes
6:44this video is pretty recording before I did that and i'm looking at my eyelashes
6:47and i'm getting a little sad but you know what
6:49it's just eyelashes let's move on i'm applying benefits roller lash and then
6:54to finish off this look I'm just applying my lip color this is over a
6:57long lasting liquid lipstick in the shade
6:59sao paulo but I didn't want a matte finish i wanted something a little bit
7:03glossy so on top of that i took the Knicks sugar pie lip gloss and just put
7:09that right on top and then that completes this video I hope you guys
7:12enjoyed this tutorial
7:14thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already
7:16and I will see you in my next video bye
0:20hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look it's a very strong
0:26makeup look at least for me and actually had a mishap
0:30well this whole video was a hot mess but I'm still gonna post it anyway
0:33the foundation color didn't match because it's my self tan shade and I'm
0:37not tan right now and then
0:39while i was using my cocoa contour kit I was contouring with the cool tone color
0:43here and then I accidentally dip my brush into dark cocoa without looking
0:49and then stamped on my forehead here but i love the eye makeup so much this is
0:53the second time that I've done it
0:55um not on camera I decided to film it because I wore this I looked the other
0:58day and I loved it so I decided to film it for you
1:00since all my looks on my channel are very natural daytime appropriate i
1:04wanted to switch it up so this is the way it came up with and if you want to
1:07see it again as Luke then just keep watching
1:10so I'm going to prime my eyes using the Mac prep and prime 24-hour extent that I
1:14base this is by far my favorite color list primer
1:18this is an anastacio eyeshadow in the shade stone and i'm going to use this as
1:22my transition shade just buffing this into my crease so everything blends
1:26nicely on top
1:28this is a mac pro longwear pain pops in the shade genuine treasure
1:32I'm not exactly sure if this will limit in tissue not i bought mine on the back
1:36website
1:37not that long ago either so I just pop that on my entire lid and now i'm taking
1:42the morphe eye shadow in the shape deep skin and
1:46blending that into my crease some more just to warm it up then I'm taking make
1:50it Peaks white lies eyeshadow and highlighting with that
1:54now for my favorite part i'm going to add fix+ to my brush and I'm going into
1:58the Urban Decay eyeshadow in the shade
2:01dymond dog it's a super super sparkly eyeshadow it's one of their moondust
2:06shadows
2:08it's so worth it i love it so I applied that to my entire lid and I'm taking
2:12makeup geeks bit in shadow and on a tiny little blending brush
2:16I'm just precisely adding this into the crease and that's all I pretty much it
2:21and then I took deep skin again from morphe and I'm just blending everything
2:26out so things are nice and seamless
2:28I'm going to take um scheme' by makeup geek and white lies and layer them on
2:34top of each other in my inner corner and now i'm going to add just like a pop of
2:39color something a little bit different i decided to add some green eyeliner and
2:44this is from ga
2:45it's called their liquid shimmer eyeliner and this is in the shade links
2:50so i'm just applying a tiny little wing super easy nothing too fancy just a
2:55little pop of something so now i'm going to prime my face using be two-faced and
3:00hangover RX primer and then i went in with the covergirl stay luminous
3:04foundation the luminous foundation and then I realize oh this is not my shade
3:11this is my summer she
3:13a season but I just went with it anyway
3:18you know mistakes happen sometimes
3:22ok so i'm just going to blend that in and try my best now i'm going to apply
3:26some concealer just to see if i can help with the color situation so i'm using
3:32more than I normally do but this is the Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade
3:3515 fair and i'm just highlighting applying this under my eyes all over my
3:41face and I'm going to blend that in with a real techniques blush brush so usually
3:47blend my concealer in about a million times so i decided to skip over that now
3:50I'm going to take my two phase cocoa contour kit
3:53this is a real techniques setting brush and I'm going to set my under eye
3:56concealer using the light
3:58Coco shade which is like the whitish shade in the palette and then i'm
4:02setting everywhere else I apply the concealer taking this morphy pencil
4:07brush I'm going to take that eyeshadow called deep skin by more feet and I'm
4:10gonna blend that underneath my eyes
4:12this is an eyeshadow by NARS it's one of their duel and tend to the eyeshadows
4:16and I filmed this before the makeup geek dual chrome eye shadows came out so I
4:21would have just used in making pink one because it's much cheaper but i have
4:24been ours once i use it
4:26now i'm going to go in with the clinique chubby lash mascara
4:30this is like they're burgundy one and I think it gives a cool little twist to
4:34the look
4:35so that completes the eyes and now i'm going to go ahead and finish the face
4:39this is a foundation palette from mascara cosmetics I follow her on
4:43Instagram and I followed her blog for a really long time so this is a really
4:47really cool concept
4:49I'm going to take the brush that came with it and i'm going to use that
4:53contour shade at the cream it's a cream palette by the way i'm going to use the
4:56contour shade to just outline my face with that pointy part and then I'm going
5:01to flip the brush over and just blend out that cream contour this is the
5:05perfect shade
5:07because it has like that nice actually undertone so it's perfect for contouring
5:15now i'm going to go back into the tube a school contract and I don't know why I'm
5:18holding it out to the side like that
5:21I think that's super weird i'm holding out of them so I'm just going to start
5:25contouring my cheekbones with the azure shade in this kit
5:29I want something a little more dramatic and this is where accidentally put the
5:33wrong bronze on my forehead and I'm like freaking out like a you put the warm
5:37bronzer you're supposed to put the ashy one and then things went south a little
5:41bit but I hope and I fixed it a little bit
5:44so now i'm going to take the knee of urban decay blush is in the shade
5:49rapture I believe I have the correct name down below but i'm pretty sure it's
5:52rapture and this is a super dark blush but likely applied it's really pretty so
5:57that's what I did and then tie like my face
6:00I went in with the Natasha no glow palette in the shade 01 light and I
6:05highlight my cheekbones and my nose in any other place I would normally
6:08highlight so to finish off the look I'm going to apply this color pop ultra
6:14matte lip in the shade trap and then
6:16that completes makeup look I really hope you guys enjoy
6:20thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I
6:23will see you in my next video bye
0:09hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look i'm
0:16wearing right now
0:17I was gonna do a child to get ready with me I was all ready for a try to get rid
0:21of me i have my wine about my throat is killing me
0:23still trying to get over my cold you're probably thinking like wow you had a
0:26cold for a long time now but i'm actually pre-recording videos because
0:29i'll be out of town when you're watching this
0:31so I didn't want to talk too much in this video so it is in voiceover I'm
0:35sorry but I will be recording a get ready with me is more often like chatty
0:39get ready with me is I hear your request I will be filming those more often but
0:43today i wanted to use the mecca and jaclyn hill champagne glow collection i
0:48used the face palette
0:50it's amazing amazing i'm not going to do like a whole review because i know
0:54there's like a hundred videos reviewing this already i just wanted to show you
0:57this look I used the eyeshadow palette the face palette and the liquid
1:02illuminator and all that I totally think I overdid it with the glow i'm like
1:06super glowy but that's the point
1:08it's a globally collection so if you want to see how to get this really dewy
1:12summary bronze a look and just keep watching
1:15ok so i'm starting off by priming my face using the backup primer this is the
1:20backlight priming filter and then i went in with the back wha
1:24equi becca aqua luminous foundation i have to speed this part up because you
1:28guys for some reason I just take forever to blend this into my skin it's just one
1:33of those foundations I really have to work in for it to look as natural as
1:36possible but when I do it's beautiful
1:39we can see where i'm using is the Catrice camouflage concealer
1:43at first this was going to be a one brand tutorial like I was going to do
1:47only backup products but then i realized i was using a couple of other things
1:51that were in becca so it just didn't end up happening but I use a lot of becca in
1:57this video so I'm just popping that in with my sedona lace 217 brush
2:02this time I can see I'm going to use my trusty it cosmetics
2:11bye bye pores pressed powder and i'm just setting my under eye concealer
2:14setting my eyes because i also used that concealer kind of as a primer for the
2:19future
2:20I'm just setting anywhere i put the concealer basically that's what I'm
2:23setting
2:24I'm gonna take the becca shimmering skin Perfector liquid in champagne pop I love
2:29it is beautiful
2:31i'm using a sponge to apply this to the tops of my cheekbones and on my nose and
2:35all the places i want to highlight this is a sponge from the brand mascara but
2:39you can use any spongy Beauty Blender the Real Techniques sponge
2:43they work really well with liquid highlights this is amazing i highly
2:47highly recommend you get the liquid version of champagne pop it is stunning
2:52like I definitely liked it a lot more than I thought I would I mean I I know
2:55you don't like it but I love it
2:57so I'm just friends at my skin with my physicians formula butter bronzer but
3:01then I wanted something a little bit warmer so I took out my kiko desert
3:05dunes bronzer this is like one of their new summer bronzers i bought it on the
3:09Kiko website and i got mine in the shade warm and i just use this to warm up my
3:14skin a little bit and now i'm using of the mecca and jaclyn hill champagne
3:19collection face palette is beautiful this mirror is insane it's it's amazing
3:23it's amazing the blush i'm going to use amaretto it's kind of like am at a warm
3:28peachy shade beautiful i love this blush it was the first time I used it and I
3:33love
3:34it was beautiful to highlight my cheekbones some more i took a little bit
3:37of prosecco pop and then i apply champagne pop on top
3:41recycled pop is just a little bit to gold for me but the combination of the
3:44two is really pretty
3:46so lamb at the highlight ok so now i'm going to take the eyeshadow palette i'm
3:51going to take the shade cordial and i'm going to use this in my crease
3:55I usually do 1i off camera but honestly I was totally winging this look like I
3:59didn't even know what I was gonna end up doing huh
4:02so I just you know winged it I'm going to take the marc jacobs twinkle pop in
4:08the shade
4:09three shakes and i'm applying this to my entire lid kind of like a base for the
4:13eyeshadow and blending that out with my finger and then I'm going to take the
4:18eyeshadow named champagne toast and i'm applying that right on top of the base i
4:23put down
4:24I've heard kind of like mixed reviews of this palette I think becca like did
4:28something with the formula i'm not sure what the buzz is but i actually really
4:32like my palette i think the quality is pretty good i'm taking the shade cognac
4:38and i'm applying that on the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging
4:40them into my crease and then taking a different brush and puffing out the
4:45edges so that there are no harsh lines
4:48I do that a couple times go back into cognac and then just buff out the edges
4:58then I took the shade
5:02bordeaux and added very little of this to the outer corners of my eyes
5:10i used a Chardonnay in the palette to highlight my brow bone and my inner
5:16corners
5:17this is a makeup geek eyeliner full-spectrum eyeliner in the shape room
5:21area and i'm using this to apply to my waterline and then I take bordeaux on a
5:25pencil brush and kind of just buff it out
5:27I don't want my waterline to look to read so adding the eyeshadow and buffing
5:32that out kind of helps
5:33and then I took cognac and just did the same thing and then I skipped false
5:37lashes and applied tons of mascara for my lips I'm using the Milani lipstick in
5:42the shade
5:43Matt naked and that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching and
5:47please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye
0:00hey guys so today's video is a makeup
0:10tutorial on this look it's just a really
0:12glittery dark grey gunmetal smokey eye
0:16i'm using the gunmetal stack by not
0:19cosmetics i love their stacks I have all
0:22of them they're so good they are very
0:24very pricey but I feel like melt
0:27cosmetics there so innovative there so
0:29edgy i love Mel as a brand i will say if
0:32you're working with the gunmetal stack
0:34specifically you need to do your
0:36eyeshadow before you do the rest of your
0:37face makeup the last two shades in the
0:40stack these two right here this one is
0:42industrial and this one is gunmetal they
0:44have a lot of fallout a lot of follow
0:48even the top shade there's only one
0:49matte shade in the stack this one has a
0:52lot of fallout as well so you want to
0:54make sure you're doing your eyes first I
0:56did my eyes first and even I have some
0:58fallout on my face
1:00you have to be very careful with these I
1:01don't have that problem with the other
1:03stacks it's just this one specifically
1:04since they're kind of like pressed
1:06glitters their eyeshadows but they're
1:09very glittery and a framling if you want
1:11to see how to get this smoky eye and
1:13then just keep watching
1:14ok so I'm going to jump into eyeshadow
1:17because i already prime my eyelids
1:18eyelids are good to go and i'm going to
1:20take the shade assimilate from the melt
1:23cosmetics gunmetal stack and i'm using a
1:25fluffy brush and I'm just applying this
1:27into my crease and then I'm going to
1:29take my NYX glitter primer and with my
1:31finger i'm going to apply this to my
1:33entire lid
1:34I'm not passing the crease but I'm doing
1:36this because I went in with the shade
1:38gunmetal which is this shade right here
1:40and if i don't go in with a sticky base
1:42or like a glitter primer underneath
1:44there won't be much pigment like it'll
1:46just be a little glitters so adding the
1:48glitter primer really intensifies the
1:50eyeshadow now I'm going back in to
1:53assimilate on a smaller little crease
1:55brush and I'm really just buffing out
1:57this gun metal shade i will say it is a
2:00little bit difficult to work with just
2:01because this is a mat and we're trying
2:03to blend out a glitter it's kind of
2:05difficult but I did take my time with
2:07this i'm just going back and forth with
2:09the shade is so
2:10hey and blending up those edges I
2:12thought the look at me to just a hair of
2:14warmth so on a fluffy brush i took my
2:17physicians formula butter bronzer and I
2:19just blend it out the edges of the shade
2:21assimilate just so everything looks like
2:24a nice gradient to highlight underneath
2:26my brow bone I'm actually taking this
2:27makeup forever and 500 shade and putting
2:31that underneath my problem like i said
2:32to highlight then I went back in to
2:35assimilate on two different brushes and
2:37I'm just buffing out those edges it's
2:39just a lot of blending in the crease and
2:41since we did so much blending a lot of
2:43the glitter fell off so i went back in
2:45with gunmetal and just apply that to my
2:47lids and then I'm jumping into the face
2:50before I finish up the eyes
2:51this is a primer from the brand money
2:53it's their perfect 10 primer serum and
2:56I'm just testing that out right now and
2:57i'm also trying this primer out for the
2:59first time in this video this is the it
3:01cosmetics
3:02bye bye pores primer and so far so good
3:04it really did smooth out the skin i'm
3:07still testing it out but i think i
3:09really like it for foundation i went
3:11with i went in with the Loreal provo
3:14foundation this is the shade tool 3i
3:16believe and it just the undertone isn't
3:19right it doesn't match my skin perfectly
3:21but the formula is pretty good it gives
3:23your skin a natural finish for concealer
3:26i'm going in with my favorite this is
3:27the tart shaped concealer this is in the
3:30shade fair and i'm just highlighting my
3:32face and also covering up my dark
3:35circles and just blending of that in
3:37with a sponge
3:40to set my concealer i'm using the NYC
3:43smooth skin loose translucent setting
3:45powder and just I'm just setting all the
3:48places i apply the concealer because I
3:50don't feel like this foundation needs to
3:52be set the concealer dude so to finish
3:56off the eyes i'm taking a black eyeliner
3:58on my waterline and on my tight line
4:00this is the essence smoky black kajal
4:02fat chubby you know one of those control
4:05things it's really good and so
4:07affordable but for my lower lashline I'm
4:10just taking the shade assimilate and
4:12really blending that out and then I went
4:14into this wet and wild trio called plaid
4:17to the bone and i took the blue color
4:20and the trio and i'm blending this right
4:22on top of the assimilation shade to
4:24create kind of like a blue-gray color
4:25and I just blended that out and then I
4:28took some more of the Knicks glitter
4:30primer and i'm applying that to my inner
4:32corner so that i can go over it with
4:33this shade this one is called harsh tone
4:36white and with a little blush know
4:38little brush i'm applying that to my
4:40inner corners and dragging it onto my
4:42lid as well then i just applied some
4:45mascara and eye popped on some falsies i
4:47use the cocoa falsies in the shade Misha
4:50and that completes the I look for
4:53contouring i am using the cabinet quan
4:56sculpting powder in the shade light just
4:58to give myself a little bit of content
5:00and then I took the physicians formula
5:02butter bronzer on a bigger fluffier
5:05brush to really just bronze up the skin
5:07then for blush i took the Milania Rose
5:13blush in the shade awakening rose and I
5:16pop that on my cheeks i love this blush
5:18i bought mine on Amazon because i
5:20couldn't seem to find it anywhere i
5:21think it was limited edition but it's
5:23beautiful if you can find it get it and
5:26then highlight the tops of my cheekbones
5:27and my nose and all that good stuff i
5:29took the back of champagne pop highlight
5:32and just put in that everywhere as usual
5:35for lips and wanted a peachy color but I
5:37didn't think it was going to be a speech
5:39as this turned out this is the Kylie
5:42liquid lipstick in the shade dirty peach
5:44but it was a little bit to neon for me
5:46like it was a little bit unexpected i
5:47was a whole speech so I decided to take
5:50a nude gloss on top and I apply the dose
5:53of colors gloss in the shade undressed
5:56and then that completes this look

0:33makeup geek is what I was trying to say it's like an icy green with a really
0:38intense lower lashline i know a lot of people don't really like lower lash like
0:42a super intense or lifetime but i think it's so like captivating i love super
0:48smoky lower lashline so that's why i kept the top really simple no liner like
0:56just like two eyeshadows pretty much and then I focused the drama on the bottom
1:01so yes my hair is a mess and so is the lighting the lighting in this video is
1:05like really off I feel because i'm filming really late at night which are
1:10usually film during the day so I don't have any sunlight at all in my room
1:14right now so I'm sorry that the lighting kind of sucks anyway if you want to get
1:18this look then just keep watching
1:20so for primer i am using the Mac painterly Paint Pot i use this all the
1:26time it masks the veins of Maryland's and I really like that this shadows for
1:31making me call the eyeshadows are from makeup geek
1:33this one is called babyface and i'm just using this to set the excuse my singing
1:39i'm just using that to set down the paint pot now i'm taking high tea i love
1:45this eyeshadow i highly recommend it it's a nice like olive green but it's
1:51really pigmented it's really amazing i don't know i really really love it so
1:55I'm taking one of her oiled eyeshadows and look at that look at that fullness
1:58its amazing by the way i'm recording this voiceover really really really
2:02really late in the middle
2:03the night so my voice is like cracking anyway this foil shadows called charmed
2:08and I started putting it on eyeshadow i mean with a brush and then i just
2:11finished putting it on with my finger
2:14I'm going right back into high tea just to blend everything out and then I'm
2:20going to take ice queen and this is gonna be my brow bone highlight i like
2:24it because it's not a flat white color it has like a sheen to it
2:29ok so this is a brand-new product i just got it
2:32the marc jacobs looks like a pill that's why I was a doing that and see marc
2:38jacobs undercover coconut primer I got it just because it said it had coconut
2:45in it and I feel like I put on a little bit too much this is the first time i
2:48used it and it smells faintly of coconuts not too much but it is really
2:53hydrating it basically feels like a super intense moisturizer I don't know
2:57if it's as good as the two-faced one just yet
3:01and here i am looking for a brush to put on my foundation but yeah let's move on
3:06i'm going to mix these two foundations this is the Too Faced Born This Way and
3:10the look L'Oreal True Match Lumi mentally yes the true match Leumi ok
3:17it's really late guys
3:19I love mixing the two because the two-faced one just gives you a flawless
3:23finish but adding the Loreal one makes it a little bit do here so i noticed
3:29that i didn't really match my neck much i'm not as tan as i usually am so it
3:34didn't match my next I'm like trying to drag it down and I'm like me
3:39yeah the color it's a little off so i'm just going to add a lot more concealer
3:44than usual to try to blend everything out i'm using the Maybelline better skin
3:49concealer I can't stop using this I wasn't a big fan of it at first and now
3:53it's like one of my favorites i cannot solve using it so i'm just applying this
3:58all over my face like I usually do just adding probably a little bit more than
4:03use and with my signal is 217 I am blending all that out
4:10yeah
4:17i'm going to set all of the concealer with the maybelline fit me powder in 135
4:24creamy natural this is a real techniques contour brush by the way and i'm just
4:30using that to set everything ok so I'm gonna finish off my eyes and this part
4:36makes me cringe because you guys know I hate tugging on my eyes and I never
4:39really do but for some reason I did tonight
4:43this is the Milani shadow eyes chubby stick eyeliner thing in black and then
4:49I'm just smudging that out with like a little equal tools brush I'm going to
4:58work on smoking out that lower lashline this is dirty martini it's such a nice
5:02deep green i'm applying that right on top of the eyeliner and I put the black
5:08base so that it can look like a super super dark green so yes I'm just
5:13blending that out with a morphy pencil brush and I'm going to go into high tea
5:17this beautiful like great olive color and putting that right on top and then
5:21I'm just blending everything out for my inner corner highlight I'm using shimma
5:27shimma on a pencil brush and then I want my lower lashes to be like very
5:33volumizing so i'm using the clinic bottom lash mascara because i feel like
5:37it gives my lower lashes a lot of volume and then for my top lashes i just threw
5:45on some L'Oreal telescopic and that completes my eye look a lot of people
5:50complain that I don't wear falsies enough but I just don't wear them all
5:54the time it's not very practical for me i don't know i just don't wear it a lot
5:58but wear them a lot anyway I'm just warming up my skin before i go ahead and
6:03contour using the NYC son and bronze in Montauk bronze and then i'm going to
6:09contour my face
