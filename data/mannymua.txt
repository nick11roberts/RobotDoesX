1:17hi that's going into this video
1:22yeah
1:27ok guys so it's gonna get started on this one brand tutorial completely
1:32barren faced and I feel like I look like a damn making more out with his face on
1:36right now
1:37yeah i'm going to start clean slate poreless primer
1:40this is just my silicone e feeling primer for people to have liked more
1:44porous skin
1:46hello me how you doing my name is Manny and I of course problematic
1:50starting in the center just kind of blending outwards so for foundation I'm
1:53gonna be going in with the new Iranian force of the sea foundation retard
1:56obviously the heart one brand tutorial i got this recently when I was in hawaii
1:59was hard and they just launched a huge array of products and the rainforest
2:03foundation was one of them
2:04this is such a beautiful foundation I've worn it twice so far the only thing
2:07about it i don't really like is that I feel like I have to use a lot of
2:12foundation and to get to the coverage that I want because this is more of a
2:15baby
2:15I feel like a natural to medium coverage foundation maybe that's just me
2:19I'm in the shade light medium and natural I'm gonna start pressing in with
2:23the Beauty Blender all over my skin it does give you the most beautiful skin
2:27like appearance of for foundation a very glowing and natural-looking which is
2:31beautiful i love it even when I pile on a shit ton of foundation is still looks
2:36really beautiful really natural which I like
2:38I just like to have to use like to hold syringes of product to get like the
2:42coverage i want you know but then again i am a bully and I want to cover a lot
2:46that was one syringe and only covered up like this area of mine and I need one
2:49more syringe to do with the forehead and the nose
2:53maybe you guys don't have to but I do if your oil you want to go with more of a
2:57mattifying product underneath and set it with powder because it is going to be
3:00pretty glowy
3:03as you can see it does give a beautiful amount of coverage once you later it on
3:06look super super pretty very glowy very natural looking
3:10overall this is a beautiful a foundation that gets truly stunning
3:13I'm gonna go in with the tart I was going to clean water proof 12-hour
3:17concealer i really like this one - I want to use consider many times before
3:21which is a really nice full coverage stick concealer like you can see
3:25freaking full ask coverage is insanity
3:28I'm gonna use too much because this is a very very heavy weight and dense
3:31concealer reminds me of like the seven o'clock concealer like it's that
3:35and
3:35and full ask sick coverage concealer I'm in the shade
3:39fairlight like to highlight with them as well and i'm going to put in areas i
3:43need more coverage as well
3:44ok perfect and now we're going to go in and blend that out with the same and
3:48beauty bar that we just went in with for the face
3:50full ask coverage concealer i really do like this one a lot
3:53ya see that give me your grace that is what you should have so far as nice just
3:58blend it out
3:59highlighted and shit concealer and foundation on
4:03there's a lot of powder let me go with a smooth operator and which is like
4:07they're translucent powder to set the face with I'm gonna put that underneath
4:10the highest just really make sure that everything is set in place underneath
4:14the eye because again this is a very creamy concealer you want to make sure
4:17that it is it will begin to increase on you i can already see some of it wanted
4:21to crease and I'm like no bitch not today
4:23so just kind of going with a little bit of the smooth operator just a very much
4:25small amount because this is a white translucent powder and we don't want any
4:29crazy kind of flashback
4:31you know what I mean you know what I mean I know you do you've seen those
4:34photos of celebrities and you're thinking damn bitch poor yo
4:37yeah and then I'm gonna take a huge brush this is the morphe 41 just a big
4:41fluffy brush and kind of big fluffy brush of work i'm just going to dip it
4:43in a little bit of what i have on the cap of the powder and I just gonna go
4:47everywhere all over my face again just a very light layer just to make sure that
4:50everything is set in place this is a setting powder
4:53I wanted to make sure everything is nicely set
4:56so now i'm going with the BB powder by hard this is one of the newest
5:00foundation powders that they just launched its a creamy powder foundation
5:04and it's a light-medium neutral that's a shame that we end up going in with
5:07haven't tried to see this is first time this little tab for me and let's make
5:10little 10 below 10 so we're going with that same big be 41 and 0 from the
5:15outside of the face and then go in from there
5:18so like the darkest color gets deposited on like the hollows of my face already
5:22this isn't the main colors the grumbler shit
5:26it's fine we'll live at the end of the world if your little more tan than you
5:30are suppose to be this powder is pretty the hook up to take that down the neck
5:35because I do want to match my next to my face
5:38so the skin is looking pretty nice i'm not gonna lie i feel like this video
5:40with garlic this one brand tutorial is also like a first impressions video
5:43because i haven't tried a lot of these products like
5:46not try it a lot of these things so bear with me
5:49so how's it going with the hardest contour kit just like the cute little
5:53round 1 this might have you and I really do love it
5:55I'm gonna take a key to brush my morphe you brought up the skin I'm gonna take
5:58this really warm bronzy color so like vanilla and chocolate
6:04so then what ever get to the bronzing part i want to talk to you guys
6:07this like the bronzing part is where I start to get a little like stir crazy
6:11and i wanna be like you guys like what you guys doing today cause you're a
6:14sweet going like what's going on you know what I mean I don't know what it is
6:17about the bronzer that makes me get stir crazy but it does it truly does this is
6:21like literally the point of like no return for me where I'm like hey guys
6:24what are we doing
6:25ok cool what leave me a comment like I'm so weird i don't know why i almost
6:29forgot to bronze up my right cheek
6:31ok man you just walk around fucking won bronze or cheap one cheek bronzer
6:35what and then I'm going with the makeup the contouring brush and take a little
6:38bit of the darkest shade in the contrary it's just a little bit of contouring not
6:43too much as you want to go a little bit
6:46not to him not too easy calm down
6:49why am I talking like this what this brush like to go in first and they do a
6:52nice layer down and then I'll start buffing up so there's no harsh lines
6:56between the bronzer and the contour
6:59I'm not going to let people do like the harsh line but i'm just going to blend
7:03the two together let them marinate haven't done a 12 total in so long
7:09you have to know it's been so fucking long way since I've done one brand in
7:11the last night it will take forever and that was like Ohio go dude
7:15it goes a while so I'm excited to be doing this so many people have been
7:18asking me to 21 and it's finally here
7:21there's a spot on the right side of my face it's right here and rejects all
7:26pigment like whenever I'm bronzing on my skin or contouring like a rejected like
7:30I have to go over it so many times to try to even get the slightest color
7:33payoff there
7:34it's the weirdest thing you guys have that like where there's a spot on your
7:37face on your skin that literally rejects pick me and it doesn't want to take any
7:42color
7:43it's the weirdest thing it's so fucking annoying is what it is

8:50shimmery white gold and then this one over here on the far end is a really
8:55pretty pink champagne and the middle one is like more time at yellow and that's
9:00more like for the other I think I don't know I'm kind of confused by that when

9:41the pinky
9:42highlighters watch out and be weird for this shade on this side but it's
9:48stunning
9:49it's still fucking gorge trying to get more to pinky highlighters and find a
9:52dive into the world a little bit but I think it looks to be pretty cool so we
9:55have to face done that is it for the face I want to keep it like this i think
9:59it's really freaking good
10:00so I'm gonna go ahead and start with the eyes now let's get his eyes so I had no
10:04idea that tart even didn't I primer or like brow products like whatsoever i dug
10:09through my room like hardcore looking at all my PR something I found some stuff
10:12to use some pretty stoked about it like I didn't feel it was not expecting that
10:15at all
10:16so I found this tart the brow architect by pencil and it looks like the new
10:20anastacio brow definer like I've had this for like a year
10:25so I mean guitar diverse to fucking know i'm going to the shade deep I've never
10:30tried this not even once i have no idea how this is gonna work
10:33I was going to run this through my brows I don't feel like this puts a lot of
10:37product down though is also might be too fucking life my brows you guys like to
10:41watch these videos because I don't know what I'm doing with products that I've
10:45never tried before
10:46haha it's like this me back up if you guys have tried any of the tart brow
10:49stuff
10:50let me know in the comments below what you do like from them might come to the
10:53brows but I haven't tried any of the brown stuff whatsoever
10:55I don't have more brow products but it's the only one I have personally so let me
10:58know in the comments because I've tried anything else that they might have
11:01okay so I'm gonna keep it at this some nice furry brow
11:05how's it look be honest with me okay it just looks really light
11:09cool that's going to prime the is now I have the tart clean slate 360 creases
11:13primer I've never tried this memory for it Larry first time ever for suppression
11:17let's see how goes it comes out like a little white kind of paste ok let's try
11:21it out
11:21how is he like sunscreen so for the bodies were going to go in with the
11:24tartlet in balloon pilot just like that easy natural part of the ice i'm not
11:28going to do anything
11:29intense with the shadow what I want to do is a really cool different kind of a
11:33liner instead so i'm going to go very natural on the eye for things were going
11:37to grab a morph ep14
11:40the shade charmer charmers are very just white beige color and that's gonna go on
11:44the brow bone just to highlight the brow bone a little bit
11:47so now we're gonna do for the eyes and we're going to go in with a mixture of
11:50flower child and smarty pants
11:52a very light amount of those guys not on a e27 brush my morphe not just going to
11:57go into the crease because this look is solely focused on the liner but i do
12:01want to keep the crease a little more defined and whatnot so I think these
12:06colors mix will be really really really pretty perfect so now with Morsi and 433
12:10minute take a little bit of sweetheart
12:13actually that was like a nice dusty rose color that's going to go on the outer
12:17corner
12:18push that in to the crease super nice just dusty rose ish color I love that
12:23dusty rose like oh just zeros anything obsessed and then i'm going to go in
12:28with a little bit of color
12:30rebel which is like a chocolaty Brown and that's just going to very very very
12:34outer corner just a very small tiny amount of it nothing too crazy and
12:38taking that you 27 just blending that into the crease a little bit as well as
12:42keeping it very concentrated out here in the outer corner though not taking it
12:44too far in and then going in with a t14 one more time I'm going to grab charmer
12:48again that the collector on the brow bone
12:50I'm gonna put on the lid light layer of that all over the lid to really brighten
12:55and awaken the eye
12:56so for the shadow part we are done we're good on the shadows we're going to keep
12:59it at that so now for the fun liner aspect of it i'm gonna be going in with
13:02the new clay pot in mint gonna take that on a nice little tart brush and I'm
13:06going with this nice mint jelly laning

13:27so cute like I'm obsessed

13:31sharp and defined on the outer corner
13:33I just got the new so fine liner it's literally like the skinniest even see
13:37like you need to you can you can you see how small this tip is look at my I
13:39compared to it

1:19cool packaging like I did last time this
1:21is the cute little box the chi shadow
1:23pressed powder eyeshadow palette as you
1:25can see this is a rose gold finish on
1:28the outer packaging this time and then
1:30this one is named aspect to the last
1:31palette as well except this one is more
1:33of a rose tone that drips to it which is
1:35absolutely stunning and i love it
1:36just like last time I love the packaging
1:38that was so innovative and so-called
1:39some unique i love actually
1:41differentiated this palette with the
1:42last one by doing the different-colored
1:44oil drips to open up the palate same
1:46thing exact same component as the last
1:48county Palatine shades no mirror in the
1:50palette I wish it did have it this
1:51retails for $42 and we'll let you guys
1:53know whether or not i think this call is
1:55worth the price or not don't have done
1:58is worth it ok first shade first this is
2:00the shade and naked watching my finger
2:02it's very very very soft and lightweight
2:04and watch it with my hand to see that so
2:07basically it's a very very lightweight
2:09shimmer this is actually not my favorite
2:11shade in the entire Bunch actually it's
2:12actually
2:13my least favorite shade in the entire
2:14budget it's a very just lightweight tan
2:16shimmer color it's not like shimmery
2:18words like BAM shimmer it's like a light
2:19subtle like Sheen to the look at some
2:22everything but i believe that she did
2:24create the shadow in mind of people that
2:26wanted a very lightweight like light
2:28shadow on the lid which totally makes
2:30sense for me personally I just know I'll
2:32never use it so it's like it's annoying
2:33to me but it is a beautiful color it's
2:35just not my cup of tea
2:38cool equals the next shadow is going to
2:40be the shade a beach which is beautiful
2:42orangi tan brown shade right here just
2:45watching my hands feel it always feels
2:47fucking good just watching my finger
2:49right here beautiful it is BU to fall
2:56oh my gosh I really like the shape so
2:58much as no patchiness in this for me
3:00there's no passion as you can see that
3:01you can see there's no streaks in my
3:03hand it's a straight-up swatch no
3:05streaks it is in my crease and they
3:07looked great it blended fantastically so
3:09i really have no complaints is a very
3:10nice burnt orange tan color and that is
3:13a win for me guys ago that is a go next
3:17sheet is the shade at penny and this is
3:18a very rustic orange shade so so pretty
3:22to go right into orange watch over here
3:23come on
3:28so pigmented on my goodness the shadows
3:31are extremely smooth extremely soft i
3:34feel like the mats and this one are
3:35better than the maps in the last palette
3:37because again they are smoother softer
3:39they have less kick back and I really
3:41really like that this shade penny is a
3:42win for me is also in my crease right
3:44now it's like the orange shade you guys
3:45see my crease i love a nice rusty orange
3:48red tone that matter i love that
3:51next we have this shade LA which is this
3:53really pretty copper bronze shade is
3:56watch it this one feels so fucking good
3:59look at this look at this fucking shade
4:02this is a boiled finish what you guys
4:04know I'm screaming 400 bog look up that
4:11is a beautiful color is actually the
4:14color I'm going on my later right now i
4:15use it with a brush I didn't use of my
4:17fingers and it was it's this pigmented
4:18so I'm very very very much impressed
4:20that is my shit i love that shapes so so
4:22much
4:23so far the only clothes that i do not
4:24like is naked
4:26that's one of the four every other color
4:28is so far has been a go so next is the
4:30shade burgundy which is a very pretty
4:31pink it's actually literally like a pink
4:34a raspberry icee beautiful beautiful
4:38raspberry pink shade it's not bringing
4:40me whatsoever it's like a pink raspberry
4:43I really feel like highly picked it up
4:44in this formula impressed even fucking
4:48brain so that shade of Burgundy is
4:50another go it's absolutely beautiful it
4:51feels very very creamy and it doesn't
4:53pick up our like the other shades work
4:55so i definitely do think that this
4:56palette is already so much better than
4:58the last palette the last one I did like
5:00I just don't think was worth the money
5:01but so far this one is actually worth
5:03the money to me
5:04so we just watched five of the shadow so
5:05let's see the other four and see how
5:06they play out so now here is the shade
5:08do by filling it with my finger another
5:11beautiful foiled feeling fucking
5:13gorgeousness what it looks like i'll say
5:18the shades like a very pretty foiled
5:19rose shade as again a little bit of pink
5:22reflect a little bit of gold reflect so
5:24it's like a rose gold but much more rows
5:26than gold
5:26so I would say another banger is a
5:28beautiful shade i really wanted to put
5:29this on all over my lid but the golden
5:31was really just speaking to me so I
5:33don't you fucking call you know I was
5:35like the shimmers in this palette so
5:36much more so much more than the last guy
5:38like these tumors are actually like
5:40shimmering and intense other ones
5:41weren't as intense for me and I love of
5:43intense bold reflection next she is a
5:46shade of brick and this is another match
5:48shade this is a really pretty red in
5:50around this is much more brown though
5:52this might be a Swiss chocolate by Mac
5:54I'm just watch it right next to Dubai as
5:59the fucking horrible swag me try the
6:00king and try that again
6:03so what she looks like right here it's a
6:04very pretty red and brown again very
6:08similar to Mac swiss chocolate it's
6:09literally like the same fucking guard me
6:11it's hilarious actually on the outer
6:13corner of my eyes today to blend in with
6:15that really pretty penny shade it just
6:18looks so so nice and I like the blends
6:21so well the shadows here the mats are
6:23much softer than the last one which I
6:25feel is odd because you when it's softer
6:28there's more kick back but there's less
6:30came back in this palette that was last
6:31one I don't know I don't you did it
6:33it's like about next to the shade of New
6:34York and this is a what is this feeling
6:36it feels like a fucking
6:38just talking blue just focus group
6:41that's going to watch right yeah I can
6:43see that right there beautiful
6:47this is a true Toby bronze shade much
6:50more foiled the other politicians it's
6:52not as intense training and other colors
6:54are but it is another beautiful shade
6:56it's a really pretty deep bronze gold
6:59unless you have to hold gold so pretty
7:02another banger though I do think this is
7:04a really pretty color I want to put this
7:05all over my lid as well but i only have
7:07one leg
7:08I can't put that many colors I mean
7:10isn't New York is another go
7:12I don't know I'm saying that's ago but
7:13that's just my thing today and last but
7:15not least this is the shade almond and
7:17this is a really pretty dark dark dark
7:19very plush brownie reminds me a lot of
7:22Aphrodite from my palette on this
7:24beautiful deepened Flemish brown so
7:29pretty
7:30only very very very soft lightweight
7:32matte shade it's not intense by any
7:35means it doesn't feel bad and feel gross
7:37it's a very soft feeling which i really
7:38really enjoy it when it is almond and
7:40braker actually really really similar
7:42the only off by a couple of tones like
7:44they're very very very racist comment on
7:46the outer corner of my eye to deepen
7:47everything I don't have any black are
7:49different shadows on my crease or
7:51anything like that to make it a deep it
7:52was just using almond and it really did
7:54work to make it look nice and dark and
7:56intense and a lot of depth to look so
7:58again almond is another banger I think
8:00that turn out beautifully and this is
8:02the final look using the Kylie cosmetics
8:05burgundy palette obviously i'm wearing
8:07lashes right now and have liner on and
8:08add a little bit of highlight the inner
8:10corner and to the brow bone because the
8:12shadow naked in this palette is not my
8:13favorite the lashes i'm wearing actually
8:15enjoy this video
8:16Miami by lily lashes because you're
8:17curious why lashes i'm wearing Lily
8:19lashes may I mean you can use the code
8:20many ways to have somebody interested in
8:22it I just like this pair a lot of very
8:24wispy intense and they're so glam so
8:28again all in all this palette retails
8:29for $42 do I think it's worth the price
8:31i do this is actually a good how I
8:34really do like this one and I know I
8:35actually be using this a lot more often
8:37that i was going to use the other
8:38palette the only shot i don't like is
8:40the shade naked and that's just not my
8:42cup of tea
8:42I don't like shaped like that i don't
8:43like a very soft like almost not there
8:45shimmer I want either matter i want
8:47intense shine I don't want anything
8:49between that's just my personal
8:50preference though but i do think that
8:51this palette is actually worth the 42
8:52bucks
8:53unlike last time I didn't think it was
8:55worth it but this one I think is looking
8:57at just so it's so pretty
8:59these are kinda tones i love these are
9:00so beautiful to me this is like my
9:03fucking bread-and-butter this i write
9:04out on my bread-and-butter as I can
9:07remember I do think it is worth the
9:08price and i would buy this
9:10personally I was gonna buy it just so
9:12happened to be sent to me so I'm
9:13impressed with this pilot much more than
9:15I am impressed with the last one I feel
9:16like she picked it up and it's just
9:18better just what it is it's better it's
9:20actually worth the price is time and the
9:21other one is ending was so that's my

1:14like one right here is a little thumb
1:15click it and comment if you guys liked it as well I would really appreciate
1:17that yeah without further ado let's go ahead and get started on this one brand
1:20look I make a fabric
1:22hey guys okay cool so it's going to start this bad boy off
1:25I'm 15 had to be filming this video and she wasn't so long ago but you know what
1:29that are like the numbers when I only thing
1:32ok so it's going to start with the face of course my face is completely barely a
1:36moisturizer on and i'm gonna go ahead and start with primer for today I'm
1:39going to using the step 1 equalizers I think they are such amazing primers for
1:43the face i think they're freakishly bomb
1:45I'm gonna take the step 1 Glaser in smoothing and I'm gonna go in my t-zone
1:48this is such a great smoothing primer a type of the appearance of pores like
1:52stupid bomb
1:52I'm just on my nose and just go with one finger and like press it around and you
1:56are pores are big ass back and pulls of death
1:58that's what right ok and then we're going to take the hydrating one for the
2:02perimeter of my face but I feel like it helps my face like look less cracking
2:05less cakey so i put this on spots i have got more fine lines and wrinkles like
2:09this area right here is a smile too much
2:12the equal wages from AFF are meant to be used together with fellow equalizers so
2:15it's totally fine if you mix them together because it's going to totally
2:18work out
2:18in your favor trust a bitch cuz mama knows ok oh he's a profound you should
2:22i'm going to take me make a favor Ultra HD foundation is a new one they just
2:25launched and i'm going to shade 140 equals y 305 make a favor numbering is
2:29not my favorite because i think it's really confusing gonna take two pumps on
2:32the back of my hand a lofty popli is making two and a half
2:35okay i'm gonna take a Beauty Blender i was going to press out all over the skin
2:38I just started on my cheeks because that's what I like the most horse again
2:42and I like to fill up my pores with some foundation is a good for your skin
2:45problem not probably fucking not
2:47I think the coverage is better than the old one I think this one also lasts
2:50longer on the face in the old HD still make up for ever get done did good on
2:54camera wasn't freaking filming but what i did was i did an excessive step you
2:58don't need to this whatsoever i took the Makeup Forever HD stick it's more of a
3:01full coverage foundation stick and i put this on my cheeks
3:03this is going to give you more coverage this is a full coverage stick that gives
3:06you like really glowy like satin finish and we're gonna put in the t-zone the
3:10kind of highlight the face a little bit and then blend it out with the Beauty
3:12Blender you feel it blends out like so freakishly bomb is stupid again that
3:17step was not necessary but you know might have how to do it because Mama's
3:21extra a month extra
3:22now i'm gonna take some concealer I'm gonna take the full cover creme and
3:25shake number three this is like to have to make up for ever's though this was
3:28going to use and i'm going to use that with the beauty blender because this
3:30bitch is folk over to the but uh huh i'm going to press that in underneath the
3:33eye
3:34it's so pretty though oh my gosh i'm going to highlight with this - but use
3:37it very sparingly you don't need so much of it so don't like use a lot of if you
3:41don't need a lot of it
3:42take my beauty blender and blend out so you can also pick up the excess product
3:45because it is a full-coverage concealer and it's a cream so you don't want to
3:48work with it and you want to set it off so quickly
3:50I'm gonna take this eyeshadow makeup forever it's this one right here I
3:53really know the name of it i mean it on the back but it's kind of a bitch to
3:55find so I'm just going to leave it in the description box down below as an
3:58eyeshadow but it's kind of a yellow base i'm gonna use that to set my under eye
4:01me might as well you know what the powder to fuck about her feel that I
4:04shadows are so ridiculously nice spicy no rules to it you know anything . a
4:08little thing look makeup every little dated for me please tell me that you
4:12super cool PR think manatees were sold separately like us could buy these other
4:16things like your favorite influencers faces on them not be so freaking cool i
4:19don't know i think that's such a cool thing and I think it's so cool and
4:21makeup ever sent these out to people
4:22I'm so honored to have been sent one I think maybe forever is amazing
4:26forever if you want to have a collab great so we are now concealed and we
4:30have found each night and we are good to go now i want to go and set my face
4:33i'm going to make up for ever HD high definition powder this is the loose when
4:36I wish I had the pressed one but i don't but I'm gonna take a little bit on the
4:39back of the cap and take that with a more fiji 0 my holy grail powder brush
4:43just it's so good because you see pricing
4:47bubble bubble toil and trouble don't want to put too much fun because it's
4:51going to give you think that white flash back because it is a silica powder to
4:54have to be really conscious of that but just going to start pressing over the
4:57face with the HD powder hook
5:02I think that HD powder looks so pretty
5:05I'm going to take the maker pro finishing powder and 1 18 and I'm going
5:08to do on my neck just to kind of match my neck little bit better to my face
5:11this powder is just like a foundation powder and it's actually really really
5:14nice i use on my face sometimes too
5:16it's going to run that on my neck just down my neck a little bit on my ears and
5:20yeah that's all I got
5:22ok cool so now i'm going to bronze up the thing i'm going to make it forever
5:25map bronze powder and shade 20
5:27I talked about this before my channel for I think it's such an amazing amazing
5:30amazing bronzer and take down the morphe to come to run that in my bronze and
5:35areas
5:35it's not too warm to cool I think it's so beautiful and I like that it's very
5:39buildable this is such a buildable bronzer it's not like so happy or
5:42anything like that
5:43I just think it's so nice little bit on my chin a little bit down my fucking
5:48chin
5:50what is this on my chin yeah bitchin
5:53ja raha otherwise fucking job oh my god ax
5:59alright cool so we have some chronic like we have some nice dimension to the
6:06skin that the bronze look so freaking pretty interesting the bronze look so
6:09gorgeous so not for blush I'm gonna take the sculpting brush in the shade tents
6:12like a very nice pastel e pink color I'm going to just a little bit of online no
6:16not a light blush sleeping
6:18it's such a really pretty like fleshy kind of pink it's like so like you know
6:23don't know what that noise was but that's what I'm feeling
6:25perfect we are blushed I thought I want to write something about my start
6:29getting more like diva as you know like a lot of people have been noticing my
6:32videos like i'll be like in boy mode
6:33I'm like super like you guys that like doesn't like super children as soon as I
6:36start getting laid the foundation on associate the highlighter on like a
6:40bitch
6:41hey Carl what kind of thing you know so now for the house later I'm gonna be
6:43taking the pro sculpting 20 in the shade number two which um hi
6:47obsession with the on a morphine m510 brush just to highlight the skin I'm
6:52taking that gold color to highlight
6:53oh I'm just gonna go in I love this highlighter so much
6:56Joe how good it is a joke why don't you just more i forgot i don't you just
7:01enough
7:01okay great perfect so the face is basically done this is what it looks
7:04like the face is complete
7:05let's go and start getting into the eyes now okay so basically i saw and i did a
7:10look I did like almost the whole entire I look already but I hated it so much
7:14like my liner looks so fucking shitty that I took it all off and reapply
7:18concealer and everything so if you guys see like anything like cracking in my
7:20concealer it's because i like it off like this whole area already and i just
7:23replied so hopefully doesn't look too bad but I'm doing this again
7:26Alex look with shitty haven't seen me to all the time ok so whatever do now for
7:30that I love already primed my eyes and I already did my eyebrows off camera using
7:33the concealer and I used to that shadow that one shadow and I pressed it over it
7:37as well as the browse the brows I didn't have anything for making february's for
7:40the brow so just like you know what we just do them off camera because I didn't
7:42have anything from them
7:43I wanted like a little bit of browser but they have the Aqua seal and I didn't
7:46really want to use the questions that i want to go to flee
7:48so I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna take the e 27 my morphe and I running in my
7:52bronzer and i'm going to be using that as my transition shade know honestly
7:56like how i feel about bronze I just feel like they're big ass eyeshadows you can
7:59use bronzer as much as you want honestly as a shadow
8:01there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever I'm gonna run
8:03into my crease and your I should look something like this is a nice just
8:06diffused crease
8:07I went well sony oh I'm gonna go and take this beautiful cranberry shade
8:12right here trying Morello
8:14I think of everything everything on this morphine for three and very small amount
8:17of it i want to go to jam with this color because you can look real pink
8:21real quick okay
8:22I honestly love this color so much so it's like stupid how much I love it
8:26beautiful as soon as I saw it I was like I mean he's that just feather it forward
8:29towards the front of the eye i'm just being very light hand with I'm not
8:32taking too much most of it is deposited on the outer corner
8:35you're seeing this shade is so freaking beautiful it's stupid
8:38so I think that you 27 again and just blend out that color
8:42I'm going to be going in with this gorgeous palette for making favorites
8:45like the number one pallet and i'll take that middle shade is like a really
8:47beautiful like taupe color and I'm cheating on my finger
8:50I'm gonna play sat on my lady it's so step knee and then I grab the darker one
8:58right here with my finger again and just put it on the outer corner like just
9:01very slightly
9:02well just for some dimension on the lid still just a more dimension and then
9:06that same for 3 i'm just going to blend out the edges a little bit more and then
9:09with that same power I'm gonna take a little bit of the black on the import 33
9:12and then just place it on the outer corner only just for some more dimension
9:16again all this looks to be nice and blended very well you have a little bit
9:21of that pink like cranberry shades shining through not too much but i like
9:25it and then taking that you 27 again and blending out the edges taking that same
9:29banana in shade right here
9:30I'm gonna toss them out on the brow bone again just kind of clean up what I kind
9:34of messed up and with like the blending and whatnot highlight all over again you
9:37know on a more fee and 422 letting it downwards and the eyes top of the actual
9:42something like this
9:43I really like how this one turned out much better than the last one sheet damn
9:46shit
9:46okay great so now the tops of the thighs are done i think it came out way better
9:49than the other i did like oh my gosh you actually saw if you guys follow me on
9:52snapchat you guys saw it i bet you guys are like buff huh
9:55it was not you whatsoever so let me just go and finish the bottom of the high now
9:57I'm gonna take that same map browser
9:59I think if ever any e36 pencil brush my morphe I'm just gonna run underneath
10:02that I you need me to meet with is just going to be our transition
10:05I'll see we're not going to do very much to the bottom lash line because I wanted
10:07to be just focus on the top of the time or I'm gonna go back in with the artists
10:10palette
10:11I'm
10:11to take this shade down here one that we put on the outer corner of all right I'm
10:14going to place that on the outer corner of my lower lash line with that same
10:1736-pound like i'll give you that chance like dimension but it has like a really
10:20cool sheen to it as well and then just kind of feather that forward justin is
10:24really pretty coppery Brown shooting now with the same 36 brush just kind of dust
10:28the bitch off on a little drugged or something on your pants whatever take
10:31this icy shade right here and I'll put that on the inner corner of my eye as my
10:35inner corner highlight kids has like a pinky tone to it

10:42lashes already off camera just because it's curling your lashes you know you

0:55and yeah it's going to get into this video
0:59yeah
1:04ok so we are back with another man you anyway palette tutorial so excited about
1:10these well guys I just really really excited to be filming these so we're
1:13gonna do as many as we possibly can when we can
1:15so I have an idea in my head of what I've done it too so it's going to make
1:19that happen
1:20just go right into it works and jump right into the tutorial hop on in
1:24we are going to gray of beaches and cream on a more for me 27 brushes just
1:29going to go everywhere that I wasn't what i want to do a dramatic liner so I
1:32want the lid and the crease to be really really soft and not so intense
1:36a little bit on the lid whatever you just have left on the lid i'm already
1:39primed by the way I have a primer on and so don't even worry about it if you're
1:42thinking
1:43manual what are you doing bitch almost primed perfect what we have so far it's
1:48not very easy
1:49basically looks like nothing is on your lid crease so we're gonna be more p.m.
1:53for 33 brush and a frappe was not very nice maple brown color and I couldn't go
1:57very slightly into the crease
1:59not a lot though the reason I'm putting frappe into the crease because i want to
2:03give a little bit of dimension to the crease not that much and I want to keep
2:06on the outer corner specifically just super chill and not too much and then e
2:1127 and blending that out a little bit just cause I want it to be too hard I
2:14just want a little bit of dimension in the crease and that is about it
2:19so this is what you preach it look like very easy and nothing to him just a
2:22little bit of color in the outer corner and then we're going with the fun part
2:26we're going to be grabbing Mars of course that's my red shadow and then the
2:29palate and then you got any language that you have
2:32i'm going to be taking it the more feet and 51
2:35whoa what are you going to be taking the more p.m.
2:38158 which that's a nice liner brush is what it looks like it's really really
2:42good it's very small defined and i'm just going to pack that onto the
2:46eyeliner as if it's as if it's a gel liner pretend that the shadows gel liner
2:49and that's all we're going to do a zoom in a little bit more
2:52so you guys can see a little bit closer be careful with dipping into march
2:54because it is such a pigmented a shadow like I'm not kidding
2:58it's fucking crazy and we're going to act on it as our liner
3:04yeah
3:05ok and now we're going to make a little wing with it is whale just kind of
3:12sketch it out first
3:13the wing is gonna be intense because this is the main portion of this entire
3:17looks so don't be afraid to make it like a la boum wing
3:21did you know i am afraid you didn't know if you get too freaked out about doing
3:28this you can always use tape and tape is a really good method to use when doing
3:31this you can just pound on a bunch of shadow and have like the tape make the
3:34wing short but i'm just gonna use a little bit concealer to clean up after
3:36anyway so don't worry about it if you think it's like a little intense for you
3:41you can do it I promise luckily the shadow is so fucking pic with you that I
3:49can just glide it like as if it's an eyeliner see that shit to use even looks
3:53so sick ok next time then
3:55okay great so we have both of the eyes done at the top at least
3:59so this might be taking manual you have a little bit more color in your crease
4:02then what we remember while a bitch fuck step
4:05ok so what happened with I was curling my lashes on camera and I was calling
4:09really close to the lash like the lash line of course
4:12and like I stopped calling and then i went i moved upwards to curl like again
4:16and then some of the part on the top of this transferred to my lid the red and
4:21I'm like okay so i had to just going to work with some of the right in the
4:24crease is kind of blend it out
4:26I think it looks totally cool i love it i think it looks awesome
4:30I am not mad at the mistake you know sometimes mistakes are really cool but
4:33you want to keep it like dark brown
4:35just keep the five pain there be careful with the left with this because it will
4:38transfer
4:38apparently so - be careful with it but if you don't mind a little bit of pink
4:42in the crease
4:43I don't at all I looking so whatever type on house of lashes iconix on the
4:48eyes
4:48I'm starting to really like these lashes a lot like I've been wearing a lot more
4:51recently and I think they look really really really pretty special with this
4:54look when I'm just doing a liner basically the whole look
4:58so yeah I like it okay great so it's going to want to the bottom lash line
5:01I already did the mascara knowledge it off camera the we're going to grab
5:05Knicks cocoa eyeliner eyeliner and lip liner pencil course we're going to use
5:11cocoa lip liner
5:13and I'm going to the waterline this color is so freaking pretty it's like a
5:18red into Brown will take a little bit on the lashes as well and then just grab
5:23any pencil dress I'm grabbing the e36 buy morphine just kind of blending that
5:26out a little bit before it completely dries
5:29I'm gonna grab a little bit of Sora on that same 36 and blend that out a little
5:32bit just to give me some nice warm like cocoa color back
5:36I'm gonna grab a more feet 40 3 and take Aphrodite which is the dark plum not
5:41gonna go too close to the lash line
5:42just give me a really good amount of definition and dimension
5:46just make sure it's a lot darker by the lash line and then once you pack on with
5:51that color go ahead and blend out with the e36 again just to make sure there's
5:56no harsh edges as I was blending away my lower lash line
6:01I decided you know what i want to do a darker in a rim
6:04not really i'm not really feeling the like reddish brown i'm going with more
6:08of a true brown i'm going to mr. right now by the bomb in the shade
6:13bill a bill I don't feel like it's a little bit too
6:16right on the water line you know I don't look like I have a disease not feeling
6:20that look right now so we should go in with that right now I'm just not very
6:23lightly go over the color already have down just make a little more chocolaty
6:26and not has read and I'm feeling a lot more
6:30I am feeling that a lot more and that is the final I like this one looks like
6:34this is going to turn out to be i absolutely love it
6:36such an easy look you guys want you can always highlight the inner corner of
6:39your eye as well
6:40should we do it I think we should come on I'm gonna take the morphe am3 26 and
6:46Artemis and just apply a little bit to the inner corner
6:49it was a little puppets on a son named and now we're calling it a day

0:15you guys enjoy your scene because that's what this video is I've been getting
0:18tons of requests to do more different dramatic colorful looks and i know this
0:21is not think the most dramatic look at that most colorful look but i think it
0:25turned out really really cool and I feel like it's it is a very wearable sunset I
0:28and because we are getting more into spring and summer I wanted to go with
0:32some spring summer e-type looks

1:17what's up I'm anyway and it's my child and let's go and get into this really
1:21cool sunset e-type I
1:30so it's going to get into this video I already did my face basically I was like
1:35you know what I'm doing my face a little blah lately and just switch it up a
1:37little bit and have one of the new more college I really want to use today so
1:40I'm like let me incorporate that somehow in today's videos that's kind of what
1:44I'm doing today
1:45just for reference already pie my lids and I have my eyebrows done already so
1:48that we're just going to go in with shadow solely i'm so excited using this
1:51palette i'm so stoked i literally just got it today and I cannot handle like a
1:55happy today it's this bad boy
1:5730 50 in all mad are you joking
2:01I'm so excited to be using this I'm gonna go in with this shade right here
2:05it's a nice like to come mustard the orange to master any orange honey morphy
2:1027 and we're gonna run out into the crease as a nice transition shade for
2:14the rest of the shades that we're going to be going anyway
2:16shit is peg mented right away on my gun I'm taking that all the way into inner
2:20corner and I'm doing windshield wiper motions as well as circular motions
2:24towards the end or have a little bit extra skin to work with out here
2:28this is a transition color so again you don't need me to like meet with it
2:31whatsoever
2:32once we have that nice mustard yellow orange shade down I'm gonna be taking a
2:35new make a deep shadow called the tux in son
2:37it's just a nice like just like a nice corally pink shade which i think will go
2:41so nice with my idea of what I want this look to be um I'm going with the
2:45morphine and 43 and just blend that into the crease basically right on top of
2:49that morphine shadow just to give it some more dimension last time i'm going
2:55slightly lower than I have that orange shade but still like basically on top of
2:59it just to give it another added dimension to look and if you feel like
3:02you're going to hand with the tux and sun or whatever color you using i'll
3:06just go back in with that burnt orange shade from morphe on the same brush and
3:11blend up those edges to make sure that we do have a nice gradient and blend and
3:14you should have something like this
3:16now the tux and son is now a little bit lower and you can see there's a nice
3:19like orangie pinky gradients coming on and I'm digging it
3:24I'm thinking okay so now i think i'm gonna go in with this really cool darker
3:28burnt orange shade down here and that same morphe 35o palette and she just
3:33looks really nice like a burnt dark pinky-orange i'm judith on the same am
3:37or PM 433 brush
3:39and we're going to put that into the crease on the more outer corner and I
3:42can go as far in
3:43I just want to keep it on the outer corner mostly to make sure there's a
3:46nice gradient with this look I know I want to go with the shower because it's
3:49super nice pretty dark orange pink shade as you can see he's having a little bit
3:54more dimension to it is giving it more like a Firebird kind of feeling you know
3:58I'm keeping that lower than the rest of the colors between every single step
4:02just go back in and playing with a t27 to make sure there's no harsh lines or
4:06edges so what you continue to blend you have something like this so far
4:10so now we're going to take this shape make it was a brand new one from them is
4:13called fashion addict which is a nice just purple like a light lavender purple
4:17shade on a morphine 36 and go on the outer corner of my eye
4:21so we can have some more dimension and depth to this look I wanted to be like a
4:23really cool like sunset I like i was saying we're gonna have purple out here
4:27give it a different look we're actually going to combine that with taboo also by
4:31making because i feel like this color it's not dark enough and i want to a
4:34little bit darker purple
4:35I'm gonna go about two-thirds in keeping this area is completely bare because
4:39that's a br lid shade and you have something like this so far not going to
4:43do that I the great so that's what you look like now once you have everything
4:47blended out so now for the lip color i decided i'm going with a new shadow by
4:50mikey called Sin City and it's just a nice just boring g gold and all I can't
4:55really explain it as like an orange gold shade on a morphine am
4:58- 10 I just found out about this brush I just been using a non-stop so I'm going
5:03to load up the brush I'm going to look at the shadow but the brush and I'm
5:06going to pack up on all over the lid
5:09it's a really pretty orange e-gold I thought would go so nicely with this
5:12look I feel very festive I feel like a toucan awesome she should have something
5:15like this now what is all blended out
5:18so now we're going with the bottom lash line you see I kind of finish off with
5:20the top but right now i'm going to the bottom lashes I feel like it was just
5:23much easier together and have the shadows out so why not you know
5:26so I'm going to do is go back in with the Tuscan Sun shadow one more time on
5:30the e36 and start taking that out here and basically doing what i did on the
5:34top on the bottom lash line and literally just combining the two
5:38I would take it pretty far into the inner corner I want to look like the
5:41blend never stopped just can't just always just go up together you know
5:44so now we go back in with the fashion addict shadow on a morphine be 43 and
5:49that's going to go on an outer
5:50owner and we're going to make sure that we just bring out the nice purple tone
5:53back to it same thing and then going back in with taboo again a nice dark
5:57purple plum shade
5:58I'm going to do the exact same thing with the e 43 and make sure that the
6:02bottom of the lash line
6:03does the exact same thing at the top just kind of feathering it all together
6:05making sure that's all seamless and blended easily
6:08that's only going about halfway in rather than the entire weigh-in because
6:10i want to keep all the drama and exaggeration out here on the outer
6:13corner and I bring it too far in then blend out those edges to make sure
6:17there's no harsh lines and then take a little mac , graphic pencil a memorable
6:21line of the waterline with that now carlashes and put some mascara on and
6:27once you get the eyelashes on as well
6:30this is the final I love you
6:38and by the way the lashes I'm weighing our Russian black by new bounce some
6:42really cool - because they are very dense on the outer corner and fade in
6:45and go a little bit more sparse as you're going in so it's a really nice
6:47outer corner lash which is what i was going for with this look
6:51and I put a little bit of the most lightest color from the 3500 matte
6:56palette on the inner corner it's like a matte white highlight just I just wanted
6:59to add that just give it more brightness to look and that is it for today's video
7:03i hope you guys enjoyed this
7:04I look I know I didn't do a full face in this one because I was trying to save
7:07some time and film another video right after this so i can have more videos for

0:06times
0:07so basically this video is going to be another one of my installment of my one
0:11brand makeup tutorials
0:12the one that I did on nick's cosmetics because I no idea what I'm talking about
0:15I'll leave a link down below i'm starting a new series on my channel
0:17about doing one brand tutorial and this is my second installment of it using all
0:22benefit cosmetics which I am so excited to be using is over it's a 44 year and I
0:27would go to benefit for things all the time i used to go to benefit for
0:31everything and I love benefit products this is gonna be a lot easier to do
0:34because it's like i used to use that for all the times I never really use the
0:37Knicks like in the tutorial you guys saw like I was like not liking some try to
0:40find anything like it you know but this tutorial i have used better products i
0:43love benefit products I knew that wasn't like it already so I'm just like
0:46treading in some good water and on land
0:50yeah so this is going to be much more on the natural side much more glory much
0:53more use for much more just like pretty everyday how to make up I've been
0:56getting tons of requests to do more of a natural makeup look is much more natural
1:01than what i do you guys want to see how I achieve this more natural glow a
1:05pretty everyday look like I'm watching if you guys don't like it
1:09I'm screaming at you clearly other than that I'll get back to the tutorial I'll
1:16see you later bye everyone
1:19ok cool so we're going to start with our face completely clean and washed just
1:24going to the shower right now
1:25I went ahead and trimmed my beard and shaved coming or going from all that
1:29natural
1:30um if you're a girl which ninety-two percent of you are you don't you save
1:34your
1:34hey but if you're not you're a boy like me you don't shave it either . wife
1:40first and we're going to with is the Porefessional primer you guys have seen
1:44this on my channel already
1:45I love this primer for me specifically because I have more oily combination
1:50skin and this primer is amazing for people that are more oily combination
1:53and have really porous pores which I do
1:56I'm just concentrating them most of the product in the center of the things and
2:00blending our work with my fingers
2:02I don't need too much of this product is needed towards the center because I get
2:05oil in the t-zone and have normals Barkley
2:07ours and the t-zone is not the time mom is not the time
2:12I love this primary personally if you're more on the dry side out of here gonna
2:15like it that much because I mean its memory with a more oily and have really
2:19problematic pores so if you are dry and you have nice skin they don't have big
2:22pores
2:24it's not the primer for you listings now i'm gonna go ahead and go in with the
2:28hello flawless foundation since you're going for more of a natural look I'm
2:31just going to pump up of it on the back of my head actually make that two clones
2:34can make that one
2:37make that one that's too much this color I'm using his pedal so let's hope that's
2:41Michael it's like the second two lightest what's going on with the Beauty
2:43Blender and having it on
2:45I'm gonna go and start the center of the face and blend outwards that will give
2:49us the most natural finish I feel you're just going to concentrate more of the
2:52product and the T zone where you most need coverage and then you should kind
2:55of blend out the rest of the product outwards
2:58I'll i love this foundation like this foundation because it's lightweight but
3:03it gives you a nice amount of coverage you know it's like a nice medium to full
3:05coverage
3:06I think maybe two letters too wet oh my god it's like taking off the product
3:10that I'm putting down because it's so wet
3:12bitch apply a little bit down the neck as well
3:16perfect now we are a foundation down so we're going with a number one
3:20erase paste by benefit I i love the erase paste good thing with the race
3:26paste that you need a very tiny amount of it that you need like nothing
3:29trust me like a little bit goes along with this product reviews are clients
3:32all the time
3:33that's a flora and they would actually love but you have to teach them how to
3:36use it this is one of the product because it's so thick and creamy you
3:38really need a blended out and said with the powder or it's going to be too heavy
3:41i'm using a Beauty Blender just kind of blend it out just to kind of mask my my
3:45blue circles you know that is like a nice salmon undertone to it
3:48so really helps cancel out the blue hues and i'm not going for a really dramatic
3:52highlighted look I'm just really covering up the dark circles
3:55I'm just putting in the inner corner I really just pressing it in with the
3:59Beauty Blender
4:00I think works so freaking good I counseling out like any like darkness
4:04I absolutely love this stuff but again you have to use a very sparingly if you
4:08just use a little bit
4:09blend it out if you want more a little
4:10more ok trust me trust the bitch cuz I know
4:14perfect we're looking a little more fresh now i'm going to get the hello
4:17flawless foundation powder and never settle pedal never settle pedal well I
4:22like that look mighty mite don't like a man linked on several so i'm actually
4:26grab a more feet and 500 which is like a really huge just very flimsy brush
4:32preset in to this t-zone area because i don't want a lot of power i want this
4:36look to be more in the natural site as we talked about earlier also set the
4:39under eye area
4:40this brush is great because it's only just fluffy and you know it all too much
4:43product you know deposit you want product so we're going to use the wats
4:46up
4:46basically it's a cream champagne gold highlight and we're just going to toss
4:50that on to the high plains of the cheekbones
4:53Oh Oh bitch I love that
4:59and then we're going to kind of fit in with a more PGA Tour just gonna kind of
5:02press it on very lightly to give us a nice natural glow
5:05oh my god I love this will give you this really pretty gold in champaign glow to
5:11the skin with this all I literally was alright pretty or anything let's go
5:22ahead and just coolin into our contour areas we're going to use that same 135
5:26underbrush
5:26who's the meeting especially I don't pick up too much product and I don't
5:28want to pass it too much i mean i'm not going to go for a contoured look this is
5:32much more like just kind of bronzy glow be natural and a subtle dusting and the
5:36temples
5:37this is very hard to write like this is natural for me like bitch this isn't
5:40that true it is gonna get it
5:42shit i'm just gonna dusting the rest of the powder down my neck because i want
5:46to match my neck more i don't i don't like the smell of the powder I felt it
5:51smells like black licorice maybe i'm trippin
5:54it's mostly liquid is a lot of people of the licorice that black liquor smell
5:58i'm not one of those people that's all
6:02it's all so I'm going to have a little bit of blush we're going to grab the
6:04rocket or blush which i think is stunned needing same brush to pick up too much
6:09product doesn't deposit too much product and i think that if you're more on the
6:12natural side there's like this really cool
6:14we're going to do some blush on very lightly
6:17yeah
6:18this pitch like that when I was just before my mom got this blush and she's
6:22like almost completely done with it so funny
6:24this blush i think is really great for more of a just natural everyday pretty
6:28glowing look you know
6:30yes glow coming through glow gag
6:34we're going to the brows now we're going to grab the benefit gimme brow which is
6:37in the color medium deep which I love this little bad boy it's like looking in
6:46there was some kind of pushed out through our brows are going to more of a
6:49natural look
6:50I think this is a perfect little product because you just want to do still a
6:53little bit of the bride wore nothing to crank clean is cleaned up everything
6:56looks
6:57don't you know who I love this brow gel
7:01this is like my color too but that's pretty good for just a little tiny bit
7:04of brown gel that's this late
7:06it's like an Estancia stuff like this is good now we're going to clean up the
7:09brow with the gimme brow eyebrow pencil and we're going to really just put that
7:14in the arch of my eyebrow and that just kind of clean up make everything a
7:20little more highlighted in the busy like a cream pie light pencil
7:24I'm just use my finger i'm too lazy to do anything else we need my finger to
7:26blend it out
7:27just give a nice subtle brow bone highlight this pencil might not be for
7:32someone that's like darker and complexion
7:34even I mean it's like pretty pretty white I mean blends out like a dream
7:39the shipments out bomb I love benefits stuff honestly this is so much easier
7:43than doing it like when they did the next one
7:45I hadn't tried it like any other stuff and just on that
7:49ok you want to stop sweating I got to all my fans and literally like have a
7:53moment of like silence in the fan blowing in my face because my guess is
7:59Wayne store right now I don't know what's wrong with me
8:01ok so we're going to go ahead and do primarily this is the state don't stray
8:05primer for the lid little twisty little dough for its a little cute little thing
8:10to do is just a little bit
8:12I'm very all about a very tiny amount of private facility and just letting it out
8:15because if you use too much primary it just does the complete opposite effect
8:21like that and just off center crease so easy to blend great crease color
8:29now we just have a nice little bit of definition on the outer corner
8:32does anyone on the side this is like the most natural i think i've ever been on
8:37my channel things like a feeling you
8:40and now for the part that makes the most excited for because i feel like this is
8:42what really makes it look more on the natural site for me at least this is the
8:46new benefit roller lash mascara i absolutely love this freaking mascara
8:53the way that they tell you to use this on the box until you want to use the
8:56site that has a car that's like indented and like hook it on the base of your
8:59lashes and kind of wiggle up and I supposed to use so it's going to do that
9:06another transfer yeah that's a mascara with a just a nice one little later i
9:13think that it really doesn't amazing amazing amazing amazing job of giving me
9:16more length and more fullness and that's going to apply some on the bottom as
9:19well
9:20this shit is gone for the bottom too much because that's a look at some
9:27mascara
9:28only I don't my window and started a little bit more of a background noise
9:32now but man I was sweating more than a directly not a red carpet like I was
9:36blue panties
9:38ok ok cool so this is what it looks like with some mascara on I love love the
9:45massacre I think it's freaking sickening and you guys know I wear false lashes
9:48like all the time
9:50my lashes are really like they like to point straight down so i really have to
9:53crawl on my crazy just to get any kind of curl
9:56yeah i think that they turned out pretty good for just the mascara like this is
9:58good for me the real good for me
10:00I think honestly this mascara is better than no they're real mascara i think
10:03it's so so good i love it I love it
10:09just do a little be done so we're gonna do is we're going to grab the the been a
10:14bomb in the shade

0:21believe and it feels like it has like this is really soft pink belt eat I
0:25packaging just so pretty i believe that the pans in this palette are actually
0:29larger than their previous pants on the previous palette so it is a little bit
0:32more expensive i believe the other ones were usually like 35 36 this one is 45
0:35414 shades but I really don't think that's unfair whatsoever and this is
0:40actually a permanent part of them so I'm so excited for them actually live on
0:44associate brand i think they did such a beautiful amazing products oh um
0:48this look is inspired by someone on Instagram hold on let me find it
0:53this island I going i was actually inspired by Sophia LCS makeup on
0:57instagram i leave a little photo of her right here of her look she's the same
1:00exact palette as me and I saw on Instagram on a chg we posted her and i
1:04was like dude I'm obsessed with this looks so much that was like I need to
1:08recreate this for my followers on youtube because not always our Instagram

1:15it on youtube and learn how to do it yourself

1:39welcome to my channel and thank you for being here
1:41so it's going to get into this really beautiful soft modern renaissance I look
1:53let's go to get started on today's a video using the Modern Renaissance
1:58Palace - Oscar Beverly Hills you guys when I open this package
2:02I was so beyond excited you guys saw me on snapchat
2:06I was living I was waiting outside for hours gagging I was gasping for air
2:09i die and i came back to life it was everything so this palette is actually
2:12amazing the colors are fucking gorgeous
2:15so it isn't going in I'm taking morphine 27 and I'm gonna go in with golden ochre
2:20which is a nice just blew jariabek the the powers are really pigmented
2:27everything a mixture of golden ochre and burnt orange and i'm going to be 27 and
2:31go into my crease very lightly
2:32Anastasio shadows are so bomb and it's funny because in the beginning when we
2:37first launched I shadows they were nice like they were good but they were
2:41definitely showers but they weren't like my go-to favorite ones i don't know i
2:44just didn't like them as much as I like to other shadows but now it's even
2:47coming out with I would have been so nice so creamy so blendable and i just
2:51love them
2:52ok so now i'm going with Morsi and 43 I'm gonna mix red ochre and regular are
2:58no real car rigged real guard I don't know how to say them sorry guys
3:02realgar and red ochre and that's gonna go in my crease is paula was inspired by
3:06Renaissance paintings and I'm sure these are probably named after some paintings
3:10or some people that made the paintings who fucking knows to be honest I'm not
3:13really that well versed in that one of this match i'm not so scholarly may I
3:18went to college but i'm using my college degree now
3:21no I'm not so we're going to push that into the crease what we have the
3:24transition change will never set a little bit lower
3:27not too heavily just very lightly keeping the most people on the outer
3:30corner because that's what the photo is the outer corner of the most amount of
3:33pigment just taking morphine 43 and blend that out myself I wasn't recording
3:37the entire time so don't like so scared that that's not recording and I have a
3:41panic attack moment they're like wait why am i recording so now i'm going to
3:45go in with the shade Venetian red
3:48and this is a really cool like cranberry shade I think it's a little shimmery
3:52tool that has a little bit of shimmer to it and I'm gonna put on the outer corner
3:54with a more fiji 27
3:57this is a pencil brush I've been searching on more of his website for the
4:00e36 can't find it i think it's being discontinued so i'm trying to use other
4:03alternatives for you guys to another pencil brush like it the morphe g27 as
4:07another great alternative for the e36 because i know it's really hard to find
4:11so we're gonna put that on the outer corner just to give me that cranberry
4:16tone back to the look and bring it may be about one third of the way and barely
4:20bring it in and then just continue to blend that out as you can see it turned
4:24a little more cran
4:25I'm really digging the cream color so once you blend it out to your liking I
4:29think it looks pretty nice right now it's nice and blended my crease is
4:32looking defined in Chrissy I'm gonna take the shade
4:37cyprus number which is like a dark chocolaty Brown have one doing a very
4:41small amount of that on that same morphy pencil brush i'm gonna be doing a winged
4:45liner with this look
4:46so it's not going to be like a crazy amount just a very small amount on the
4:50outer corner just to add a little bit of definition and I'm just pushing that in
4:55with that morphe brush very very lightly because i really don't wanna take away
4:59any of that cranberry tone that we have I think it looks so nice
5:02take that and 43 and blend that out slightly awesomes we have everything
5:06blended out tonight I like how it's looking
5:09we are serving tuna on a platter realness fish four days fish four months
5:13fish for years
5:14okay with that so now i'm gonna go in a way the primavera
5:18on a more fiemme - 10 amazing packing brush you can always use the one that it
5:23comes with it because it does come with the packing brush but i like the more he
5:26was little better a little bit softer
5:28no tea no shade at all usually power brushes i'm not really the fan of ever
5:31so we're going with this pushes them to 10
5:34we're going to pack primavera all over the lid it's a nice soft like golden
5:38chain of took a beautiful golden champagne
5:42no I love and on the inner third I'm gonna take it from here which is a very
5:47light almost pinky Shane
5:49let's go into a corner as well a little bit on the lid blend it into the
5:54previously shade and then just blend between the edges with a morphine for
5:58three the same one that we've been using this because it's easier it's already
6:01there
6:01ok awesome this with the top so that I should look like now it's looking very
6:04pretty very just absolutely
6:06soft and dainty but very great gorgeous i'm gonna go ahead and do eyeliner I'm
6:10gonna take the kat von d super high liner and just do a wing with that
6:13honestly trooper my cabin day just might go to favorite eyeliner it's so easy to
6:16use
6:17you get a sharp line a very very easily it's a very black I just really really
6:20do enjoy this eyeliner going to do when we usually do it
6:24okay great so now we have the I later on it should look something like this is a
6:32very easy not too intense not to to bowl of a liner
6:36I don't know that's too bold for you but the liner however you would like to do
6:39it i just like to do I have it like this is actually really subdued liner for me
6:43so much and I think we're pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead and do the bottom of
6:46that lash line now on the photo says that all she used was love letter
6:50so I think that's where we're going we're going to take just love letter on
6:53the lower lash line
6:54I'm gonna take that same g27 and dip it into love letter which they really
6:57pretty like blemish pink actually something I might mix more than just
7:00this color but for now let's just try this
7:02I don't know who lives here so we can use that
7:08this color is stunning
7:12click crowd and you can take a little bit of the golden ochre and when the
7:17underneath this part just give me a little bit more with seamless blend and
7:21then i'm going to put the colour-pop lip liner in the shade and Lori any burgundy
7:26eyeliner will work I just can't find any burgundy liners right now remember in
7:29the underneath the lash line
7:30burgundy imac would work great too . this color would be absolutely perfect
7:37for this look okay go over to go finish that off camera okay I'll be right back
7:40ok so now this is the final product I have the lashes on my iconic by house of
7:46lashes and I thought that this would be such a pretty lash with this look
7:49because everything is really just like elongated and there's a wing it is an
7:52outer corner and i'm done with the ice so I'm going to be guided to see what
7:55they look like up close
7:57okay great so now that the eyes are done we're going to continue on with the lips
8:05now I'm gonna take a lip liner and lipstick is actually the most expensive
8:09lip come by thing I've ever done on my channel so they do it still
8:13yes I should I well something the charlotte tilbury lip cheat in the shade
8:16iconic nude and this is a nice neutral
8:19asian nude shade to the pine
8:22so this is actually more like a brown beige lip liner and I don't ever go for
8:27the cyclic ketones soho this is a little different for me
8:31and once we r lip line and we look like actually that from the fucking cell and
8:35from the value we take the YSL lipstick in the shade number 10
8:38Samantha this is Samantha always talk about the shade and i bought this in
8:42Canada but you know what if i'm gonna buy this is all color on a bite in
8:45canada won because the dollars better and two because Samantha isn't getting
8:50us so i wanted to use this shade I've actually tried it on camera yet but it's
8:53absolutely beautiful you graduate and shit yourself
8:56she said this like her perfect nude shade and I completely agree with their
8:59it's absolutely stunning
9:01such a beautiful formula consistency I it's not mad at all it's not said it's
9:07nothing more of a cream consistency is very pretty and lightweight feeling but
9:10it's very creamy and hydrating and this is the final look
9:23and that is it for the entire video hope you guys had fun watching this had so

1:52NARS all day luminous talked about this combo like a while back we're going to
1:55like kind of old school and my old school I mean like what like comments I
1:59love the program available combined with no sugar low because my natural finish

2:09talking about the north by itself
2:11I can't do like I think it's too luminous and I don't think it last all

2:53airbrushed of us can tell because until the camera but it looks super super
2:58pretty recent at the foundation is done i'm gonna go in with the make up for

4:24John a little bit more recently i got this like a ultrasound laser on my I
4:29like the fat of my chin like in this area it's an ultrasound that like kind
4:32of attacks the really really pesky fact that you have underneath your chin
4:36basically anywhere they have pesky fat kind of targets that and for me it's
4:40underneath my chin it's like such shit I lost like 15 pounds since I quit

5:05that's what I underneath the eyes a little bit of taking that same me 48
5:08brush and the Kat Von D shade and light using the banana sheet right here going
5:12to hit pan on because it's as a good shade that is some good shit right there
5:17I managed to kind of highlight a little bit underneath that I nothing too crazy
5:20it's not that step is done i'm gonna go and kind of cook the contour and
5:23basically what that means is i'm going to highlight underneath my contour kind
5:27of emphasize the sharp lines of a I'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent
5:30setting powder and a little beauty blender going to be the control
5:34basically wherever I wanted to come
5:35to be sharp like so and then once you wipe that away it's going to be a lot
5:38more clean and sharp and really gorgeous and very Claude toward the close and now
5:42we are nice and how did contour and contoured I mean with contoured i'm
5:45gonna go ahead and take a blush now I got this recently and I died for its the
5:49two-faced little like love flushed hearts palette like that much little
5:53heart makes when it's not so much a little harder than your blushes and I
5:56really want to use one of these and i think what i'm going to use is a mixture
6:00of love hangover and I will always love you and I'm gonna take that one anymore
6:07p53 brush just kind of dip into it and go in i'm gonna go on with all the but a
6:12goodie
6:13we're going to take the makeup ever pull sculpting duo in the shade
6:16number two which is this basically take the gold shade gonna take that shit on
6:19the same brush because this is a nice like flat angled brush and I really want
6:22kinda want to highlight with it to look at that shit for all good the shit is so
6:27I'm just kind of wipe away the cookin themselves as well as I forgot how much
6:30i love it
6:31what I live and breathe for it like so we're going to start the eyes now
6:35already went ahead and did my eyebrows off camera and I prime my eyes already a
6:38scary because I feel like that step is just so not show LA
6:41it's so unnecessary to show you guys cause you guys probably know what I do
6:45because I'm showing you guys so many times and I don't want to bore you
6:47bitches you know I really want to use a new advisor at palate today that when I
6:51hold so I'm gonna be using that today and then I have a couple other
6:54individual shades are going to use it because i really wanted to incorporate a
6:57very bronzy very glittery like had a holiday look so I thought I'm gonna be
7:00doing to day on the ice so first things first I'm gonna take beaches and cream
7:03by making keep which is one of my favorite shades from makeup geek it is
7:06the perfect transition for me for my skin tone if you're lighter than me or
7:09my complexion or a little bit darker it will definitely work for you
7:12I'm taking on a 27 ever to hit pan on it because like twice
7:15it's so so good and I'm just going to go into the crease
7:19I like a lot about the transition shade is that it's not too warm and it's not
7:22too cool
7:22it's literally like a very neutral peachy Shane or another really really
7:26popular shade by makeup geek is peach smoothie
7:29I love that one so much as well but this one it just kind of my go-to if you have
7:32been watching for a while you guys know that beaches and ha is like my shit and
7:38my titties combined court so we have that into the crease but that Marky 27
7:43you guys code more free man you at all caps and store online
7:46boom ten percent off hello that was the fastest fucking affiliate push I've ever
7:50done
7:51I'm gonna fight with Murphy just letting you guys know I'm us he was a member
7:54said oh ok now I'm going with the visor palette i'm so excited to be using this
7:57through i'm gonna take a mixture of these two shades right here it's not
8:01going anymore fee and 433 basically going back to 17 do and that's going to
8:05go into the crease the visor shadows guys are so beautiful or busy right
8:09where the fuck you wanna call it
8:10I'm just gonna kind of go in and start creating my crease with this color all
8:14the way to the front of the eye and then I wasn't getting closer and closer to
8:17being a lot lighter pressure I feel like with the bronze glory look and orange
8:21transition shade will be so beautiful that blend are you joking like that
8:25blend was seamless to have eyes on you fucking bitch and Olivia
8:29so I'm gonna take it is a very warm chocolate brown shade on that same in 43
8:33a little bit less product and that's gonna go into the crease as well we're
8:36going to add so much dimension in this look it's going to be fucking
8:39dimensional ok so I'm going to take that on the outer corner and really start
8:43pushing that into the crease
8:44I'm taking it all the way into the front of the eye as well
8:47a little bit lower than I have at the transition shade that we have down first
8:50and I'm taking and 40 and 50 cent which is a more precise pencil brush is like
8:54very pointed and precise
8:56I'm going to take this gorgeous like deep maroon shade
8:59it's not a bronzy warm tutorial without this color eye color like maroon because
9:03I'm very maroon maroon is that the color of my salt so I'm gonna go in with that
9:07one of us a little bit lower than the other shades not going to go all the way
9:11into the front again just like a deal with the other shades lower than my
9:14other transitions I swear this is going to be like the ultimate transitional
9:17thing
9:19I'm just taking a clean blending brush is a morphy 13
9:25I'm gonna just clean out those edges a little bit clean up those edges
9:28nothing looks too too harsh and then grabbing the Anasazi Beverly Hills fudge
9:33is actually part of our newest collection they just did a new fall
9:36collection on a morphine 36 a very small pencil brush that's going to go into my
9:40crease for some added dimension definition but it's going to take the
9:43darkest of the shades
9:44it's a very dark chocolatey chocolate put that in the crease and fudge is
9:49going to lowest possible into our crease right up to that very very warm
9:53transition that we got going on and I just go halfway in and I'm not going to
9:56take it all the way in like I did the chains
9:58this was just going to go halfway in and see me deepest at the outer corner as i
10:03think i'm going to be doing a winged liner with this little perfect about you
10:05have this fiery warm crease going on right now i'm going to start with the
10:09lid now I grabbed my makeup geek grandstand eyeshadow i think it's such a
10:14beautiful bronzy shade and I think it's gonna be perfect with this look like
10:18actually perfect Anton and Jaffe and for 21 which is a very nice flat packing
10:22brush it kinda reminds me of the mac one and i'm sure those are packing out onto
10:25the lid
10:26it's such a beautiful bronze shade obviously i'm gonna be putting glitter
10:29on top so it's just going to my base color right now to have underneath the
10:34glitter to give it more dimension and now for the fun part i'm going to be
10:37taking v2 faced shadow insurance clicker and mac reflex bronze and glitter and
10:41that's gonna go on top of the lid but I'm gonna take that same brush them for
10:4421 from morphe the Too Faced shadow insurance clear glue is probably my
10:48favorite glitter glue that I've ever ever ever ever tried i think it's so so
10:53good and you guys are looking for a good glue the two this one is sick and then
10:56we're going to kind of pack on some glitter glue taking some of the glitter
11:00just dipping what you can dig my hole brush in it and just pray and just go
11:04ahead and start packing on the lid
11:06I'm obsessed
11:11I love mac reflex glares because they're so finely milled they're not an intense
11:15chunky glitter they're basically like a pigment with a lot of glitter in it and
11:18that's why I love it so much she doesn't see how sickening the reflection is it's
11:21very cool very cool so let's go ahead and finish the other half the camera
11:24back and I'll be right back
11:26so the eyes look like so far also rather like just like a random side know you
11:29guys do not need advise our palate to do this i know that the power is hella
11:32expensive but you don't use this palette to be able to accomplish this but you
11:35can use like the morphe 35o it's very warm just like this you can use some
11:40makeup geek eyeshadows you can use whatever you guys have at your disposal
11:42so just don't do that you need to use the device our palate to be able to
11:45accomplish this look I just got this i wanted to use it because I love you

11:51like the eyes
11:52okay great so I went and I did my liner off of camera I just need both hands and
11:55I need a mirror to be this close to do it us know what I mean like when you do

12:34it doesn't have to be like fucking meter anything like that you just need to line
12:37it taking the same be 36 pencil brush
12:41we're going to start just diving into the colors that we use from the visor
12:44palette all the four up here we're going to start diving in using those colors
12:48we're going to kind of blend out this lower lash line
12:50I'm going to first go in with a really chocolaty shape right here
12:53well maybe you should like blend out the liner first fourth and final eight blend
12:57out of that perversion liner a little bit

0:14hey guys welcome back to my channel so today's video is going to be a one brand
0:19makeup tutorial or what I do the whole face
0:21this one's gonna be next cosmetics I'm thinking about doing a new series on my
0:24channel where I'm doing full-on full-blown full-face tutorials with just
0:27one brand and I think this is the first 1 i'm starting with his next
0:30um I was very very very very very hesitant to create this video I do love
0:34a lot of nice things but I do not love a lot of mixed things as well and this is
0:38the first time trying a lot of things on myself in the tutorial and I'm not the
0:42same person like after you have noticed I'm not the type of person to talk shit
0:46about a brand or talk shit about a product on my channel a lot of people do
0:49that and it's great for a lot of people they like doing that but it's not my
0:52style I don't like talking shit about other brands and like about other
0:55products I like talking great about products and then just not mentioning
0:58products i don't like you know I mean so the fact that i haven't tried to love
1:02the next up I used in this video makes me nervous because it's like okay with
1:05us going to see if I like it or not it's gonna be right there an obvious so i
1:08hope you guys don't mind that we're if you guys can see like I don't like a
1:10product on but I don't need to talk to any brand
1:13yeah if you guys want to see that that have been going sorry it was long and
1:16show but I just I just had to say that because I'm just I'm not used to this
1:19kind of video so let me know what you guys thought if you guys like this kind
1:22of video and then of course i'll continue to do it but I was like am I
1:26going to do this because I want to talk shit but sometimes people need
1:30constructive criticism
1:32you know I'm you guys don't like the video don't fucking watch it don't if
1:38you don't like that shit
1:40yeah ok go to the store and my ok cool so let's go and get the show on the road
1:46we're going to the full face today i'm super-nervous be filming this because i
1:50don't like I don't do this kind of thing like that we'll talk about products I've
1:53never tried before on camera
1:55we're going to do is we're going to go and start with the next angel veil skin
1:58perfecting primer this one this one is one of the ones i have tried and didn't
2:05just put that much
2:07honestly I really do love like this primary like I think it's really pretty
2:11I think would be really nice base and fields next to the skin does it feel to
2:15Silicon e but it definitely feels like it has a slip to it so i think we should
2:19go on to it really nicely
2:20let's just say about it but that's a pretty good product i like that primer
2:23next we're going to the next studio photogenic foundation and she wanted to
2:27soft beige
2:28we're gonna get all of it on the back of my hand foundation is very very very
2:32liquidy like has so much like slip to it and honestly like I tried this
2:36foundation - so far i have really weird mixed feelings about this foundation
2:39because i think that it doesn't give enough coverage to have to use a lot of
2:42product it leaves you with a satin finish and I'm not into satin finishes
2:46for my foundation
2:47I like to make my foundation like Matt and then I make it more on glow in
2:50certain areas that I want to be good
2:52so now i'm going to go ahead and take mine more feet and 4 39 and we're going
2:55to really press the foundation into the skin
2:57I was gonna use a beauty blender with this but the Beauty Blender really it
2:59looks even more like this one
3:01I really want to just press the donation in because i want to keep the medium
3:05coverage this is like a medium coverage foundation and I really want to leave at
3:08least keep the medium coverage
3:09I want more but it's light and my nose is like rejecting this foundation good
3:15like my nose is not having it
3:17we have one layer of foundation on my put a lot of it on but I mean they
3:20believe her down
3:21what do you think next I'm gonna grab the NYX HD concealer in the shade light
3:27and that was going to conceal under is it like that with the concealer
3:33I tried this consider literally only one time before we'll see how my opinion out
3:37what I think about it right now on the forehead as well this is kind of weird
3:44then we go in without marking the same morphe brush and really just press it in
3:48let them see you there
3:50actually no I'm going to go ahead and take the m 4 39 my morphe which is a
3:54smaller kabuki brush and buff out the concealer
3:56I like this considered I think it's a really pretty concealer I do I really do
4:00it gives me a nice medium to full coverage it doesn't settle too terribly
4:04and comes pretty well with the concealer and makes it look like I have much more
4:07full coverage which is
4:08really like not to map not too bad computer I like you
4:12you win me over it's going to be a little bit on the islands as well just a
4:17prime for nationals later not using concealer is primary cell a very light
4:21layer of it because you want to crease is going to the opposite effect if you
4:23put way too much
4:25so we're going to put a very light amount of concealer on the lead
4:30I look like a fucking ghost
4:33so now we're going to go ahead and take the next highlight in control pro
4:37palette i haven't tried this one yet
4:39I guess we'll see what I think we're right now and we're going to use the
4:42banana shade for the under highlighting let's go ahead and load up my more free
4:46and 4 30 a brush
4:47so when i dip into the product i notice that's really powdery so a lot of
4:51product is actually tell but around the around the pan there's a lot of excess
4:55part that lifts up which is kind of annoying but I can do with that
4:58so we're going to go ahead and set
5:01the underground with this and then go and see your eyelids as well i'll have
5:08my life I don't know if I like this a lot honestly so far I'm not feeling it
5:13it's too powdery doughnuts for the bronzer so let's go ahead and take it
5:16like any kind of brush like this like a little paddle brush
5:18we're going to go ahead and dip into this color here so he said this is how I
5:21feel the pygmy is great because it's like there's a lot of pigment that comes
5:24up but it's so ridiculously it's so ridiculously pottery
5:31it's just it's such a mess ok let's go ahead and bronze look I feel like it's
5:36patchy like do not see like there's like patching is here
5:40I'm just going back in with my foundation brush and just kind of
5:42carving out the bottom of it to help with the patchiness much better it's a
5:46little more diffused now at least
5:47but you know where we're going to use everything that we can because this is a
5:50full next two are you gonna do another thing i don't like about this part is
5:55that every single color here gives a satin finish never liked truly mad which
6:00I don't like i wanted i wanted to give me more of a matte finish
6:04especially when i'm going in with more bronzy colors for my contour going to go
6:07ahead and grab this color all the way over here and that's going to be our
6:10like highlight tone color thing really pretty scene when you look at it in here
6:17it looks much more warm than this one is really pale and super like silver this
6:21one of the things that little more warmer but this one looks silver on me
6:24trying to work with that work with that
6:26and now we're going to go in with toe blush by next I hear about this blush
6:30all the freaking time that's like super amazing
6:32so bomb and it gives you a really nice pretty contours are going to try it
6:35right now I have to try to get so we'll see i'm going to use the rounded brush
6:39brush my make a geek like my normal contour brush I use i'm just going to
6:43control with that
6:45it definitely is much more of a cool tone bronzy look I'm not usually doing
6:50cool tone contours which is so finding can click so controversial like I always
6:54do like really warm contour
6:56that's a style i like to do but um you know what I i think this is cute i like
7:00this is a taupe is cute
7:02I can see why people like it for sure ok so we're contoured and ribbons we're
7:05going to go in with Nick's amber blush with him or Fiji eight now we're just
7:10going to put in turn blush area
7:12toss it on I'm sure is pretty
7:16Oh super pigmented why do i do this to myself
7:21okay you know what if we have a lot of blood on its fine we're going to go back
7:23on that foundation brush really just press over it eight plus pigmentation
7:27nyx cosmetics from the blushes
7:30holy titty in my face is coming together now it's looking better looking better
7:34for sure
7:35okay so we're done with the face basically
7:39I think we're good to go these are you gonna go into our brows first stories do
7:42our eyes
7:43I'm gonna go in with the next eyebrow gel waterproof eye brow gel and espresso
7:47and he hopes to express my last month we have tried to browse already
7:50I'm i don't really honestly my opinion on the bridge on their very intense
7:55it's hard to get a small amount and like not look dry clean it but um I think the
7:59colors really nice something like going really smoothly but I wish that they
8:02lasted longer on the brows because they don't last as long as I want to do is
8:05you want to see like a waterproof like I don't think the water looks like they
8:08definitely will come off so your brows you do not normally overturning closer
8:15yeah
8:17and then I'm going to go in with the Knicks attention brown mascara and the
8:21color black
8:22not really black and the brown take a deep brown I have tried this one yet so
8:26we'll see how this goes
8:27please be okay what is it there please be a good product
8:33mm-hmm no sweetheart uh-huh
8:37so not gonna work for me ok so the reason I don't like it because it's kind
8:41of chunky and the way implies it doesn't apply evenly on the Browse like when
8:45you're like if you have a spot on your brother that guys like a lot of hair and
8:48you're going to go over it like the skit and it will apply like a lot towards
8:52like where I have more hair so and then also what kind of moves
8:55that's why I didn't want to be removed and just it feels like wax honestly just
9:01feel like wax it doesn't feel , brow gel should feel like I have dinosaur growls
9:05in those rooms are bomb that this one
9:08don't worry i wanted to like you're really into that but I don't
9:13after trial and carbon this is what the Browns end up looking like i'm trying to
9:18get away from being like more fleet proud I am trying to more like the
9:20natural brown but products i had did not allow me to do natural
9:23I have to go fleek the parts maybe go for a week and had no joining the handle
9:28and now we're doing is we're going to go ahead and go back in with this palette I
9:32know he don't like you very much but we're going to be strong we're gonna use
9:34it so i'm using my shadow
9:36so our windows going to go out this color here which is a basically I'm
9:39cream color and that we're going to toss in to make sure everything kind of blend
9:42into everything a lot easier on a sigma e40 to highlight and contour shades like
9:46they're very pigmented but they're so hot early it just drives me insane i
9:50couldn't use them just based on the fact they're they're going with the morphine
9:55for 3 which is like my favorite movie brushes and then we're going to go ahead
9:58and go in with this shade right here
10:00the 1i used to bronze with that we're going to toss into the crease
10:03we're gonna carve out the decrease with it was like that looks pretty nice
10:09I'm really impressed with as a shadow . patches a shadow but it's catching on
10:13the face
10:14that's like I'm going then we're going with the easy for teams kind of blend
10:18I'm a firm believer in even if you'd like the shadiest shadows of the
10:21shittiest product if you have a good brush everything will turn out okay and
10:25then i'm going in with a Kentucky little flat brush and walking in with that same
10:27cream color we used just kind of highlighting the brow bone with it a
10:31nice pretty bone white color now we're actually going to go in with an
10:34eyeshadow called The Chaser fashion fascination
10:37I don't know what this is I had no idea what it's called not a single clue what
10:40that was going to go and we're going to talk about into the outer corner just
10:42for some extra dimension little bit more of a cool tone brown
10:46how many is that more like a contour Brown who like that country like it I
10:53like that kind of law
10:54I'm really impressed with how these blend on the i am not gonna lie i right
10:58and they're not hard to blend out on
10:59I am NOT faces another story another story in the face but I pretty good how
11:04about those tools that were using now we're going to go in with the girl talk
11:09I shadow the girl talk is actually part of the new prismatic shadows are
11:12launching honestly the prismatic channels are freaking bomb dude like I'm
11:16so impressed by these prismatic shadows
11:19we're going to press it on your eyelid
11:22not that we're going to use our finger press on to the lid
11:25look at that that's nice right up to the crease and then we're going to kind of
11:29go in with that and 43 just going to blend out the edges
11:32let's go into something fun we're going to go ahead and grab makes the studio
11:35liquid liner in stream below which was like this and that we're going to use
11:39our Island
11:44oh my god that was mentioned I battle is my shit
11:51we're just gonna go ahead and go underneath it and just kind of clean it
11:54up with concealer
11:55problem number one with this is that you can see right here is because it's so
11:58liquid that end up going into like a wrinkle in my eye and now it transferred
12:01upwards but for now let's just focus on the liner to get straight as possible
12:06everything would've been so perfect it just did not transfer her
12:09we're going to do is we're going to go to the concealer like it that way I'm
12:13gonna let that dry for a lot of concealer dry and then we're going to go
12:17over with some shadow later
12:18go now that we're dealing with the madness was just loaded crying it's
12:21gonna be fine
12:22it's gonna be fucking upon are you going with the next tray jolie eyeliner and
12:27brown and I think this one is really cute i feel like it's built pretty well
12:29actually in that you have a little twist top and a nice liner
12:32I think it's really pretty and I waterline these payment in like that and
12:37I buff it out
12:37nice warm brown like that you were quickly with this thing is drying fast
12:41and we're going to go in with that same bronzing claro used and then we're going
12:45to buff that over the liner because i don't want to be too dark just want to
12:50be pretty warm and if you can if everything is dry just going to go back
12:54to work on a bus in that concealer
12:58ok so that's what that looks like now that we had a couple hiccups but it's
13:01fine
13:02we dealt with it or strong bitches we can do with this shit
13:05okay well first I real quick off camera I'll be back
13:08so now we're going to apply some mascara we're going to use mix the skinny
13:13mascara which is a new product for them it's like literally like the tiny thing
13:16I've ever seen it and I think it's kind of a badass to let me help
13:19um this message is a Fed nominal Alex separating lashes
13:23I don't think it's really meant for the top to be honest but I don't have any
13:26other next month's care for the top so I'm just gonna make it work make it work
13:31with Tyra says bitch make it work
13:34so perfect for the bottom of my little bit it's a little i'm never going to put
13:39myself in the eye again cause you know I got my scare on the top and the bottom
13:42doesn't matter for the top like I'm just doing it to make it look a little more
13:44black because we're going to go in with policies
13:46anyway so don't even trip we're going to go in with falsies I haven't yet this is
13:50the
13:51mu para number one when i open this . I just I'm like can you even think we need
14:03one time I saw Scott Barnes going on his lashes like higher so I started playing
14:09on my lashes with her hair
14:13yes slashes are so good i want to slap my camera they're so good at that
14:21yeah test finally got the I look out down he finally got that I looked down
14:26so i'm going to be guys in for a final
14:28I look
14:37now that we're done with the eyes we get a move on to my favorite part which is
14:40always the lips you guys know that you're like my go-to thing I love doing
14:44lipstick i love doing

15:08live and then i'm going to go ahead and grab the next soft matte lip cream in
15:11east on board
15:13it's a nice town good no no accident that was on a business the blacks and
15:17abba
15:18I tried to Istanbul I was that is not so good like cake batter something about
15:25just such a pretty color oh my gosh
15:28they smell amazing they apply amazing but definitely not that mad like a cream
15:33that creme lipstick formula i don't really see them as being any kind of
15:36mattifying may be able to drive my lips never tried this before so see you
15:40getting mad at me now and I do you like it yeah and that was it for the final
15:44look hopefully you liked it
15:46I think this is really cool i think it's fun to kind of test out a whole entire
15:49brand to do a full face could be like resourceful you have to use a browser as
15:53eyeshadow or something that you have to be resourceful and I think it's fine i
15:56know i don't really like everything that i use but i think that the final product
15:59came out pretty nicely I think you can do is going to look for a lot less money
16:02than looks like done in the past so I think that's really really really really
16:05cool let me know if you guys really want this to be serious - I can do it with a
16:08couple more brands i think that would be so fun to do like a series like a

1:38that I'm really really really excited to go to me to Khandala see clearly in like
1:42two weeks like it's so freakin fast and random but just like this pattern some
1:46back and let's go to tell you guys I'm so excited to see this
1:50yeah okay just tutorial site hey guys ok so basically starting with our base
1:55completely done already i have like my contour on my head like going
1:59I was bronzed she's bronze and ready to go I'm i do not remember exactly what i
2:04did for the tutorial like I remember exactly close i use but basically
2:08grabbed a bunch of clothes i think i use
2:10so we're going to try to still do it wish me luck first we're going to do is
2:13going to go ahead and take beaches and cream
2:15i'm a geek which is this color here and that's gonna be our transition shade on
2:18an e 40 we're going to go and just toss that into our crease
2:21the reason I'm having it down first because i want to have a color down to
2:24be able to blend all my other colors into first but it's already primed by
2:28the way that's what I fear may be shadows of all time
2:30I still need to make a favor make a big shadow video
2:34so let me just don't want that we're going to mix bitten by makeup geek and
2:38cocoa bear by making because we're to make them together we're going to toss
2:41that into our outer corner on a more feet and 4 33 which is especially is
2:45very often it's very so much of mac 217
2:48I'm just going to us on the outer corner very likely very softly the maybe
2:51shadows are so freaking pigmented like you guys know maybe because my favorite
2:55brand of all life
2:57we're also going to toss it into our inner corner as well
3:01right into the crease so let's look at the close down in the outer and inner
3:07corner I we're going to do is we're going to make a halo that brush with no
3:10additional color
3:11I was going to very lightly etch out where a crease it is very light motion
3:16like that
3:18so you can see how this nice little ring around my eye and we're going to the
3:22center completely open cup for shimmery colors gonna go
3:24I was leaving that right here and i'll just go back in with that same be 40 x
3:28sigma and i'm just going to blend the edges
3:31this is why i was so crucial to have that beaches and cream color down first
3:34so we can have a base that the colors blend into nicely
3:37see how nicely that's running out just because we have that base down it makes
3:41such a huge difference to me now that we have that nice warm halo we look going
3:45down now i'm actually going to go ahead and grab a starter Beverly Hills beauty
3:49mark shadow which is basically a very very very deep dark plum put it right
3:53between the Barone and the inner corner so we're going to write here this is
3:59going to give us the definition in the death or it's gonna like a feather it
4:02and that we're doing that on a like a little pencil brush like that
4:05you got a little bar on jets the outer corner as well so they don't go back in
4:11with that same and for 33 and just kind of blend out the edges again
4:15no additional part i'm just letting it blend out very softly
4:22it looks something like this
4:26it's a nice dark hey Louie effect this is optional but I'm gonna just go back
4:30in with a little bit of black from making big it's called correct at a very
4:34tiny amount in the innermost corner just for that little bit of extra depth and
4:38dimension
4:39this part is optional you definitely don't need to do this but I figured what
4:42the fuck why not you know
4:44this book is very pigmented so you don't need a lot of trust me making like a
4:47little outer V now we're going to go in with a clean brush
4:52it's a morpheme 441 it's just a clean fluffy brush and that was going to kind
4:57of blend the whole thing that brushes clean so I just really wanted to have it
5:01there from blending purposes only not for depositing color and now we'll go
5:06back in with the e-40 and just blend out those edges even more with no additional
5:11product at all is well this looks so easy but I swear it's so freaking easy
5:16sorry I'm funny how easy this shit is but it looks a little bit intimidating
5:19when you first like see it but honestly you know you have the tools to get the
5:22colors
5:23you're good to go and of course i have a code with morphe brushes it's manny
5:26anyway in all caps and you get ten percent off i mean it's a little it's a
5:29little co2 little Commission code
5:31you guys don't need to use that code if you guys wanted the morphe brushes
5:33already so cost efficient or not like expensive at all so if you don't want to
5:37say no 10-percent then go right ahead and use it and in fact it's all good but
5:41it's one league has no got the option is there
5:43cool so now we're going to do is we're gonna go ahead and grab a flat brush
5:47I'm gonna use the exact blend you 32 x sigma and then I'm gonna grab makeup
5:51geek shimma shimma which is like a very shimmery champagne tone and now we're
5:56going to talk to Lynn
5:59right into the center and so what's gonna bring a lot of focus of the eye
6:02and then I'll go in with that same morphe brush that in 43 and just kind of
6:05blend out those edges a little bit with no additional product
6:10yeah yeah ok so i went ahead and grabbed an eyeliner I'm describing the one by
6:16the bomb
6:17it's the mr. right now Dean eyeliner pencil everything that they do is so
6:21cute i was going to run out of the water line as well as underneath the lash line
6:28very lightly
6:30I'm going to blend it out
6:34we're going to go ahead and grab the same bin and coke shadow on the little
6:39pencil brush and we're going to run over that black with the shadows
6:45and then we're going to blend out those even more places that pay for that I let
6:55go and finish that I real quick and I'll be right back okay cool
6:59no you're both eyes done is what they look like both eyes done real now
7:03clock me you can't I know I can't clock this bitch I'm gonna use the Too Faced
7:11better than sex mascara all day but good
7:14oh my god . click on my care of me it is the clock and I need to be a dinner at
7:20eight and i still want me to help me please
7:25oh I love this mascara forgot how much i really liked it really gives you volume
7:28and extension cable network for the bottom line we're going to use the next
7:31skinny mascara which is killing 21 and I think it's literally perfect for the
7:35bottom lashes those of you who are looking forward to booking my high again
7:40bitch think
7:42oh good so I'm going to go in with some falsies of course the falls i was
7:46wearing in that video where the believe you
7:49parent number two which give a really pretty like lifted flare especially in
7:54the center
7:54I think it's going to be great for this look because we already have a lot of
7:57focus towards the center of the lid to make it look a little bit more round and
8:00pretty
8:01seems like she's just really give you so much extension because they lift up
8:04naturally blinking view lashes honestly you guys like they are the best mean
8:08clashes I never used and I tried a lot I've been sent a lot of new clashes and
8:13blinking is definitely definitely definitely my favorite and I don't know
8:16what it is like their styles are a little bit different than other pairs
8:19their band is super super super comfortable and they just they just last
8:22a long time already used it sparingly 10 times they look as if I just barely open
8:26them but they look amazing i love them and I have a code is blinking um g10 and
8:31you say ten percent I mean it's cool if you don't use it you don't have to do
8:34anything that but it's an option there if you want to save some money on me
8:37I mean parents usually 35 bucks that mean clashes because they last a long
8:41time but these ones are 30 and then you get to save on the three bucks if you
8:45use a code so you get for 27 but I've never I've never seen in clashes sold
8:49for $27 ever ever ever ever
8:52I know the best one I've ever used so we commute
8:56you guys are so good to me honestly you guys like slay me

1:24okay who's ready for this is mario oh I've built in so long i'm fucking where
1:28you're going home where I'm going to go so much going to start this tutorial
1:33with the face already done at my base on i use the Born This Way Foundation you
1:38want they just launched by to face i am trying for the first time right now on
1:41my face nothing looks really really nice and the reason i decided to my face
1:46already is because this tutorial is more on the like intricate side like this
1:49more steps to doing this look then it looks but i'm going to go ahead and just
1:54have my face are you done
1:55don't give me no lip so let's go and start this Beach
1:58ok cool so first things first I'm going to start in with peaches and cream and
2:02Peach Smoothie by makeup geek I'm going to mix those on my brush because i kind
2:06of want to be a little more warm than usual and i'm having a little bit of
2:09peach smoothie because i usually go to my beaches and communities no beaches
2:11and cream isn't my favorite transition shade of all time but I wanted to be
2:15slightly more warm than usual so that's why I'm having the Peach Smoothie into
2:19it
2:19oh and i'm already primed on the lids and my browser kind of filled in with
2:23some brow gel so forget it was wondering like this it's really going in with
2:28nothing no
2:29I'm already primed with this e27 this is like my favorite i'm blending brush
2:33right now it's a very similar similar to the e 40 x sigma and Matthew 24 just a
2:37really great fluffy blending brush which looks something like this it's just easy
2:41transition very very low-key can invade be honest i'm going to take a more feet
2:47and 4 33 which is very similar due to the mac 217 and i'm going to mix cocoa
2:50bear i'm a geek with secretive my morphe i just discovered the shadow recently
2:55I've actually using the tutorial but it looks so effing pretty I had literally
2:59like a to use it sometimes it on the outer corner and i'm mixing the two
3:03Colbert and secretive secret is a very very very warm deep maroon color it's so
3:08nice it's so freakin nice
3:10I've never even like going any of the morphe single shadows i got them when I
3:13was a famous bow so I was like Hello what the hell I'm doing not only getting
3:17the single shot with Murphy
3:18okay so I'm gonna go and take that and for 33 and those two colors and put it
3:22into my crease a little bit lower than I thought the transition colors right up
3:25into the inner corner because this is more of a smoky eye
3:27i'm having my eyes open for this so i can see exactly where the shadow will be
3:31when my eyes are open the secret of shadow you're making a lot of bitten but
3:34it is more red than Britain's not have to travel down there just place down
3:38there's no blending going on that you 27 really just blend out the shadows in to
3:43the transitions that we had down first
3:46this is gonna really help keep everything a lot more blended and a lot
3:49more diffuse this is why i have the shadows down first and it's going
3:52circular motions without you 27
3:54I love this blending brush to death you are using extremely extremely warm tones
4:00so that you're gonna have to continue to blend blend blend and just when you
4:03think that you're done blending blending a little bit more than you're good
4:05it's where it should look something like this nice and blended out very warm
4:09cranberry Brown i get your noises my converse you're fucking-a now I'm gonna
4:15go in with that same for 3 with a white a little bit off on my pants and I'm
4:20gonna go in without especially health beauty mark shadow is one my favorite
4:23rappers of all time
4:24it's a beautiful warm plummeting a plum brown it's so fucking pretty I use it
4:29all the time you guys don't use the whole time I'm going to concentrate on
4:32the outer corner because this is going to be more of a smoky look and there's
4:35kind of blending it forward into the crease ok now that you have this bad boy
4:39blend it out nice little
4:40warm intense crease going on right now pretty smoky we're going to grab the
4:44two-faced glitter glue it looks like this i saw Jacqueline using this and so
4:49obviously i was like what Jackson illusion that and we're gonna put that
4:54all over the lid i'm going to go ahead and use any synthetic brush i'm gonna
4:57use the more feet 320 i'm in love with the whole lid all the way up to the
5:01crease and then now for the star of the show that everyone was asking me to talk
5:05about it is boom boom shadow by Mac that's a dazzle shadow is one of the
5:08newest shades it's one of the most beautiful shots never even come across
5:12ever and I'm going to cut my finger
5:14I'm gonna put that onto the lid and press it on my god i love using this
5:19with a glitter glue down first because it really makes the shadow pop
5:24underneath it as well as it's going to stay there all freakin day just many
5:28ways to an event and that bitch stayed on now to take that and 43 and just come
5:32and go in to the crease with a slightly blend out any hard lines usually when
5:37using glitter glue and glitter like there will be hard lines just a little
5:41baby amount of blending bull really hope this is what the top of the list look
5:45like i'm gonna go ahead and finish the other I off-camera when we come back
5:49we'll do the bottom of the eyes and we'll be doing ok ok ok so i have both
5:53of the eyes done on the top even don't even if it doesn't huggles you like the
6:00life but like the cuter version called goggles
6:02ok ok since the tops of eyes are done it's going to focus on the bottom now
6:06we're going to go and take peach smoothie on my morphe be 36 my favorite
6:10pencil brush of all time you guys already know by now that it's like my
6:14obsession a bitch can't stop a bitch canceled for reals i'm gonna take my
6:18secretive and colbert mix again on the same brush and then put that starting on
6:23the outer corner and then i'm going to work it forward work a good link down
6:28and then we're going to take my morphe and 50 k which is a really tiny be
6:32lining brush and take that beauty mark shadow again and put that clothes to the
6:37lashline can really speak when I do this to really help darken the outer corner

0:40feel like this is a very pretty appropriate kind of prom

1:32watching this shadow to you for texting me that we have the same exact i looked
1:36on and also same side let's get to the tutorial this problem beautiful problem
1:41by you guys will talk to you soon
1:43let's go ahead and start this bad boy with a clean face I just showered wash
1:47my face and my stride
1:48so she's clean for now I said we're gonna go ahead and go in with the make
1:53up for ever step 1
1:55equalizers I've been loving these bitches lately so we're going to do that
2:00would actually go in with 2 i'm going to use the base mattifying for the t-zone
2:04the reason I'm using for the t-zone specifically and not like everyone faces
2:06because this bitch when it says mattifying my hi guys i mean funny like
2:11this thing dry my skin areas that I needed to be dry like it was disgusting
2:17the crazy so I'm just going to put it in the t-zone and the areas i usually get
2:20oily
2:21ok I swear like as soon as they put it on me even now by moisture like it's not
2:26that I'm gonna go in with a step one base smoothing all over the rest of my
2:30face
2:31this because I do want to have primer on throughout the rest of my face and this
2:33one is really great for kind of texture and things like that so for foundation
2:37or what I'm going to go in with the estee lauder double wear this is like my
2:40tried-and-true foundation this one drives with that finishes stays on my
2:43face all day getting a full coverage
2:45I love this foundation I've changed 1w to sand and i'm going to use it with a
2:49damp beauty blender with five people were here last night
2:51huge now we're going with our time to dinner and its really press the
2:55foundation in all over the face
2:58there we go nice and full coverage to help me your full color child
3:02i'm going to go ahead and grab the mac pro longwear concealer and nw20 in order
3:06to put that on the under eye areas as well as a brand new who do you like my
3:10which commandment and i love this concealer
3:13it's beautiful bowl not only is it going to highlight me it's going to really
3:16help cover the darkness I have underneath my eye is not that I have a
3:19shade time I'm not much you don't like darkness but she does have some song
3:24I'm gonna use that beauty blender to really help blend it out more i look
3:27like a little girl
3:28that's fine and all come together to get off and now we're going to go in with
3:33the Smashbox comparing things but i did my haul video I a lot of people were
3:37like oh my god you have to use the contour sticks in that video so i was
3:39like your model thing i'm going to do it for anyone use the highlighting one for
3:43the under eye area
3:44the shooting thing about the highlight one is that I feel like it isn't having
3:46me enough
3:47I just don't feel like that's a lot of highly you know but you know it's still
3:50beautiful and still highlights
3:51it doesn't have as much as I wish it didn't but that on the forehead is about
3:54t-zone and then we're gonna put that out the be better as well at the end
3:57these conferences are sol blendable it's not even funny knee
4:02oh my gosh they are still vulnerable makes me sick ok now we're going to go
4:05in with the bronze color stick
4:07the reason I'm putting a base down first because you know we're going to probably
4:10want to stay on as long as you possibly can at least I do I know I do
4:14and so I think have
4:15the base down first will really help the longevity of which i'm gonna take the
4:19Beauty Blender and buff that and like they're blending out phone easily and
4:24it's making me and it felt good
4:26tell me that it's not gorgeous okay cause this is what it looks like with
4:31just the bronze stick on i think i look super pretty much time to look at more
4:34bronze and kind of glowing in getting us to mention when I look like such a ghost
4:38and now we're going to go in with the contour stick and this one we're going
4:41to be a little bit more precise with a stick and we're going to do right by the
4:44top of the ear and that's all we're gonna do is we're going to blend it out
4:47i don't want to be too hard with this one because ones as much more of a great
4:50toe into it and the bronze g one does the lighter with this one I think the
4:53better and i'm going to go ahead and use my g3 from morphe to really just gonna
4:56help blend that in i'm going to go with that beauty blender just kind of press
5:01over it just to give us a little diffusion got off the views to the same
5:05thing for him
5:06I'm going to take the laura mercier he's setting powder okay seriously
5:09this powder and a double life it really fucking is do it's so good and get me a
5:15map throughout the day
5:16i'm making a beautiful like airbrush finish i just love it so we're just
5:19going to go in really just pressing on the power over our faces underneath that
5:23I - can I don't forget that because he will create the creasing monster
5:28and don't forget your lids to because we did use the concealer as our base and
5:32now we describe a big fluffy brush just dust away and the actual card that might
5:37be there
5:37I'm going to finish are faced with the Kat Von D shade and light palette
5:42because i love this bad boy
5:44so much going to grab the highlight middle shade right here on a more fee
5:48and 438 like my kinda late rush of life and it's gonna really just press that in
5:53on top of the highlighted areas where we put the Smashbox contour stick the
5:58t-zone as well and then go for shits and giggles let's go ahead and put in mac
6:03emphasize highlighting sculpting powder just a little bit just to brighten it
6:07even more
6:08we really don't need to step but you know i'm a big ass directly not hard
6:12dimension hey I feel like I have to be quiet because people are like in my
6:15house like those like workers and shit and I'm like I'm not gonna be quiet
6:19I don't care where he continued with the shade light power we're gonna grab
6:21subconscious with the makeup geek rounded brush brush I use this brush all
6:25the time for contouring I just feel like it's perfect its precise it's easy
6:28towards the back of our ear and just use that as our contouring shade and just
6:32kind of buff it in
6:33we're not doing anything too precise this is just really going to ensure that
6:36we have it on a lot longer . the night or I mean we're going to probably going
6:39to say it's like I'm not about to be on down on the dance floor and my contours
6:42melting off like be her last time
6:45not me and cup those cheekbones your wish
6:50so we have our contour and highlight time we're going with some blush i'm
6:53going to take a makeup geeks
6:55where are you i think it's spelled out because it's literally huh
6:58spell about makeup geek blush which is the perfect PT pink I think it's so
7:03beautiful and we're gonna grab that on a morphine and 500 which is a big fluffy
7:07brush i wanna go to handle the blush so that's why I'm grabbing a big fluffy
7:09brush like this it's so pretty
7:11ok let's go on and they're going to go ahead and highlight we're going to use

7:19- this is seriously so beautiful like I think I really died
7:25we're going to describe the highlight shade on the bronze shade I feel like
7:28it's a little bit just to warm for me it's a little bit too orange and
7:31something wrong i love warm bronze and I love warm like contouring college I
7:35really do but I mean I can only go so far

8:14ok so I'm going to do my brows off camera I feel like it takes a little
8:16while I can definitely do a brow routine video if you guys are interested in that
8:19but I'm just gonna do it off camera clicks I felt just going to be some time
8:21to be right back
8:23cool so we have the browse on I don't know why I've been feeling like I want
8:26to go more fleek lately I just feel like a strong i just feel like doing strong
8:30browse right now I don't know what it is
8:32I just do it because i do this and using bitches to fuck me when I do this you
8:39know we get to let our eyes so I'm gonna try my very best to recreate this look I
8:45do not remember exactly every single that used by grab colors i think i'm
8:49pretty sure i used so this is what I have had so please wish me luck on this
8:54i know you guys do because you guys want it
8:56I think I go ahead and zoom you guys in because I really want you guys to really
8:59focus on the eyes because this sighs look is a little bit more
9:02it's not hard to do but there's some steps there's a couple steps to it so I
9:06figure it'd be a lot easier for me to see you guys in
9:08first we're gonna go ahead and start with peaches and cream by making you
9:11guys know what my favorite transition shade of all time and I'm gonna take
9:14that on a Sigma e-40 blending brush and we're just toss that into the crease is
9:18our tradition so you don't need me to meet with it
9:20I just got a new signal 40 so I'm just like new and then I'm going to go ahead
9:24and actually take a sigma e55 which is a flat shader brush my morphe brushes are
9:30dirty you guys I'm sorry forgive me but they're all talking right now
9:33I mean I'm taking the Anasazi bling eyeshadow and i'm going to put that on
9:36my brow bone as my highlight already have like some concealer down there that
9:39I used to clean up my brow so we're just gonna really help set that ish in motion
9:45what am I saying
9:46idea and then we're gonna actually go in with Poppy by a good because well I were
9:50to take a very small amount of it and now we're going to talk into the crease
9:52with that same here 40
9:54this is really gonna give us that warm you should have something like this it's
9:56nice warm transition shade
9:59we're gonna go in with mocha on a morphine and 43 and clean this point in
10:03time
10:03mocha by makeup geek and now we're going to kind of focus on the outer corner
10:07press into the outer corner to the crease a little bit
10:11we're really going to run into the crease about half way things are I am
10:14going with the e 40 and just blend that way
10:16it's really crucial to go in with the steps and just continue to blend with an
10:19e 40 or any kind of big fluffy brush
10:22I think it's really really really important that's what I'm doing kind of
10:25blend in transition now i'm going to go in with that same and 43 with make a
10:29geek corrupt so very tiny amount of it because it's very people to donate a lot
10:32and never to that concentrate on the outer corner and slightly bringing it up
10:36words into that papi
10:38not nearly as far as muckle though the same thing going without me 40 and blend
10:42out the black triangle with an e30 pencil brush by Sigma because i really
10:45want to really concentrate the Blackland like a CEO job like you can pay to blame
10:52there we go now we're going with the fun part of the lid color going to go in
10:56with a flat dense packing brush I'm going to use the sigma f 70 which is a
11:01dense packing brush I'm going with make a deep grand span and eyeshadow
11:05this color is literally life like actually literally life or really just
11:11pressing that on right up to the transition shades in my crease that shit
11:16real bright so actually I'm gonna go on my finger and take grandstand I finger
11:19and press that onto the lid
11:21I really wanted to be shine even more shiny the shadows are really great with
11:25your fingers because they give you this nice foil intensity like that then I
11:31want to take a more fee
11:33326 and in the spotlight I make a geek
11:36now we're going to place on our inner corner as our highlight this shit
11:39highlights that motherfucker
11:40and so is what the top of the looks like they look so pretty oh my god
11:45yes other probably yeah
11:48Corner I'm gonna take mocha and mix it in with peaches and cream and we're
11:53going to take a more feet and 5 08 very tiny amazing brush getting underneath
11:57the lash line and they went on that a little bit and then we're going to grab
12:02mr. right now Dean pencil by the bomb which I've used before my channel

0:16with what the deep plum red lip and say hey I wanted to go with this goes a
0:21little like live like you know that's what I can always do a tutorial using
0:25that lip as well he's going to see but this is that I look ahead in it and i
0:28wanted to show you guys how I did it because so many people requested me to
0:31do it so this is the look and so without further ado let's go into YouTube
0:35tutorial become i feel and i think my interests are so fucking long and I just
0:40want to get guys to that
0:50so let's start the shenanigans
0:54let us please so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna start off with some
0:57tape
0:57to be honest I'm not the biggest fan of using tape and makeup in general there's
1:01only two things that you before i use it for smoked outliner like this and i use
1:05it for glitter and we're getting the piece nothing too crazy and they're
1:09going to cut it in half so one piece goes on each eye and the reason I'm
1:12putting in habits so that I don't get so much like my foundation like ripped off
1:16because I foundation already
1:18usually you want to do this makeup before you make a point but I'm stupid
1:22that's what i'm doing is i'm sticking the two pieces that take on the back of
1:26my hand
1:27so we can take off the first layer of like stickiness
1:30it doesn't rip off our I when you're placing the tape
1:33what you want to do we're gonna grab the tape with both hands are going to line
1:36it right underneath
1:37be very careful with this please go right underneath the lashes at the
1:42corner of my eye you see that right there
1:44the reason we're going underneath our lashes because because we don't rip off
1:47our actual election
1:48please so now you have this nice straight line from the bottom lash line
1:54going all the way to your brow game which will stick that there and the part
1:58honestly this part does not not to be stuck
2:00this part is not to be stuck the part that really matters is this part right
2:03here this really needs to be against the skin so you can have that sharp crisp
2:06wine
2:07ok so first things first we're going to go in with our transition shape just how
2:10we go in with transitions were doing normal i look we're going with the
2:13transition for this as well for me i'm going to be going into it make a geek
2:17peaches and Kareem of gonna go with my green room and the luck see Beauty 207
2:22brush which came in the genes makeup brush collection which is really is
2:27beautiful Gina did a great job with her brush collection i think they're
2:29absolutely amazing
2:30we're going to do is literally you're going to go with the beaches color and
2:33is already primed by the way shit is print gonna go in and we're going to
2:37really just feather that forward into the eye from our crease all the way in
2:42to about halfway through our eye on the lid to have the whole I want you want to
2:46have covered with the transition all the way out to the tape this brush is
2:48perfect because it's so fluffy it's not to attend it actually it's an angled
2:53brush on you can tell but its angle - it's really great diffusing from the top
2:56and much more dense towards the base
2:58boom to have a transition color down first and then we're going to transition
3:02again we're going to be using a massage early Hills color and fun
3:053 i'm using this color fun is because I wanted to be a very neutral look I don't
3:09want to be too what I don't want to be too cool
3:11and now we're gonna grab 10 more feet and 4 33 which is I've talked about this
3:14many times
3:15one of my favorite brushes and then we're going to take just a little bit
3:17lower
3:19closing are again taking on the lower - all shadows are so amazing so soft soap
3:26into it and this one we're going to just take about half way down the eye and
3:30into the crease as well and outwards and we're just putting on that a little bit
3:35lower than that beaches color and then i'll just go back in with that original
3:39Russian you want it that looks brush just kind of blend everything together
3:43i'm a freak about transitions I need them to be completely completely
3:47effortless I do not like seeing any hard lines at all it's one of the biggest
3:51piece so I really like having some very diffused easy transition to apply a
3:55little bit more fun
3:56towards the base like that
3:59so she looks something like this so when you're looking down the most pigment on
4:04the outer corner and it transitions outwards from here about two huge can
4:08see that feeding into lightness
4:10now we're going to go in with making be corrupt shadow which is probably the
4:12black as I have ever ever ever use its five dollars like are you kidding
4:17it's so amazing and we're also going to go in with a pencil brush from you
4:20because well it's actually one of the best brushes for tight lining and for
4:24detailed work that I've ever used and make a history ever so we're going with
4:28that which is a little bit of brush you don't need a lot correct because the
4:31corruption was extremely extremely extremely pigmented so just pick up a
4:35little on the brush and now we're going to go even lower than fun
4:38now we're going to run by our lashes about half way and pick up a little bit
4:44more product if you need somewhere and that we're going to run along the tape
4:48about where natural crease is about it go
4:51so we're going to go up to right there
4:53going to kind of bring it down here as well we want to be extremely extremely
4:57black by the lash line
4:58so really just packing it on my last night and the lighter pressure going
5:02upward nothing that blacked out i'm going to go in with another clean
5:05blending brush I don't want to have any other product on it and with the makeup
5:08geek Bible underbrush which looks like this it's a little angled brush and now
5:12we're really going to just bust in that black with the into the fun
5:15you don't need me - this just blend your little heart away because you have to
5:20take their kind of foolproof this way
5:22now we're just kind of taking it out words it's just one of those looks at
5:25its kind of laborious because you have a kind of a lot of steps to do this but
5:28honestly like the finished product is so worth it
5:30look see how fast that was blended out like this is why it's so extremely
5:34crucial to have those transition colors down first because it makes everything
5:37so much faster and everything much more smooth and so now we have let it out i'm
5:41going to go back in with a little bit more correct
5:42we really really really really want to be dark as possible
5:46look something like this so you can see some eyeliner is very diffused and very
5:51blended i just noticed that i took it farther than i wanted to take it the
5:54black I wanted to go about halfway not really necessarily like three fourths of
5:58the way so i'm actually gonna fix that a little bit so what I decided to do is I
6:01decided to grab a big shading kind of brush and I grabbed my mistake
6:06color so for example if I want to kind of a race a shadow or kind of diffuse it
6:09out even more
6:10I would color that night like to call it like my race color and for me it's
6:13vanilla bean
6:14I make a gate when I mean by race I basically means i'm gonna load up this
6:18vanilla bean color I'm going to pack it onto the lid very lightly and blend it
6:24outwards in to the shadows and as you can see right there
6:28it's trying to diffuse out even more and that's kind of what I wanted to happen
6:31I didn't want my black to be so far in so i'll grab this vanilla bean and i'll
6:35take it and run it over the black to give it a nice lighter diffused look see
6:40that now gently not gone it's not a race like home saying but it's definitely a
6:45lot less pigmented a lot less intense and then I'm just gonna go back in
6:49without black not just vanilla bean on my brow bone as well isn't this nice
6:53bone white shadow it's not too intense
6:55it's a little slight slight slight sheen to it it's nothing too heavy at all
6:59and those are my kind of happened
7:00cuz i'm not really the biggest fan of those intense brown highlights a lot of
7:04people are they love them at the bottom is not one of those people
7:07so now that we have everything diffuse and blend it I'm gonna take off the team
7:09carefully to get me this wing out shadow liner and the cool thing about liner
7:17like this is that if you are like me and you have like a hood here that wants to
7:21fall on your lid wasn't going to transfer at all because it's a shadow
7:24it's not an actual liner so you get a nice definition on the outer corner of
7:27the eye but it's not gonna transfer you
7:30and this is why I don't like doing that tape methods because it removes my
7:33foundation and concealer
7:35so what we can do to fix that grab any concealer brush like the consumer brush
7:39that you used earlier like today and I'll grab it and I'm just gonna run it
7:42over that spot with the tape to kind of just diffuse out fact that there was a
7:47hard line there
7:48this will just help me really buff it out this is the morphe m35 one of my
7:53favorite concealer brushes of all time I talked about this in my December
7:57favorites video it's absolutely amazing and it's a while do is just kind of buff
8:01out the line and look see
8:02not nearly as intense and that's crazy as it was before ok so I'm going to go
8:05outside real quick and i will be right back my little darling
8:09ok so now we have the tops of both sides done
8:13they look like this honestly they're not completely 100000% symmetrical but it
8:19honestly does not matter that much to really to be honest like as long as you
8:22get it symmetrical as you possibly can
8:24no one can fault you for trying this is even as I'm gonna get for right now
8:28yeah so just don't don't fret if you guys don't get it completely even for
8:31the first time it's one of those things that just takes a learning curve
8:33especially be doing it for the first time so don't give up on it because I
8:36need you guys to do it you fucking give up on me
8:39take care so now we're doing the bottom lash line
8:44we're not going to do really much the bottom much like that off when I do a
8:46liner like this I like to keep my bottom lash line is clean and clear as possible
8:51ok Richard's gonna come here to me they are going to grab that same making Gibby
8:55brush and whatever we have left on this brush we're just gonna run it on the
8:59lower lash line barely like barely fucking just the outer corner only do a
9:07little somethin somethin right there
9:08not too much though I'll take that about a thirty percent in how meaning that
9:12they're just gonna blend that I really just don't want anything too hard shell
9:17here and i'll just buff it out with whatever we have left on that more of
9:21you brush the m4 33
9:23look something like this it's not too intense on the outer corner but you have
9:26a little bit of definition and I want to keep the definition solely on the outer
9:29corners that's we really just want to keep it on the outer side right now
9:33ok so it's gonna put a quick coat of mascara on this is the Too Faced better
9:36than sex better the thing sign the thing
9:42my lashes are so ugly inside of money
9:46put a little on the bottom to carefully
9:50who's texting me you know what that's enough
9:54I'm consider myself lucky right now with them out i have on so much
10:00so now we're going to go in with lashes we're going to go in with the blinking
10:02you
10:03number four which are these because we're really focusing all the attention
10:07on the outer corner
10:08we're going in with these glasses because they flare out at the end of you
10:11guys can tell a flare
10:13I get so much about you taking out things for a quick little coat of duo
10:19like to have any not too heavily
10:23but that's why I watched into the woods tonight with my friends and i am like so
10:28in musical motor i know it's I'm so much and like plane home
10:31I just wanted like to bust out and sing and dance and the game you know

1:17I'm going with the new foundation today I'm gonna be taking it the cogiendo high

1:25one two three
1:26shit I have thank you so much how to coach you know for sending this to me
1:29they sent me this foundation and they sent me this color
1:32soho let's hope and pray that it's the right color
1:36I'm going to take it out on a morphine for 39 of course whenever having more
1:39voluminous aqua foundation i like to go into more of a dense brush because it
1:43won't soak up as much product as a Beauty Blender will
1:46nice color matching skills guys nice color managing the color is actually
1:50very accurate my face it just lighter than what i like to do you guys know mom
1:54wants to beat earnest but this is a beautiful finish like beautiful and it's
1:59very building was you can see it does build up very very nicely it's not as
2:02full coverage they want but i'm going to wait for full coverage of today like
2:05more of a natural look so I like it I want to go pretty lightweight with the
2:09consumer will be taking the urban decay naked skin concealer gorgeous concealer
2:13i love this one
2:14it's full coverage it's lightweight honestly I don't really have any qualms
2:19with this concealer and I never have so I really went for a really nice fresh
2:22look today
2:23not super crazy not to pretend super drag like I like to do you usually just
2:27a little more brightness I'm gonna have this the dandelion shy beam by then if
2:31it just a little bit just to add some more brightness
2:34I'm just going to put that in just the right in and awake in the look
2:38oh go ahead and set the concealer and taking the laura mercier translucent and
2:41just lightly going over be concealed and brightened areas just going to want to
2:45increase its happening
2:47my interface we're gonna take the naked skin Urban Decay ultra definitions
2:52powder every time they say that that is do much for me and soon as likely set
2:56the entire face with this
2:58this is a nice HD powder it's not as heavy as laura mercier one but it is a
3:01beautiful setting powder to set the face and it is an HD finish so it's going to
3:05be you too full and it's not going to be too heavy
3:08it's gonna be just enough taking some mac studio fix powder and take that neck
3:12just to match up the face a little bit
3:14you guys don't want to be two tone I mean I like to leave the dual chrome to
3:17the shadows . to the face
3:19come on let's match up here ok now taking some trustee hoola bronzer you
3:23guys already know I went through this phase right now where it's like only
3:27hoola bronzer and markets bronzer I like I'm not use any other brothers besides
3:31those because I just fell in love with
3:33I'm just gonna brought up the temples a little bit who is such a pretty color
3:37it's like such a natural bronzer
3:39it really does look like your likes uncased rather than being so like orange
3:42or gray
3:43it's just like such a good neutral color I love this problem where I always have
3:47not fucking spot on my face that doesn't take pic map
3:50I tried like blow a bubble to make it get in there and it just doesn't work
3:55doesn't fucking work
3:57let's do a bit of no snatching it's real quick i'm going to take the morphe 28
4:01and the makeup geek
4:03cool porcelain contour powder and we start contouring the nose slightly just
4:08to give me a nice skin to know to put on too much more rounds around the nose and
4:13now it looks like i just snorted shit to concentrate for the nose contouring you
4:18can go south so quick
4:19we're going to cook the roast to make it look decent because i feel i'm looking a
4:23little cracky okay to kill our mercier translucent setting powder on a more
4:27feet and 45 heat cook the side of the nose to make it look sharper going to
4:31let that rest for a moment and just cook into the nose and i'm still on the
4:35bottom of the browser as well just a very tiny amount because i don't want to
4:39be to confer today I'm going to more of a natural i mean naturally you're going
4:42to get for me i'm going to go into my e49 brush my morphe just a little taper
4:46little cute with brush and I'm going to the local - hacia the back locate
4:51because i was studying my tip into bubbly and sunburst these two sides with
4:56like two top ones right here and dip into both of
4:58those start highlighting the bug
5:04do the bloke it's like ridiculous that locates are so fucking yeah this is why
5:12they are my favorites we have my back a while Tony 453 blend between the bronzer
5:18and highlighter
5:20Becca wild honey and mac warm soul top two blushes of literally all time and I
5:26like this one because it's more about burnt apricot color and which is great
5:29for more of a bronzy look it's not super like blushy it's a very just pretty
5:33bronzy natural blush color going to brush away the little nose contouring
5:38the funny thing about nose contouring sometimes you can beat the bitch fucking
5:41into the ground chisel her down to nothing to a toothpick and sometimes you
5:45have bad days and today is not my day
5:48okay so it's not right there with the nose we're gonna move on or you move on
5:51to the eyes the faces done I call it looks I think looks very pretty bronzy
5:55glowing and now it's a lot to the case
5:57so basically just fuck my life I finished filming the entire I look
6:02thinking it was on camera of course
6:04see if I care of course and turns out I didn't feel any of it those the off the
6:09entire time
6:10mhm mhm so how to wipe off
6:14one is I could show you guys what to do huh
6:18so let's go to start this one work back in time
6:22I'm gonna take the mac pro longwear concealer going to prime my lids with
6:26this concealer actually learn this trick from Jaclyn hill and the olden days when
6:30I watched your old videos should actually use a pro longwear concealer
6:32all the time as a primer on her eyes and I started you can get a maximum like I'm
6:37trying to wait like what John is talking about when i was working out and it
6:40worked really really well so I'm like you know what to do that again around
6:43mayo and so again right now so sure - Jacqueline again
6:46I came back at it again with the fucking tips and tricks this look is so freaking
6:50easy guys so like I'm not even that mad I didn't do it on camera back and we
6:54created very very easily
6:56I'm gonna be taking my man anyway and makeup geek palette today
7:00look at this little bastard is only fucking good I feel toward the fuck up
7:04because my mom was abused do
7:06i'm using this part today because I told you guys also try to incorporate this
7:09part as much as I can and tutorials for those of you guys who did get it and
7:12those you guys will want to get it
7:14you guys can definitely
7:15create so many different looks with this palette which is why I want to do as
7:18many as I possibly can
7:19that makes sense we're gonna go in with beaches and cream nice just be easy
7:22transition color
7:24absolutely love this color so much
7:27we'll get that into the lid with the morphe 27 rush next we're gonna take a
7:30scrap paper which is a nice beautiful maple brown tone on a morphine for 33
7:34that's gonna go on the outer corner of our I very much
7:38only on the outer corner and the powder third of the eye as well
7:42it's just gonna kind of trick the eye to give us more uplifted look on the outer
7:45corner when we do shadows out here
7:47that's what we're doing I'm just running out here not going too far in and
7:51breathing out with the e 27 just to make sure there's no harsh lines and edges
7:54you guys this looks so simple but that's kind of what I wanted it to be I want to
7:59be a nice pretty simple everyday look that you can do in your fucking sleep
8:04basically so next thing is we're going to go in with the morphe 32 and Artemis
8:07shadow
8:08it's a really pretty yellow champagne shade that's going to go all over the
8:12lid as are really pretty bright intense lip color
8:15luckily because it does have that nice golden undertone it's gonna look so nice
8:18on so many different tones even if you're darker complexion
8:21it will look a beautiful shimmering highlight color then taking that same
8:25and 43 with no additional product blending out the edges of Artemis just
8:29make sure there's no harsh lines and that is it for the top of the is super
8:33easy super simple just a pretty natural glow EULA been taking a more 4036 brush
8:38and mixing it with peaches and cream and Sora
8:41that's gonna be ran underneath the lower lash line just give me a little bit of
8:45definition on the lower lash line I don't like it when it's completely bare
8:48I just think I look really weird when I don't put a little bit of something down
8:50there I don't know I'm just like really weird about that
8:52are any of you guys worried about that like you guys have to push out those on
8:55the lower lash line or not just mean because I really I do
8:59I don't know why I just do and then we're going to take a little bit more of
9:02artemis and that's going to go on the brow bone to make sure we have a nice
9:06glowy effect like i was saying earlier and on the inner corner of quarters
9:09already technically curl the left at the end of mascara on them so they look
9:12fucking wonky as hell
9:14sorry about it because i had a wipe off the makeup I did that benefit roller
9:17lash on the top and I did not extend my google backlash on the bottom and also
9:22one more thing I forgot to do on this either already done this I i took the
9:25new aqua xli pencil by Makeup Forever
9:28they did a club with charli XCX dancer named and i'm going to take the yellow
9:32shade i'm gonna put that on the lower lash line on the lower waterline
9:36yellow is a brightening color it's a very very illuminating and awakening
9:39color so I'm very intrigued by doing a yellow pencil on the waterline I kind of
9:43like it
9:43so that's it for that I look I really think it's absolutely stunning you guys
9:47to keep it at this and be good to go
9:49but it's not a man you a tutorial without some lashes so I'm gonna put on
9:53a pair of lashes really quickly and i'll be right and once you put on a pair of
9:57serengeti lashes by a new bounce some this is what the look should look like
10:01I absolutely love these lashes let me go into any guys in to see what I look like
10:04up close
10:14great so now that we have the face completely done and eyes are already
10:16done as well i'm going to go ahead and do with the lips
10:19now i'm gonna do is just nice very pretty and natural it i'm gonna take the
10:22next peak of the neutral lip liner I think it's definitely time for me to get
10:27a new one

0:07everything that's fall inspired so I want to do another fall look but today I
0:12want to be a little different and do some color I haven't done anything like
0:15colorful colorful wise in a while so I thought why not incorporate green
0:19all I like smokey eye it's still incorporating color but it's still so
0:22fall appropriate and so beautiful and I think that this look turned out really
0:25really nicely for games like if you see any kind of like cracking in my face my
0:29eyes and my nose got really really really really running throughout this
0:32video because i want my allergies are starting to act up really badly and so I
0:36just couldn't stop anything like all my offices were just leaking
0:41I just sounds so fucking gross I look like kind of like a disaster right now I
0:44apologize i try to get through the tutorial as quick as I possibly could so
0:47that I wouldn't like be a gross mess be other than that you guys know the drill

1:01comment what you guys want to see you next week let's go ahead and get into
1:03this full face tutorial
1:08okay great so we're going to start this tutorial actually had no makeup on
1:11whatsoever i don't have moisturizer and I want to do a full face kind of thing I
1:14don't want to just kind of be like basic and just do that is even though I so the
1:17main point of this video I want to do kind of like a get ready with me style
1:21so yeah we're just going to go ahead and start doing the whole entire face let's
1:23start this bitch
1:24let's get started we're going to take the mineral primer veil by our class
1:29I haven't actually used on camera before but I used it a couple times actually
1:32like this primary uses when a couple times that's really nice oily skin feels
1:36really really nice expensive as hell though
1:38oh my god it's so expensive it doesn't give me like that silicone feeling and
1:40it doesn't fill in my pores like I wish that they were fills in
1:44but mama has big course so I like to cover that shit but that does not happen
1:47with these primer for foundation for taking the l oreal prom at infallible
1:51which is my father gave baby i'm gonna shade one of three natural buff
1:55I'm running out of this being severely and that was gonna put that on the
1:58t-zone with the Beauty Blender and damp Beauty Blender percent of the t-zone
2:01this foundation is just so good at it from the drugstore for cheap it was so
2:05good i put it mainly in the t-zone that that's right the most oily and this is
2:09more of a mattifying oil controlling foundation t-zone covered in the
2:12formation and everything else is left bare for the rest of this I'm gonna be
2:15going in with the makeup ever
2:17Ultra HD stick i use in my makeup forever tutorial will show you how to
2:20cover up the rest of my face mostly on the cheeks with the stick this is like a
2:23full coverage foundation that gives you more of a natural finish
2:26I'm gonna put that on the parameters of my face the reason I'm avoiding the
2:29t-zone is because this does not help prevent my oil whatsoever i gets the
2:33oily as hell want to use this mix and match people mix and match for whatever
2:37you need and years to perfect
2:40now my base is based on an extra concealer we're going to conceal these
2:43fucking bags back too bad they're not Chanel because I'm gonna take the
2:47Maybelline master class in the shade light
2:51I'm gonna take that underneath my highest is gonna go right from the tube
2:54I love this concealer
2:56i'm also going to have it with it as well it's just so good it's like full
3:01coverage
3:01super brightening but you need to say extremely fast like you can't like
3:04weight to set it because it will kind of get crazy and I'm gonna mix that with
3:07the map
3:08Prime in light boost just give me some more brightness underneath the eye
3:12you know - like to be highlighted to death and the beauty butter it out again
3:17and then taking my trusty bareminerals all arrested powder on am or PM 438

3:28rested add that is a huge difference in connection to look at this brightness
3:32and happiness and awakeness and look at that luggage it sleepy now for the
3:36highlight I'm gonna go in with just like a creepy way before I go in with powder
3:39ones later

3:42champagne highlighter i just got this recently and I haven't tried it yet so

3:48that over usual highlights go

3:56itself is very natural thing just gives you more like a glow from within
3:58actually really quite stunning wow very beautiful breast milk powder my face

5:32phone work and login good i think i want to do like a snapchat Q&A
5:36I think a lot of people have been doing like snapchat q and A's and like they've
5:39been going around for like a while now and people are doing them but i don't
5:42know if people want to look at people want to see that do you want to see
5:44snapchat Q&A to the Q&A like couple weeks ago that's the problem
5:47maybe I can do one like in a couple months are like a couple weeks when I my
5:51other Q&A is not so fresh
5:53I don't know what you guys think ok so this is the thing a lot of people always
5:55ask me like many why cant i send you any steps
5:58the reason you became semi snap is going to have its such a private to like
6:01people are only friends with can send me snaps and the reason is because i get a
6:04lot of snap views ok so when you get a lot of snap views and you have your snap
6:09set to public your snapchat will usually freeze because you're getting a lot of
6:13snapchats you know
6:14so that's kind of what the reason why I hey I haven't been able to really put it
6:18on the public because of my snapchat will freeze and I can't snap chat look
6:22it's not trying to like figure their shit out if you only does not sound
6:25promising in bronze and Rome how this video's not too long I just like I'm
6:28talking I'm very talkative today I just want to like talk to you guys more so
6:31forgetting to home
6:33forgive me i'm going with some blush i'm gonna take my morphe three brush and
6:36video blush by urban decay and never tried any of their blushes
6:40I just got someone recently and I really wanted to try it out that's pretty good
6:42so nice like it's like a flush color to the rose pink rose pink there we go on
6:45like what the fuck are you
6:46ok so now i'm going to shade and light palette by Kat Von D I'm gonna take my
6:50favorite like contouring brush now of all time then make a geek chisel cheek
6:54brush basically this brush and take the shape this brush has really rebound by
6:59contouring who is calling me
7:01the reason why i love this brush the bristles are extremely soft and the
7:04length of them is perfect it's a it is the perfect brush basically okay so you
7:08guys know like about the heater brush than ours eat it's a really extremely
7:11popular brush that is used for like bronzing and contouring right
7:15I have the heater brush and I really don't like it talked about my channel
7:17before like that i don't like the nausea , see when i first tried i was expecting
7:20something like life-changing
7:22I thought was gonna be amazing and i only got it cannot wait to try this out
7:25hated it
7:25like I litigated and also what the fuck why do I hate this brush you know
7:28finally realized that the bristles were just not the kind of bristle I like I
7:31don't like tough bristles like that it was a really tough
7:34for me to use so whenever you see this brush this is exactly everything I
7:37wanted from the EDA like that's why i like this so much i feel like this brush
7:40has like really rebound to my contouring game because it's just so ridiculously
7:45soft
7:46it's so good honestly I don't even know what to say about it like without
7:48looking like a cheese ball but it's seriously amazing because almost done
7:52now i'm going to highlight for reals like on top of my house later I'm so
7:54excited to finally be able to use this on camera because they're actually out
7:56now I felt so bad using before this is the Anasazi is so Hollywood highlighter
8:00i've been using these highlights of the past couple months and i am obsessed
8:03I'm gonna take my morphine and 510 brush and just get right into it and start
8:08highlighting with it i'm obsessed
8:11maybe I was a little too much
8:14oh my god I was like why is looking so crazy right now but i just realized i
8:17have cream highlighter underneath its type on a little bit of that out
8:21perfect so we have the base of the face completely blew me just a little bit
8:24nose contouring I've been really into nose contouring lately I don't know why
8:27it's just been like something I've been wanting to do but i've been using this
8:29little makeup geek brush I'm using this low shade over here
8:33dusting off a very little better when he's a very small amount of it and just
8:35been kind of contouring my nose with this brush is very very very lightly
8:41like nothing too crazy because I don't like to do a heavy nose contour I feel
8:43like it could mean you look real like fucked up real quick
8:46but this brush is pretty freaking perfect for a nose contour kit it's so
8:50thin but like the bristles are so nice like they're just so good
8:53boom with that snatch knows do you think that was like 30 seconds or so now that
8:58we're done with the face we're going to do the eyes now and let's go ahead and
9:01get ready for that
9:03I so I done in July balls
9:06so we can focus on the boys so we can finish the ice I don't know how I don't
9:09know why I suddenly going to accent sometimes I just do i'm really weird i
9:13love accents for some reason I just really - already filled in my brows off
9:17of camera and i already put on my primer by using Smashbox 24-hour as always it's
9:22the best one I've ever used for oily lids if you have greasy late it's the
9:25best primer I'm not getting started going to some shades now this is my
9:29color I'm going to work with
9:30I want to do like something like different something more colorful than
9:32usual so wish me luck because i feel like i do neutrals very well but I don't
9:36do color super super well all the time for she was I don't ever work with like
9:39green and
9:40take a mixture of beaches and cream hand this beautiful warm orange shade that
9:49shall not be named
9:51I'm gonna put that in the crease with a morphy 27 brush just go into the crease
9:55it is such a gorgeous like warm transition I want it to be really warm
9:59in the crease I think that's really great when you're doing like colorful
10:01things on the lid like I love to do a nice warm transition shade just kind of
10:05tie everything together that makes sense that see this nice beautiful warm a warm
10:09crease so now i'm going to go in with dirty martini by makeup geek and i'm
10:13going with that on a morphine and 43 and it's just a really nice olive green
10:18shade it's very very pretty i'm gonna be putting that on the outer corner and
10:21into the crease lower than we have that nice warm transition shade
10:26I'm taking out all the way into the front of the I just nice light motions
10:30flipping the brush upwards to put it into the warm crease perfect so now I'm
10:34just going with a black base i'm gonna be using the morphe gel liner in slate
10:37it is a really nice just black eyeliner but i'm gonna use it as my base today I
10:41want to go to more of a smoky look I've decided so we take a little bit on a
10:44morphine ether t2 packing brush and I'm going to run that on the lid close to
10:48the lash line
10:49it's so black and so creamy it's the oh it's so good all the way up to that
10:54dirty martini color as soon as i'm getting higher and higher i'm using
10:57lighter pressure and blending downwards so i can have a nice little blend
11:03we have a nice black bass down looks look alive uh-huh
11:06I'm gonna grab a mixture of high tea and dirty martini on this just sigma e30 two
11:11brushes like a nice just packing brush I'm going to pack that on the entire lid
11:15to give me a nice green olive green base I'm using the black bass down first cuz
11:19i like the way that a black base gives you dimension for this kind of color it
11:23just it makes it look so beautiful
11:25I'm taking that right up to the dirty martini color just concentrate on
11:28packing on the color which is something like this it's nice green all of shade
11:32and
11:33we're going to take that for three again and then mix dirty martini and high tea
11:37on the brush and just go into that crease and just blend away in to the
11:40warm orange shade that we have going on
11:44I was like so nervous to do this - I'm like fucking all of green smokey eye
11:49with a little i think i am I think I'll go back in without a nice warm shade
11:52with peaches and cream mix just kind of go over the edge is still slightly I
11:56still wanted to be really warm and I want to try to lose any of that warmth
11:59in the crease because i don't like it to be too cool tone or two green
12:03I guess you could say i want to have some nice depth and dimension and he
12:07doesn't like this so far
12:08Yeah Yeahs perfect together both of the tops of the thighs done it's nice and
12:11blended I think it looks really really nice and I feel like it looks very
12:15festive it's very different for me i don't really ever do like green or blue
12:18or things like that but i really want to start venturing out into the world and i
12:21think it looks really beautiful especially with that like nice
12:23orangi warm transition and like a nice dark lid i love it I love it I love it I
12:27love it we're going to be taking the tart inner rim liner is just like a
12:30black eyeliner and I'm going to line the waterline
12:33this is where this is like one of the creepiest liners I've ever freaking
12:36trying it is so creamy and then tight line as well so it's going to take a
12:40little bit of the black along the lash line
12:42make sure you call your lashes to with the eyeliner if you want any like a
12:45little like missing like skin spots you know I know it looks really Jenky as
12:48hell but that's okay because we're gonna pick set
12:51so now i'm taking morphine and 508 i use as much all the time i was going to
12:54smudge out the top liner is very very creamy so buns up really easily and now
12:59course we need to be going over it with green again I'm gonna take a mixture
13:04again a dirty martini and high tea
13:07i'm using my 36 and blend that over the black I want to be exactly the same as
13:11it is on the top and this will take a little bit of time just to cover all the
13:14black
13:16and then take that nice orange shade again and then go ahead and blend out
13:19that dirty martini adjust some nice warm to give it more dimension not make it
13:24look so harsh and start you know to me
13:28ok so basically i had to like turn off the camera because my eyes were going
13:31crazy like i might already started acting really bad no sorry running
13:34really bad in my eyes are watering so right now i have a spot in my high that
13:38it will not take liner so I'm just gonna skip past I mean I've been waiting for
13:41like 10 minutes to like let it like subside so i can put eyeliner there but
13:44it just will not take whatsoever it's too watery
13:47so I'm just gonna have to deal with it for now I'm just shit happens I went
13:50ahead and applied mascara off Karen just cuz I didn't know like what the fuck
13:53expect this I so i did that on camera
13:56I'm going to play some lashes because its eyes is much more smoking intense
13:59i'm going to be using my bella lashes from new band from these lashes kill me
14:04they just make everything so much better than what it was originally basically i
14:08tried to do this last step but I'm gonna take shimma shimma as my highlight on am
14:12or PM 3267 put on inner corner of my eyes
14:15it's really brighten it up I whatever being really Ted smoky eye
14:18I want to go really heavy with the highly on the inner corner and the eyes
14:22just like you like it really it really brings it look together a little bit on
14:26the brow bone as well just a smidgen
14:28and now the eyes are officially complete i'm going to begin to see what they look
14:33like

2:40want to start getting into it
2:41just jump right in and film with every thinks I'm not a lot of you guys do tell

2:48eyes are like one particular things so I'm just listening to you guys more than
2:52doing what you guys asked me i am your fucking slave
2:55first things first I'm going private with you make it four ever step one step
3:00one skin equalizer base in smoothing literally you can see that I've had some
3:05lovin
3:05Pat it on my nose and on the center of my face and it really does conceal the
3:10appearance of my pores and when i'm going to make up all day
3:12it just like looks nice it looks really really nice and it helps with my oil a
3:17little bit as well because it is a smoothing silicon e primary great for
3:21the center of the face i'm not going with the lorry ella no Matt and fallible
3:24you guys know that one of my favorite foundations
3:26honestly it's just such a good foundation and yes to the drugstore and
3:2828 bucks
3:29I'm gonna put that on the t-zone with the burner awesome romance novel is in
3:33the center and then for the rest of the face i'm going to go in with the do your
3:36air flash foundation my favorite foundation of all time this is literally
3:39number one foundation for me
3:41you really can't go wrong I swear to such a beautiful foundation i'm going to
3:44use the shape 300 for my face
3:46it is not my shade I do know that it does a little bit darker but no fucks
3:50given
3:51I'm just gonna bounce that in with the view under usually I'll take this
3:54foundation on a like flat top kabuki brush or something like that but I just
3:57been using it with the Beauty Blender recently and I noticed that my skin has
4:01been looking so fucking be like so nice with a Beauty Blender when im using it
4:05just I don't know I feel like I'm really working the foundation into my skin like
4:09really just pressing it in working it in and I've noticed that it really does
4:12make a difference when im using it with a blender rather than aim laptop the
4:16bookie
4:17but I'm either way both work great awesome stuff we can see that I'm gonna
4:20be going in with two colors from the naked wait list can see their line from
4:23urban decay
4:24I'm gonna be taking the shades light neutral and shades fair neutral and i
4:28just--literally i just love these considers soul much
4:31it's just beautiful like full coverage consistency it's like light weight to it
4:35is that the weirdest thing I don't know how to explain the consistency of this
4:37can see that but it's just so nice
4:39so first I'm going with the darker one closest to my eyes because it has more
4:42pink undertone so take the lighter one and put that
4:45lower than the other concealer and it's going to start blending out with the
4:49Beauty Blender know that we already used before so I think it's been I feel like
4:52I've been gone for so fucking long which I really have been i've been gone for
4:55three weeks
4:563 21 days I've been gone that's so long i'm filming in 21 days what I really
5:02have filled with Jeffrey present rolls-royce video which was so fun to do
5:07he's gonna be doing a new series on his channel called like a rolls-royce get
5:10ready and I think it's a freaking genius idea
5:13so that was really fun by having feelings like at home or for my own
5:17channel and literally like three weeks the funny thing too is I still have like
5:20two videos i have three films that have you put up yet so I'm going to bring
5:23those up very very soon
5:24I just like to really film when i get right back home because I feel like I
5:27forgot how to film so i need to get into it you know
5:29so I'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent setting powder and this be
5:3248 brush and just set the under eye and for the rest of this i'm going to take
5:36the ultra definition of loose powder by urban decay on b.e.t morphe brush and
5:40just set that all over the damn face just to set everything make sure nothing
5:45is going to be moving around
5:46I think it's absolutely beautiful it gives you like HD finish and when you're
5:51going for you too honey
5:52HD is what mama lon ok and I'd like to concentrate on the edges of my face and
5:56then I kind of bring it in because this is a shade of a little darker than me
5:59already went with the darker and make sure that i need to go to the dark about
6:02or do I don't think it
6:04do not neglect the neck because you already know
6:07just don't do it I really don't like to take liquids and very often
6:10liquid foundation like to take powders on my neck to match everything because
6:13if you like it so much faster and easier and I don't know the locals are just so
6:16weird eleniak don't like it I'll do it sometimes but not too often
6:21let's go ahead and highlight the under is really quickly with the market since
6:24to mark powders my favorite dry powder it's absolutely stunning with the same
6:2840 brush
6:29you got this powder it works so so good
6:32like fuck me sideways with a chainsaw
6:36you know it's not too too yellow and I looks yellow in the pan
6:39it doesn't come off like yellow you know what i mean so if you ever want a nice
6:42powder for the under eyes i know i've talked about it in a favorites video
6:44before

8:44is one of the most intensely highlighting bright highlighting how
8:47they never use every jacket was the first 1i think to talk about this on her

8:58one of them
8:59I literally saw that and I was like oh um I need it
9:04I'm taking this little kid right here this is a highlight that's like really
9:09really brighten really intense so if you're the average person that doesn't
9:11like a bright and intense highlight work
9:14you can literally stuck in cause accidents
9:17I am the LA so I think Jackson really started a trend here with this
9:22bright-ass highlight and let's all think of right now I think Jacqueline hope for
9:27this highly because i don't think i've ever had highlighted this bright in my
9:30entire life

10:10I'm going to take my morphe 27 and I'm very very very light layer of Courtney
10:14which is a nice just like pretty neutral brown crease shade and that's gonna go
10:18into the crease very lightly this in your transition machine
10:22I'm not to put a lot of it at all though - I system
10:24shade because i don't want it to be too intense but i do want to have something
10:27that people blend into because I'm an idea of what I want to do today and it
10:30involves the pink
10:31so we can take a little bit of this color there we go very very just soft
10:35nice easy transition and then I'm going with more p.m. for 33 and I'm gonna take
10:41this shade star power which is like a bright ass ping shan that's gonna go
10:45into the crease I feel like I want to do like a nice pink crease white lid blue
10:50under I just very very Barbie kind of look and I know a lot of people looking
10:53at this kind of thing in my , couple shades are really really bold but why
10:56not use those shades that people are gonna be like steering away from into
11:00this video so I'm gonna go ahead and put star power into the crease it's a nice
11:05hot pink
11:06look at that pigment though wow ok the first time using it you guys like this
11:09is like we're using this together
11:11taking it all the way into the inner corner and now we have this is really
11:14hot pink crease
11:16I don't know everything looks so cool I just blend it out a little bit with a 27
11:20again this pink is like more than neon bright pink did everyone make sure the
11:23edges are clean so that might take the shade vanity on a morphine 18 inches are
11:27packing up on the outer corner
11:28just give me a little bit of definition it's like a purple color very small
11:32amount of it because I don't want it to be a main focus of this look just a
11:35little bit of the outer corner it's a nice like deep blemish great almost with
11:39a pink I'm gonna blend that out something like this now it's nice dark
11:43outer corner amazing finale of the darkness on the outer corners looking
11:46like this very nice and just edgy and having some more dimension I'm gonna be
11:50taking favorite brush at the moment more p.m. - 10 i talked about this already in
11:53my last favorite video such a good packing brush and not the shade china
11:57white which could actually be like my favorite shade in this entire pallet
12:01it's so so so nice it's like a nice just creamy white color
12:05so pigmented and i love this Shane's online and 43 just blend out those edges
12:13a little bit
12:13I just looks very like barbie glam so I want to do eyeliner I'm gonna do
12:17black eyeliner and take the kat von d tattoo trooper liner and i'm going to do
12:21a wing just feel that bad boy in
12:25great we have the eyeliner on it now and as you can see just adds a really cool
12:29extra cat-like definition that makes it much more wearable to like the pink in
12:32the crease I know it's kind of scary to some people but it makes it much more
12:35when you do a nice eyeliner look like this so i wanted to add a nice bold
12:39freaking eyeliner just a fucking cut about that they try you
12:42it's not like that so not going to be taking a more 1536 and the shade
12:47expensive and that's gonna go on the bottom lash line if it's a blue shade
12:51with nice like satin finish like a little small like sparkles of like
12:54silver sword on the bottom lash line and really Barbie this bitch
12:58oh you know I mean I feel like a little awkward princess
13:01I really don't want to get Kourtney just to blend out the blue and I just helped
13:04with the appearance of a blend so it looks dark hearts you know I mean I
13:10found this island my color pop that looks so cute a periwinkle color in the
13:13shape
13:14france and i think this is what I do in the water line and I know it's not the
13:17same exact color anything but it's just the same color family
13:21it's along those lines blue paint
13:24periwinkle we're going to do it okay
13:29you guys want to do something so bold going to use a freaking cream liner a
13:33black liner doesn't really matter

1:14going ok great so we're going to start this video i already have my base on
1:18like I'm a foundation my contour highlight
1:20I just feel like this look is all about that I Sarge wanted to quickly rushed
1:24through the face
1:25I did not melt lipstick swatches if you want a lot of you guys would like to do
1:28a look with the Dark Matter stack or any of the stacks melt because they're
1:31really good stacks and they have a great shadows I told you guys about them
1:34so for this look I'm going to be using the Dark Matters back from melt
1:38sooo i think so
1:41then we're going to live in the first we're gonna start off with the shadow
1:44blur which is basically like a nice little PG just neutral beige color it's
1:49very similar to like peach smoothie and beaches and cream by makeup geek which
1:53is like that nice transition if you don't have the shadows totally fine just
1:56kind of find the equivalent you guys do have I'm gonna go and take a t27 morphe
2:00brush and other newly brushes you guys know the brushes off my finger morphe
2:04brushes that they came out with their so good i'm going to add that into my
2:07crease my lids already primed and my brows already filled in just a heads or
2:12because you got to thinking what the fuck are you doing no I'm ready and
2:15ready primed so I'm gonna run that into the crease it's such a pretty transition
2:19color i absolutely love it
2:21so nice just chill baby i'm going to you guys in a little bit closer exactly like
2:25you can't really see but now i'm going to mix unseen and enigmatic these two
2:28colors are here
2:29nice like neutral brown with a nice really warm cranberry red that come on
2:33red tone mixed with like a brown neutral Brown is like my favorite and they're
2:36just kind of thinking on your feet and 4 33 you guys know it's my favorite movie
2:40brush basically ever and I'm going to put on the outer corner
2:42I'm going to run it on the outer corner don't need me to meet with it but you do
2:46want to place in like a certain spot because this is going to be like a halo
2:48I don't bring it too far in
2:50just keep on the outer third of your eye right up into the crease and then do the
2:53same thing on the front of the I like the front third part as well start on
2:57the lid and bring it up into the crease it should look something like this just
3:00by placing the color down and now i'm going to go and make that halo effect
3:03I'm not picking up any more product i'm just literally lightly blending from the
3:06first third of the third with no additional product i'm just literally
3:11using whatever i have left on the brush and blending across to make this nice
3:14halo effect in keeping the center of the eye completely bearing then I'm going to
3:18grab that same a 27 by Morsi and blend out the edges of the shadows blend so
3:24freakishly nicely i was like shocked when first using I was like no no and
3:30then go ahead and bring it out slightly over here on the harder third
3:33it's nice to have something like this is like a nice warm cranberry brown tone -
3:37it's so pretty it's nice and blended want to like this look is so simple that
3:42you guys are gonna be like oh my god the fucking thing I'm really having alright
3:46so now we have the base of our halo I kind of done we're going to shade dark
3:51matter which is the black in this little quad
3:53I'm gonna take a very small amount of it because it is extremely pigmented is
3:57such a good black name or Fiji 36 which is my favorite pencil browsable damn tom
4:02you know that we have a code monkey man you will get you ten percent off
4:05I'm just like I'm gonna fill it with more you guys know a lot of you guys
4:07know this little you guys don't if you're new to my channel
4:10not only is my favorite brush brand of all time but honestly my favorite
4:13affiliates to be part of because they're just good people you know more fees such
4:16a good brand and they have such good quality and I'm just really proud to be
4:19familiar with them you know
4:20so we're not gonna take that black I'm gonna take it on the front right before
4:23the inner corner
4:24I'm just going to feather that forward maybe 36 and the same on the outer
4:27corner i'm gonna put it on the corner
4:29feather it forward and then take that and for three again and blend out that
4:33black into the previous colors just to make the transition a lot more seamless
4:37just one more easy just doing circular motions inside
4:40that's why i will give you a nice really pretty gradient this is all i need to do
4:43for the help are like the halo I part is done
4:46the middle of my is completely open and that's what I'm gonna be putting the
4:48glitter or whatever we're going to be using much of a planner you want to
4:52remember to keep blending through each step you know what I mean you wanted to
4:55be a very seamless easy transition so it's kind of a point of this whole thing
4:59but I use a two-faced glitter glue to go ahead and put that all over the middle
5:03part of the lid
5:04the only thing that should be about this glitter glue is that it will take off
5:06the product underneath your eye
5:08it's kind of sticky so you have to be cautious of that like shadow underneath
5:12this it will take off the shadow and then the star of the show which a lot of
5:16people have been asking me about this glitter
5:18it's the body sparkles silver by England's like one of the most gorgeous
5:23glitters I've ever tried to take a 3d glitter from Maxine's similar to that
5:27and then I'm going to take a more feet
5:29320 and this is just a really great precision packing brush and that's what
5:33you really want to do you want to go to be flying everywhere you know what i
5:35mean so that's going to use i'm just going to go into the glitter dust off
5:38the excess and start pressing in the center of my not going too far up just
5:44where you put the glitter glue out and you want to just put it on the mobile
5:48lid you don't want it to be too far up because it's going to transfer your eyes
5:51are open so she looks something like this
5:53if you notice that the glitter is like not blend it a little bit stark then you
5:57can go and go back in with the same blending brush and just kind of go over
6:00the glitter slightly without like messing with it
6:03- too much i'm gonna say it's hard to blend glitter obviously he's gonna want
6:07to be cautious and like blend around it make it look a little more seamless if
6:10that's what you want
6:11I'm going to finish this thing off camera real quick and I'll be right back
6:14perfect now both of the eyes are done this is what it looks like I'm obsessed
6:18with this google it
6:20this critter is everything so now i'm going to go ahead to the bottom of the
6:24eye on this side I'm going to take that nigga
6:27unseen one more time on my same you 36 I wiped away the Dark Matter color from it
6:32because it was like obviously black want to run that underneath the eye on the
6:35outer corner and then on the inner corner as well now I keep a little small
6:39baby space in the middle just empty
6:41I'm going to take the same glitter glue it was underneath there a little baby
6:45well that face though only a mother could love
6:49just for shits and giggles you don't want to do this at all i'm taking boom
6:52boom room by Mac you guys know this is like one of my favorite - I was that
6:56they were released and told us to buy it
6:57this is another way to incorporate it i'm gonna put that right underneath to
7:00give me that really cool intense sheen on the bottom two
7:03that's so fucking bad ass dude might take a little bit baby amount of dark
7:10matter the black to add a little bit more dimension
7:19yeah
7:20it should look something like this for the waterline i'm going to the England
7:24kohl pencil number five which is basically a nude liner
7:27don't put that in the water line like this look is so grungy so like yeah this
7:32is not like a normal everyday look but fuck it
7:37I already curled my lashes and apply mascara on so i'm going to take the new
7:40bounce on the faction lash this is a collaboration with one of my friends and
7:44his name's Alex faction on youtube he is a fellow youtuber and he's like a
7:48special effects body painting kind of youtuber and he did a collaboration with
7:51new bounce some which has no Bella means from the balance of my favorite lashes
7:55of all time
7:56like literally ever let's do this faction / actually never worn these are
8:00the first time this is the first time I remember you were trying on the slash do
8:03this
8:04yeah these are cute
8:10please give you that nice like outer corner extension these letters are
8:13really like natural like this if you are going to more of a natural lashes like
8:16great giving you like the next hour corner wing
8:19these are great is totally like you need to do and I'll inner wing with this kind
8:23of latch it's actually really great that you don't need to
8:25I like lashes that are a little more full of more 3d that's just my personal
8:28preference but these are really nice lashes for those of you who like that
8:31natural lash look you know and this is what it looks like with the lashes on
8:36I'm going to you guys in to see what the final looks like up close and personal
8:47perfect the eyes are done and we are running so long
8:52ok so now i'm going to do some blush because i have my contour and highlight
8:54on not like highlight but like I did on door I'm going to take mac blush and
8:59warm salt an oldie but goodie on my morphe 3 i'm really hoping the the leads
9:04are back in stock the code want us to get some punk
9:08so I'm just going to run that on the apples of my cheeks blend into my
9:12contour
9:13I love this blush warm soul is one of my top blushes of like life
9:17it is so good ok and now for the highlight is the first time using this
9:22on camera and i love it and I'm dying and live and breathe for it
9:26this is the laura geller gilded honey I'm gonna take that on am or PM 501 is
9:30one of your brushes to highlight with it really is
9:33ok ok hmm
9:36since the eye is obviously like the most important part of this look at so
9:40dramatic
9:41I want to keep the lips really neutral gonna take next people neutral lip liner
9:44and why my life
9:45oh I'm lined and I'm going to go and take serenity and put that on my lips
9:50it's honestly just the perfect like warm brownish pink and put that on my list
10:01and I'm going to let that dry and I'm gonna go to a nude lipstick on top just
10:04to really like tie it all together
10:06honestly you could leave it like this is perfect it's such a neutral color it's
10:10not going to interfere with the violence whatsoever but I'm gonna go and make it
10:12a little bit lighter because I wanted to be like almost like a blocked out late
10:15but not too blocked out i'm going to take YSL number one it's like my
10:19favorite one is a lipstick and I'm gonna get that all over the lips it's a very
10:22light baby pink and the reason i have started he as my base is going to give
10:25me more dimension and keep the lipstick on a lot longer
10:28I love the way the Y so looks like smell this but like mango and it should look
10:31something like nothing
10:34and so this is what the final comes out to be I want to see love this look I
10:38think it's so different so unique it's so like weird and kind of grungy but
10:42still glam at the same time and I know it's definitely on the dramatic side I
10:46think it's a badass though honestly like I don't want to just do
10:48natural natural and all the time you know of a natural smoky and why not go

2:26make tutorials with this palette has forget possible without getting annoying
2:30so this is the first one and i am so excited to show you guys
2:33so let's get into it great so first things first we're going to be taking
2:37beaches and cream and a mixture of Sora on e 27 brush and that's just going to
2:42make our own custom transition shade i love doing this especially with these
2:45two colors sore is a very beautiful burnt orange shade and beaches and cream
2:48is a very pretty neutral like transition chain putting those into my crease with
2:5527 brush not just going to go all the way and as you can see it's depositing
2:58such a nice amount of color
3:00I love doing this with any 27 because i feel like the 27 brush my morphe is so
3:04fluffy and it deposits a really really nice range of color rather than just
3:08putting too much on or too little on you're going to see just how easy this
3:11look at you guys are gonna be like yes bitch
3:15as you can see it is a nice orangi transition with the crease
3:19nothing to him the clothes are extremely pigmented so you don't you put a lot of
3:22product on it and it's really a Bob
3:24ok taking a more free and for 33
3:27this is really nice do for the mac 217 or Sigma e25 I'm gonna go in with frappe
3:34which is a permanent shade by making me twitch a beautiful like maple brown
3:37color and I think this shade in the crease is so stunning
3:41I'm just going to pack it onto the outer corner just to give such a nice
3:44definition and really pretty warm to the look at to go all the way in which is
3:49very light hand with that you don't want to go too heavy
3:52it's very lightly go all the way in
3:54and then take that you 27 one more time just going to blend out of those edges
3:58you guys make a geek shadows because I've ever tried to keep shadows you know
4:01that the blendabilities Nicki shadows are literally so good
4:07it's insane up on the are you have something like this nice we just warm
4:11crease and the fuck is next pitch what the heck of it
4:15we're gonna go in with Aphrodite which is a beautiful plumage brown shade it's
4:20stunning is a very deep color on a morphy e36 pencil brush
4:24I just want to keep the color very concentrated where I wanted to be
4:26something using a pencil brush you can use any brush you want to use it for me
4:29a pencil brush works really great with this kind of look I'm just on the outer
4:32corner and drag it up into my crease with the product i have left on the
4:38brush
4:43and i'm looking at about one third of the way into my high and taking it for
4:47three one more time I'm going to blend out that Aphrodite shade into the
4:50previous two shades just make the blend a lot more seamless I really wanted to
4:54be a very seamless easy blend this look is really definitely my everyday look
4:57because I just think it's absolutely perfection
5:00not to be a bitch and not to be biased but I think it's perfection
5:04you should have something like this now that we're rocking that crease hardcore
5:08taking a little bit of fix plus i'm going to spray my morphine for 21 which
5:12is not very flat packing brush just a little bit of X plus on it because I
5:15feel like for a foil shadow and makes it look like a lot more intense and like
5:19oil you know to me it's just gonna do on this brush and then I take the shade at
5:22luna which is a beautiful to be pink color
5:25it's a very intense shine color i'm gonna go ahead and put that on the lid
5:29know i'm doing a mixture of both
5:31packing and wiping emotions that's kind of how i like to do the foil shadows by
5:36makeup geek and make sure when you're using a foil shadow using the correct
5:39primary for your i am really really oily lids you want to use a primer that's
5:42good for oily lids like me
5:44I use the Smashbox 24 hour one or the map won the 24 hour Mac one whatever
5:49it's called is really really good too because they are very hardcore and
5:52silicon and they're going to help keep the oil of your legs at bay which is
5:55what i need for foil shadow if you have tried using foil child before an
6:00increased on you try using a primer that is very good for oily lids I'm just
6:04going all the way up to front pay like this and then to get a 40 one more time
6:09we're going to blend out those edges very very lightly though I really don't
6:13mind it being kind of harsh because I think it kind of looks cool but I'm
6:17going to keep the edges a little bit on the softer side
6:20my first stop of the iso then I'm going to take the shade arguments with a very
6:23pretty golden like a pale gold champagne shade on am3 26 by morphine is a very
6:30small detail brush it's great for the problem grief in her corner so I want to
6:33do on the highlight of the problem with this shade very very very lightly though
6:39because this is a very very intensely reflecting shade as you can see it's
6:43like button on the inner corner as well
6:46same brush such a pretty according to see a shit
6:50do you see that shit o Lord O my lord jesus
6:53okay so I'm gonna go and finish the other eye on top of it
6:56off of camera and then I'll be right back hey guys i went ahead and i did my
7:00mascara eye lashes and liner off camera
7:03I went ahead and just do that i really want to just kind of focus on the
7:05shadows because that is what this tutorial is because I see me do I wonder
7:08so many so many times
7:09really want to keep it focused on the shadows
7:13ok and i want you guys to like inspiration with the shadows you've been
7:16doing with this looks or not you can do lashes with this look or not it doesn't
7:19matter
7:20imagine the bottom lash line now so I want you guys to that part just in case
7:22you guys are carriages so much like i'm going to go ahead and take sora on a 18
7:28pencil brush my morphe this is a really really great pencil brush with a very
7:31fluffy pencil brush rather than being so compact like the e36 is so I'm gonna
7:35take that on the lower lash line and just really run that underneath and
7:38start building up that nice orange you transition color
7:41so now we have soared down first so it just looks like a nice just orangie
7:44underneath the eye transition shade
7:46no I'm going back in with that - 36 just kind of just off whatever color you have
7:50left another 30-60 might have a little bit of Aphrodite left for taking fat pay
7:53and that's not going to her corner and talk about half way in to the I the
7:58beautiful like brownish maple shade is just stunning
8:01I free to go about halfway in on the e36 pencil brush just kind of buff out and
8:06give me some more color and dimension on the outer corner taking in be 43 I swear
8:11expressions like my life saver taking me 43 buy morphine and Aphrodite one more
8:15time and that's gonna go tight line on the bottom lash line
8:18about one-third in
8:24just to keep the darkness on the outer corner just like i did with the top and
8:30doing the same thing on the bottom like this and then taking the e36 and
8:33blending that out a little bit more just what it looks so harsh and start there
8:38and then grabbing any nude liner i'm going to take the tart in a room liner
8:42the new chairman put on the inner rim of my I just going to be more of an open a
8:45wake look that's the look i like to go for with this shadow combination and
8:49then adding a little bit of mascara to the bottom lashes as well
8:53ok guys so it's going to me to see what I look like up close and personal
9:03and that is if my entire tutorial is about him coming I like chills just

0:26weird someone hot mess
0:28so let's just jump right into it so many people requested for me to do that like
0:32green and wright smokey eye so I thought I would feel right now I'm kind of 6 i'd
0:36love to hear in my voice but i had the sniffles and so much i hate it as much
0:40as i can look around like you know I mean some let's just get right into the
0:44beyond hope you guys like it and let's just jump right in
0:49yeah
0:52first let's go ahead and we're going to do with the whole face today healthy so
1:01we're going to go in with the YSL fusion foundation in the color warm ivory this
1:07is a gift from one of my friends and must use it in a store window I had like
1:11a something facial hair beard this thing going on right now if you're gonna might
1:15as well do it more sheer to medium coverage foundation so it doesn't really
1:19interfere with the beard area i love this smell this foundation so until the
1:23roses and I was put on the back of my head and just smear it on and then we're
1:26going to go in with the morphe and 439 haven't used this pressure i keep
1:30hearing about great things about it's a huge cube-like buffing brush and so I'm
1:34really excited transplant out i'm just gonna present into my face the
1:37foundation in oh I get it
1:42project start using this one all the time he always tells me that such a
1:44great brush for like that your brush finish and foundations I feel like a
1:48little bit late for me i know i'm already like ghostly pale but I know
1:51these foundations a little bit like but for me I to go in with some people there
1:54a little bit lighter than me that we can always bronze up after you know and I
1:58try to avoid the under eye area as much as much as I can be somewhere I can go
2:01to concealer under that not only one with mac pro longwear concealer and NW
2:0620 minutes and golden heart I like to go pretty hammered concealer and on the
2:10islands to prime for our eye shadow and then we're going with the morphe m35
2:16which is basically the mini baby concealer version of them i am
2:20obsessed with the stretch i've been using it quite a lot actually and i love
2:23this because it really picks up anything I don't mean like all the excess product
2:26I don't need on the brush that shit huh week the fuck
2:32hey I was running the brush and you are i might need a little more coverage i
2:37usually have a little more breakouts my forward a little bit over with a little
2:40bit more foundation on that area i do love this foundation I really do
2:44don't think I mean I've said before the only thing i don't like about it is that
2:47if i have any dry patches it tends to pick up my dry patches a little bit and
2:50I don't like that all baby i need you to cover the show that's wrong with you
2:56I look like fucking Casper i'm using LA girl Pro powder
3:00I've never used this power on myself so I'm here to see how this looks fucking

3:10this large natural hair fluffy brush that's extremely soft go right into that
3:14Shin just doubled my things
3:17okay too bad it's not so bad i'm not gonna lie something that I can each d
3:24silicon layer you know let's go ahead and broad real quick because I feel like
3:29I look like hot ass men
3:32ok we're going to one with the self p cosmetics 1 of 1 which is this like
3:38taper paddle fluffy brush and the morphe control palette and we got the machine
3:42was going to run in my areas that i like to call the roll

5:11morphy g8 brush what's going on are blush area
5:17nothing too crazy don't just look so chipper for the highlight we're gonna go
5:23in with our escort or powder made with mack daddy remain fantasy which is
5:27basically that this reflect teal blue highlighter and I figured you to lip i'm
5:31doing a green right smoky why not go ahead with the highway it's different
5:36I don't give a shit Colonel the limited come to our spring that on the more
5:40people used to have in our area with I'm gonna dust it on the highlighted plans
5:47you just gave me this really cool very different kind of highlight you know
5:52like it literally looks like it's highlighted but it gives you that nice
5:56greenish tone to it can blame I think it looks super freaking cool
6:02I mean of course you guys don't have to go in with the Greenwich highlight but
6:04that's not normal but you know what I was thinking when I woke up this morning
6:10the first thought in my head was in life don't know what I'm gonna bloom
6:14yes page you had so now that we have that nice intense as they going on
6:20within that fluffy pressures really kind of just blend the two together the blush
6:25and highlight just kind of really married much better
6:27it's very different and I like it I don't give a shit so i would say that my
6:31face is pretty much time have we got into a thing um let's go ahead and do
6:37one I doubt the actually no we're going to browse I'm gonna go to the browser
6:40real quick off camera because I think forever and a time so I'll just go to my
6:45grams of camera and i'll be back so we have our brows done I I was really
6:51trying to go for more of a natural brow but it and start to turn more and more
6:54fleek as we continued so we'll just go with it i'm not going to come off and do
7:00it again
7:00oh just go right to it so that is i'm gonna try to do you guys say for the
7:04eyes more because you guys have been requesting me to do that suburbs really
7:08try to sell the shit and I just get nervous because my faith is my perfect
7:14ok that will resume into the eye area hope you guys are happy we're going with
7:18makeup geek beaches and cream on a sigma e40 that's not right into our crease
7:24area senior transition shade as you guys already saw we had already primed with
7:27um with a consistent format or you can go in with that teaches in current let's
7:31go right into our crease area donated you need to put that bitch in there are
7:36trying to quantify
7:37I'm i grabbed vanilla bean and make it as well it's this little light and and
7:44money sigma e30 to this is the white one from their material their Theory you
7:49lunch as someone our brow bone it's a mad light bone white highlight now we're
7:55going to go in with a sophie 345 you guys know about coming over to make a
8:01geek bitten estetica that's going to increase area just really just go right
8:06in start carbon crease and we're gonna go right above our creatures a little
8:13bit above it
8:14see that they're going with a 40 again and really tough out that bitten color
8:18we don't want to be too harsh and this is why it's so crucial to have a
8:22transition color down first so much easier it's blending out now that we
8:26have that transition ok
8:32bring it outwards as well i got my crown cramping
8:36well not only that color nice and blended we're gonna go in with the next
8:41general pencil in black bean that's a go right on top of our lid so i put a good
8:49around the center and i use my finger to rebut out the rest of it right up to the
8:55crease with this and the farther you go out the lighter you want to go on the
8:59pressure
9:00ok so we have that nice black sticky base down we're going to go in with
9:04being sugarpill love plus is this really dark deep red color and that one going
9:10to grab onto more fiji 15 it's just flat brush and really just press onto the
9:15black ok and having a black beast out first is going to really make that below
9:21that red color pop so much more keep packing arm right up to didn't
9:28ok now that we have that nice red base down go in a more fee and 443 now we're
9:33going to really start to bug out the edges of the black liner base with it
9:39okay to go right into their really focus on buffing out those corners and edges
9:46going to be a little bit tough to bust out but we really need to focus on
9:50having no hard lines
9:53keep just keep going and keep working with the color keep really focusing that
10:00left plus and buffing it outwards now let's go ahead with the e-40 is really
10:05buff out the edges even more they'll pack on more color if I notice it's it's
10:14missing some going a little bit past that black these so starting with
10:18something like that
10:21again the key with this look is really taking that time to bust out those edges
10:32make it look like it's not too harsh
10:35so now we're actually just give it more dimension to the I we're going to go in
10:38with the Anasazi a shadow called beauty mark which is like this deep plum purple
10:42brown that's sitting on the outer corner just kind of really married that black
10:45with that red ring really just press it in with little pencil brush
10:56and after you continue to blend blend blend blend blend you should get
11:01something like this I was grabbing a clean brush really blending out those
11:05edges and wanted to any harsh lines awesome so it's going to bottom now
11:10we're gonna grab that same Nicks black jumbo aunt flo letting me run around
11:16that underneath the eye
11:17you don't need me without going to grab that same 32 and really just buff out
11:27that black blend it outwards now we're going with sugar another triple shadow
11:35in the color adoring to this nice green pastel green color patty 32 gonna run
11:40the right on black right on top of them
11:47grab any clean brush and dust underneath that to give you a nice diffuse
11:56transition we don't any hard lines just start to look something like that for a
12:03little cute extra adding we're going to make a geek utopia pigment on the sigma
12:08e 21 as our inner corner highlight have a little bit more if you think it's
12:14necessary
12:15yeah okay article finished by off-camera quick and i'll be right back

1:39let's get into this one brand tutorial with Urban Decay i'm so excited to be
1:43doing this
1:44I haven't done one brand in a while that's what i did was totally believe
1:47first things first I'm gonna take the Urban Decay v6 setting spray but it's
1:50also like a priming spray and spray that all of the face
1:53I've heard great things about this is great
1:57I thought I had the d slick primer I don't know where the fuck I put it
2:02no idea i know i have it somewhere but I just lost track of all my shit I have no
2:06idea where I put it
2:07so as for now we're going to use this key success rate cool for foundation I'm
2:11gonna be going in with the naked skin a wait list in the shade 3.5 i'm actually
2:14not the biggest biggest fan of this foundation on my skin type tons of
2:18people are obsessed with this foundation and I know why it's absolutely beautiful
2:21on the skin
2:23however because I have more on the early side it doesn't seem to really like
2:26working in my favor
2:28I don't want no I'm taking on more feet and 4 39 and start buffing that into the
2:31skin
2:32give me a nice even coverage this is a really beautiful foundation i think it
2:35looks so so pretty
2:37however my school it is such a lightweight like watery consistency is a
2:43nice just like medium coverage and this is definitely a foundation for more
2:45people that are a combination normal or dry i think perfect the base is on and i
2:50think it looks pretty looks pretty good
2:52I think the base is very beautiful so now that is i'm going to be mixing a V
2:55weightless concealer with the cleric correcting fluid in the pink one
3:00someone take first the actual concealer party that's gonna go right underneath
3:04my eye like right about yeah do that
3:08oh my god so this is what it's like to have more of a new one okay although i
3:11have this fucking dingy living here here here knows a little bit highlighted to
3:18fail and seeing the color corrector the pink why I'm still here right underneath
3:21here a little bit not too much really just what kind of bringing the whole
3:24thing in terms of looks fucking white which how things are going to get there
3:30and
3:30I'm gonna take a damp Beauty Blender and start to blend all that out then blend
3:35into the foundation
3:37I am so beyond obsessed with this concealer you guys this is one of the
3:40best can see there's I've ever tried ever and that's like saying a lot
3:44because I've tried a lot of concealers this could actually be the best I've
3:46ever tried this one and like the mac pro longwear and the it
3:50bye-bye under i believe it's called bandra awesome so now we have all the
3:53highlight blended together i'm going to set it really quickly
3:57I'm i said it with this medium light powder biomedical obviously this is like
4:01a face powder but he's underneath my eyes to set what's going on because it's
4:05all that on the morphe 48
4:07I'm the type of person that if I don't set my concealer increases increases
4:11like gnarly like not normal creasing like I'm talking craters
4:16I'm talking creators so just going to set it basically everyone i put the
4:20concealer i'm going to set with this powder as well and then for the rest of
4:23the face I'm gonna be taking it is HD powder Byron ok this is there naked
4:27medium light on a big power brushes of the 41 by Murphy and I'm going to run
4:32all over the rest of the face I didn't put that lighter complexion powder just
4:37so i can set everything in place
4:38I definitely need to set this face because it will move so much
4:44this foundation powder HD powder by urban it's so nice it's the most
4:48silkiest like lightweight beautiful powder like every project I told me
4:52about a while back and then after he talked about is when i started using it
4:55and I honestly haven't stopped by bring it to like all my events with me like I
4:58where all the time it's all good
5:00it's such a lightweight beautiful HD powder like it says what it is and you
5:04like such a smooth like application and appearance look at my face
5:07come on smooth ok now we're going to bronze up the skin I'm gonna take the
5:12Urban Decay beach the bronzer in the shape bronze this is like they're darker
5:16bronzer this color
5:19basically I was trying to get a life and dimension back to the face on the morphe
5:22- great just kind of powder brush to bronze up the skin
5:26I like to interchange between this one and the five to seven and i believe it's
5:29called
5:29I don't have a contour color by urban so we're going to do is going to make it
5:34work with this i know i'm doing a one regulatory with urban decay
5:37I definitely want to get towards like summer ending bronzy and like just
5:42and pretty you know what it means that's kind of what I'm going forward with the
5:44skin and this bronzer is so beautiful
5:47I'm looking like I'm having some color come on miami son
5:51give it to me to give myself more of a cleaner appearance but just like its
5:54kind of muddy on the bottom here
5:56I to have like more of a clean contour line I'm gonna take that same be 48 and
5:59that same powder that we used earlier and you have to kind of clean underneath
6:03the bronzer to get more of a sharp appearance just like this to the already
6:08just makes us different like it looks sharper and more defined it's not like
6:12it's dramatic when i click on there anything i just made some nice just
6:14subtle little difference like nothing too crazy
6:17another bronze to fail I'm gonna be taking the fetish blush on the morphe
6:21three
6:22this is like a really pretty mabi blush start brushing it onto the skin it's
6:27like a pretty much of color can see that it's free and it's highly the skin i'm
6:34gonna go ahead and take a two-hour powder blush in the shade sin you guys
6:38this highlighter is one of those pumpkin one's ever really good things about it
6:42actually haven't tried to get my first time trying on more feet
6:45I'm not more p310 let us see how this works
6:48oh she hey is me in my light
6:53it's only popping highlight for sure oh my god bless afraid of this highlight
6:58right now I think the blushes like home
7:00not me you know and let's go to move on to the eye area
7:05okay great so for the brows what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be taking it
7:07be a brow beater micro-fine brow pencil
7:11ok in the shade dark I'm just gonna run up to browse all right to do my brows
7:14honestly like to start from the bottom of the brow feather backwards
7:18I like to keep most of the product on the bottom part of my brow rather than
7:23the top like to have more of a clean line down here like this we have a nice
7:26just really defined brow line now and then we're going to fill it in
7:30naturally just very very very lightly nothing too heavy and now want to have
7:35the desired thickness of the brow
7:37i'm going to be taking route camera which is a little basically tinted brow
7:41gel and run that through the brow
7:43it's a tamer it's about Taylor came the brows digging this broad timber those
7:49no the brows I privatized already i just took the urban a concealer the negative
7:53way this one on my eyes I should use the freaking the actual eye primer Medicaid
7:57it's so good primer potion
7:58can I may be thinking a lot of the single shadows by urban decay which are
8:02absolutely amazing
8:04they have a beautiful shadows the single shadows and i really do think they're
8:07very very pigmented very nice
8:09I'm i combined riff and ABC gum which is like this vanilla shade and a sec orangi
8:13muted shade and that's gonna be like are basically our transition crease color
8:16and sit on the morphe 27 code many of you wait for ten percent off Lou
8:20shameless plug and morphe brushes . com
8:23and in store I love that brand I love that brand so much
8:27I'm taking actually a little more of the riff shade which is that like burnt
8:31orange a muted color
8:32oh my i did kind of bronzy because my face I feel like is more on the bronzy
8:36glow sign all the same thing for the highest i want like the whole look to be
8:39very very cohesive now have this is really just muted orange shade down now
8:44but this single shadow in the back which is like more of a dark cool toned brown
8:49and actually go on the most outer corner just to give me some more definition and
8:51dimension on a morphine and 433 a very pretty cool tone brown eyed people use
8:56for the brows
8:56I can see someone using this on the browse for sure
9:00let it out with the same he 27 with no additional part just to make sure it's a
9:03nice blend so now i'm going to do is I'm going to take the shade x which is I
9:07really cool golden peach duochrome shade
9:11absolutely stunning are you joking me
9:14this is like everything and then I mix it with the shadow called cosmic which
9:18is like a very glittery white shade
9:21I just like mixing these two combined will give me a really cool intense like
9:24glowy look and I'm just gonna go for it
9:26take it on my finger first time taking X on making your first and just going to

10:13with that wrist shadow
10:15I'm gonna take it on a 36 and run underneath my lower lash line to start
10:18to really mesh together the top and the bottom of the lash line
10:22I just want to make sure everything is very cohesive taking it about like two
10:25thirds of the way in because the eye is very very more on the neutral site i
10:29want to take a little bit of a pop of color and I grabbed the 24-7 glide on
10:32pencil in the shade abyss which is a good a glittery blue shade i believe I'm
10:37gonna run that in the water lining my eyes are watering to take a bitch give
10:45me a little pop of something a little pop color so I have a couple of glitter

10:58like the people go better with the blue in a minor so I do pink
11:03haha ok I'm gonna bring the K heavy metal glitter in junk shell that sounds
11:09disgusting but I live for it

11:20them both i don't i don't know what i would do that
11:22add a small amount of the gold a little bit further in
11:25okay great so you have something like this just a nice little pop of glitter

1:08guys later
1:09right so let's go ahead and get this bitch star kid
1:12ok first things first have obviously had my foundation and I might like based on
1:16my highlight and contour done i'm just going to focus on the island today
1:19because i like is more on the internet site so i figured i was saying time you
1:22guys are interested in seeing my full face like routine i link my last
1:26property tutorial down below if you guys are interested in that shit so you can
1:29see like what i did my face go so now first things first we're going to prime
1:34my eyelids are going to use the mac prolongwear concealer as our primary
1:37uses printer quite often I just like it because it cancels out any darkness and
1:41render some I had when I said it was some powder it just it doesn't crease on
1:44me
1:44alas all day i really like it and I'm gonna go ahead and set it with a very
1:48light just translucent powder I just wanted to be able to be blended into a
1:51little bit easier so i'm just using the translucent powder music Laura Mercier
1:54translucent I'm actually pretty excited to do today's video because I have a
1:57plan to do a cool tone is like my plan I have a plan to do a cool tone so I'm
2:01like yes I can do this and I do warm tones all the time try to be brave into
2:04cool tones so this is my color palette scheme for today that it's very cool too
2:08i think it's really pretty
2:09I think that work out pretty well so which means some luck mama needs it so
2:14first things first we're going to start with the sigma e40 and going with
2:18peaches and cream and
2:19that's going to increase this is my makeup geek it's my favorite transition
2:22shade of all time
2:23it's just a great shape because it's very neutral it's not too warm soft cool
2:26because we advise transitions got my shadows can blend into them way easier
2:30than if I could without it
2:32that makes sense making shadows are my favorites house like all time basically
2:36like I said we're together so what's so good and they're only six but like I
2:40just basically me like they slay me hard i'm gonna go ahead and take a more feet
2:44and 43 and I'm gonna take a little bit of barcelona beach that's going to go
2:47into increases well i'm going to kind of mix it in with that beaches and cream I
2:50want to be a little more cool tone and this partial on beach is a very cool
2:53tone neutral brown i'm gonna go ahead and put that to the crease and blend
2:58that into the cranial Angela Sun so now i'm actually gonna go in with dusty rose
3:04by Anasazi beverly hills and that is also going to increase with morphine for
3:0833 and this is going to really help bring that cool tone in a single right
3:11into the crease with it
3:17take it all the way into the front of the crease go back in with missing money
3:2140 and blend that how we don't want our transitions you know letting out wasnt
3:25it 40 is just it's so crucial to me and I do this all the time because know
3:29you're watching channel you guys feel what I'm feeling you feel in it let me
3:33being cool toned feel proud though before I forget I'm gonna go ahead and
3:36grab on to use on associate black eyeshadow on a sophie 315 that i'm just
3:41going to toss onto my highlighted area so i'm actually not this is be brave
3:45we're gonna go in with the Duchess shadow by makeup geek very tiny baby
3:50amount of it fell off and i wanted to add a little more purple to it i think
3:53it's going to be pretty with a little buffer bonus to it that the corner and
3:56then taking it up very slightly into the crease and blending that out with an e
4:0140 it's gonna help bring this nice cool tone purpleness to the look and I think
4:04it looks so sick
4:06dr. of a little further in because they look sickening very light almost
4:12non-existent pressure it feels like you're not touching yourself you're
4:15doing a right to blend with that you 40 again she looks something like this nice
4:19little cool tone purpley grayish crease
4:23yeah i'm gonna go ahead and grab moondust shadow by naked geek and it's
4:27like a nice pretty chill bead took color what area are waiting on a more features
4:34team now we're going to press on to the lid is going to be our base shadow it's
4:38a very cool tone topi color now go in without and 43 and with no additional
4:42product actually kind of blend out the edges and then for like the sitting part
4:47i'm gonna take on another bogey hills shadow metal on my finger so that I'm
4:52not gonna run on my lid and it's looking out for intensity is that she is
4:55sickening I'm gonna take that on the lid and press that on over moondust just
5:02like shimmery intensiveness fuck man i was more one more one more
5:07I'm gonna take fix+ on that same g15 spray the bitch with things get it wet
5:12this nice intense metallic look I mean fucking cool tone for the first time
5:18like ever let me go crane was gonna take a little bit of metal in my inner corner
5:23as well give me that intense
5:26highlight we're gonna grab the am or PM 507 which like a little tiny baby tapir
5:31brushes don't kill and I go in with correct shadow by making a geek and I'm
5:35gonna run on the outer corner very lightly and nothing too intensely a
5:39little V I don't want to be too intense because i want to keep that purple like
5:44very prominent but i do want a little bit darker
5:46thank goodness for this little pointed brush but this shit is precise as hell
5:49and i'll go back in with it and for 33 and just kind of blend out that even
5:52more to have something like this
5:54the top of the lid I know me because I'm not a little pencil brush and I'm gonna
5:57grab makeup geek my beaches and cream and mix it in with dusty rose by Anasazi
6:02beverly hills and around underneath my lashline I'm really trying to get that
6:05nice greatest dusty rose color go in and then on a more precise morphine and 508
6:11which is a very tiny little bit of talked about this before it's great
6:13getting underneath the lash line i'm gonna take that same depth shadow i'm a
6:16geek and that was gonna run underneath my lashline very close to my last thing
6:20I wanted to be just a very subtle hint of purple putting the help i'm gonna go
6:24ahead and do something later I'm gonna grab the Kat Von D tattoo liner right
6:27now it's my favorite lining like I'm obsessed
6:29ok this is how obsessed with I'm obsessed with in the way of doing my
6:33wing then I fill it in with another liner I don't make sense like I do love
6:37this because it gives me the most precise wing and I think it's beautiful
6:39but when it dries it's like it dries shiny fish and I don't like that like

1:39video and subscribe to my channel if you aren't already but yeah let's go and get
1:43into this look okay great so let's go and start this tutorial i already have
1:49the face completely done like I just wanted to have the face out of the way
1:53you know the facings forever and I've been doing a lot of full face stuff
1:55recently so much you know what
1:56it's okay let's get back to the face today and the right
2:00so only using a couple shades because this is gonna be more of a natural look
2:02I only have four so it's going to start with this bad boy
2:06great huh I live with this weird thing
2:09ok so first thing we're going to go in with peach smoothie by making week I
2:13know it's different for me about using beaches and cream
2:15this is gonna be a little more on the natural side i really don't need to do
2:18like a transition or anything like that
2:19finding morphy 27 brush right now this is like basically my favorite like
2:22fluffy blending brush this reminds me look at me 40 x sigma but a little bit
2:26softer so that's why I like it so much
2:27that's just gonna go to the crease because this look is so gonna be on the
2:30natural side
2:31I'm not being me with this whatsoever i'm putting into the crease and then
2:34just kind of do what I want with it and I'm gonna take another one my favorites
2:38favorites from makeup geek it's called frappe it's this gorgeous neutral brown
2:43like I who I left my pay I can I love trapping and I don't really use on my
2:47channel lot but using more in real life but something is out on the outer corner
2:50and then running out to the little bit and concentrating on the outer corner
2:54and just keeping it out there as well as by the lash line and this is just to
2:57give it some more added dimension to look I'm not really doing anything I'm
3:00not doing too much anything crazy just getting a little more dimension so when
3:03you look at the I it gives you more of a WOW factor rather than just being a flat
3:07surface you know what i mean and for me special especially because I have kind
3:11of like hooded lids going on so I'm like let me just go ahead and not accentuate
3:14that thanks thanks love you so much
3:16basically the whole thing is like neutral and brown or something like that
3:19I'm gonna go in with I'm speechless by making because well it is just one of
3:23their new duochrome shades
3:25basically what it is like a gold that reflects peach I thought it would be
3:28such an easy fun way to incorporate a little bit of color on the lid but not
3:31too much because i want to keep more of the natural science going to place a
3:33little bit almost like on the inner corner at the inner third of my eye
3:35using my finger to just kind of blend that peach lip shade out
3:39oh it's so cute machine put on the whole lid because i think it's actually really
3:43really pretty
3:44I haven't used to get something like shocked I who tell me that's not cute as
3:48fuck and 43 again just kind of putting out those edges a little bit of blend in
3:52again we're not being too neat so now we're going with am or PM 508 which is a
3:56small little smudge brush is very flat like that and then I'm gonna take
3:59corrupt make it because well it's just going to be a little bit of black shadow
4:03I'm taking a very small baby amount of it i'm just going closest to the lash
4:07line with that because I'm not gonna do I know what this whatever they want to
4:09keep it more than natural side but I want to keep a nice amount of definition
4:12of my lashes so i'm gonna do is i'm going to run that corrupt shadow along
4:16my lash line and even like bring it up a little bit over here
4:20make it look like a shadow
4:22just not very very very subtle smoked out like lash line at the top
4:27so now i'm going to take a little bit of the trade show lead liner by next time I
4:30put that on my waterline it's the brown one
4:32I actually really like this brown liner because it's like a gel liner go . a
4:36little coat of mascara I'm gonna take my roller lash by benefit my favorite
4:38mascara and I put a little code of that on my lashes
4:42while the curl just do a quick little coverage the cute little coat a little
4:46mascara focus on me
4:48lean on me playing in a strong but i'll be afraid so
4:57so now that we have the eyes done already have mascara on top and the
5:00bottom i use the glass for the bottom as always you guys already know I don't
5:03want to show you guys because they're just feel like you know I'm gonna take
5:05the new balance and flashes in the style
5:08serengeti which is a different style for me i'm not using Bellamy know you guys
5:11proud this is like more of a flare like a wispy pair they have a couple of
5:14shooting out past like the original length
5:17I don't know how to explain them feels like they have a lot of layers just why
5:23don't you just don't stick okay let's find some sticks at school no like this
5:27there's this really cool intense like spidery effect that spidery but they
5:30actually look really really cool
5:32I think they look super super super badass what you think also about some
5:36I'm an affiliate you can save twenty percent off with a good man anyway
5:39that's a really cool affiliate program i think they're the they're one of my
5:42favorite failure to be part of because they actually take care of the customers
5:44on like a lot of the other last brands I've like worked with him like yo hook
5:48it up for my piece and they really do and I really appreciate that about them
5:51obviously the eyes r feeney that means they are done in a different language
5:56I'm like so everyone out towards chicken - yeah i am living for these lashes
6:01though like actually living breathing dying for them and see if they're even
6:04there
6:06I see what i'm going to do
6:10explain it
6:13perfect so we have our face completely done I'm going to the lips now i really
6:17want to go with a more fall intense lip because you guys had requested that so
6:20now I'm going to do I'm going to go in with first colour-pop lippie pencil in
6:25the shade poison thing is one of the newest collection is actually i'm not
6:28quite quite sure i think i'm a ruin our burning shade it's a very warm
6:33honestly like I don't mean I can't even get over the fact that the clip art
6:36pencils are so smooth and so good and they're only like five bucks
6:39you're not your mouth of the baboon's ass hole looking good
6:42so now that we have our lips lip line i'm gonna go ahead and with Heather's by
6:46Anasazi Beverly Hills is one of my favorite liquid lipsticks that they've
6:49ever done I think it's absolutely stunning and I think it's just good on
6:52literally every skin tone as long as you're confident wearing the shade you
6:55can pull it off I promise you like anyone can pull this color off its
6:58stunning

7:00in gleam which is like the more pinky version and we take that on a and x 10
7:06what news I don't I don't know we're going to take a little bit of mimosa and
7:12crushed pearls and we have that on the cheekbones
7:16just give us a nice pretty picky glow I honestly don't even know why i will make
7:20us both when I overdraw like a mother
7:21bugger but why do i do that i don't know i don't know taking the laura mercier
7:26translucent again on a little powder brush
7:29I'm just gonna go ahead and do a little bit of cooking underneath that quantum
7:34ah wait a couple of thinking and then just gonna brush it away
7:37ok cool so now that is time for the eyes I wanted to a very pretty like subtle
7:42when designing shit shit what I want to do i don't know i'm gonna go with it i'm
7:46just gonna grab the palette I want to use I'm gonna go with it I'm gonna be
7:49taking the naked 3 by remote cabin use cotton so freaking long actually this
7:54one's a brand new one that I'm in case I mean if they like custom made it will
7:58expand on it I think it's super super cool that they do that thank you guys
8:00are gonna k feel like it's so easy to create a very romantic and soft look
8:04using this palette so that's why we're going to go into a more feet we have
8:09been that i know and i'm going to be taking the shade limit which is a very
8:13pretty just neutral like dusty pink essentially and that is gonna go into
8:17the crease and decide then this shade is a very beautiful just pinky base color
8:24and I feel like that look so nice with the range of soft romantic look oh look
8:27at it already it's so pretty
8:29not just go all the way into the crease all the way in using window wiper
8:32motions just very softly just blending that out and then i'm going to be taking
8:37a more fiemme for 33 which looks like this is like the 217 from Mac do poor
8:43like a sigma e25 whatever you want to call it im gonna be taking the shade
8:46nooner with this color is a very dusty pink little bit deeper than living color
8:50was gonna be taking that into the currents of the well this was going to
8:54be going a little bit lower
8:56right now we're just deepening the crease a little bit more nothing to him
9:00I just want to give it more dimension
9:01I'm really just keeping it on the outer corner i'm not going in far as in that
9:05we keep on the outer corner and then just take the e 27 again and just blend
9:08out that a little bit
9:10isn't this looks so soft and so pretty like I just looks so beautiful like I
9:14just wanna like be romanticize right now I want to take a bitch on a date I want
9:18hey sometimes they often it is not something i say often
9:22I just want to be like the Daniel
9:24shipping up i'm gonna go ahead and take a m3 26 and the shade of strange
9:29essentially it's a white color it's a very just creamy beige color and I'm
9:33gonna put that on the brow bone to highlight the brow bone a little bit
9:36with not just a match shade and then taking a packing brush I'm gonna be
9:40taking the shape burn out which is the third shade from the pallets and go
9:44right here
9:44so very just like sadnie peach shade the peachy pink sheet I don't know what that
9:49on the lid they look on the eyes I feel like I want to really look pretty and
9:52natural and it's going to take that and just lightly run that over the lid
9:56I don't look so pretty and so like romantic it's very soft and like DNT you
9:59know I want to do a wing but I want to do like a shadow
10:02I'm going to take off your hat - yeah
10:06okay , taking more feat e-40 3 which is a very just flat defining brush it is a
10:12great brush for anything of the kind of detail work and I take the shape black
10:15heart which is the last shade in the palette is the darkest one is a good
10:19black with like reddish reflect in it essentially i'm gonna be putting that on
10:22the lash line to make it nice and like defined without being too harsh
10:28which is whatever you want to do
10:33it's like we're tight lining with a shadow instead of eyeliner so we kind of
10:37intimidated by doing eyeliner is a really easy way to incorporate darker
10:41eyeshadow without being too hardcore you know and I'm gonna take that whatever i
10:46have left on the brush and just going to run that out here
10:49yeah
10:54take a more 5036 just kind of let out the outer corner a little bit with no
10:59additional product just because I want to keep it really soft
11:02let's still defined at the same time ok so in this is that what you have so far
11:06tonight it's just easy shadow extension
11:09I'm gonna take a little bit of concealer and just kind of clean that up a little
11:13bit you don't have to do this that if you want to keep it just kind of smoky
11:16and like soft do it dude like do your thing but i personally make it a little
11:20bit more clean on the edges just because I like that kind of luck and then just
11:23go ahead and do the other eye
11:25anyway so that's how the guys are basically done like I am good i don't
11:29need to do anything else with them I think they look just fine and I call my
11:33eyelashes and mascara off camera as well so what I'm thinking is I wanted to do
11:37lashes I'm you can keep this look at just how it is you don't need your
11:40lashes whatsoever
11:41you want to keep it soft and romantic like you don't need to that but I do
11:45need to do that because i'm a lash girl
11:47I'm gonna be taking the house of lashes iconic lashes i think this would be a
11:50really pretty lashes with this look because i do have that really nice like
11:53shadowy winged effect going on so I think it lasts like this which is really
11:56nice and extended on the outer corner will be really pretty
11:59pilots bad both I wish I was the one online as perfect as it looks but it
12:04doesn't
12:05honestly like I don't know if I like the way iconic look on me I feel like on
12:08everyone else look freaking bomb but on me i don't i don't know what you think
12:15give me your honest opinion I just really think my eyes look a little wonky
12:18but i don't i don't know i don't know
12:20so let's go into the bottom lashline really quickly I'm going to do something
12:22very subtle miss Amy 43 brush and I'm gonna take em
12:26nooner and limit mixed that's gonna go on the lower lash line just give me some
12:30how-to definition on the outer corner
12:32I don't want to keep it just so completely bare down here I still want a
12:35little some some more te 18
12:38it's going to blend out that a little bit i'm going to take the mac NW + 20
12:44what's this when are you a mac studio , graphic pencil in the nude shade and see
12:4815 nw20 and jumped on the lower lash line just kind of awake in my eyes a
12:53little bit more mac mascara on the bottom lash line
12:56my favorite mascara forgot to mention I put a little bit of that strange color
13:00on the inner corner of my mind with that same
13:03morphy detail brush nickel to the eyes are done now I'm going to you guys into
13:08that I look like up close
13:09and yeah
13:14yeah
13:15cool so we know what the is going to move onto the lips and then we'll be

1:45yeah that's going to get into this full face great girl bunny look
1:56ok so it's gonna get started on today's video bare-faced nothing on my face
2:00right now I wanted to do a cool thing to do today because tons of you guys like
2:03what I do full face videos so you know what I'm listening I'm listening to you
2:06guys i love you guys and I'm listening
2:08ok so first things first we're going to prime we're going to use the makeup
2:11every step 1 equaliser in the smoothing at the moment this is literally like my
2:14favorite port filling smoothing primer out there i would say that this one and
2:19benefit Porefessional are like my favorites
2:21so for foundation for today's choice we're going to be going in with the
2:24coach and OH
2:25aqua foundation i just love this foundation it's so freaking a pretty
2:29gonna take two pumps
2:30maybe two and a half maybe three let's be greatly I'm in the shade 123 and
2:35gives you a very nice lightweight coverage but it's very buildable so I
2:38really do love this and so I like to put this around the face and then of course
2:41I'll conceal on the areas that need a little more help icon to make my eyes
2:44and whatnot so we're going to take this on a Beauty Blender and just put this
2:48into the skin
2:49okay so I need a little more help on the forehead because i am breaking out a
2:52little bit on the forehead right now i just have been on to take the Loreal
2:54infallible in the 103 and just put a little bit of that on the forehead and
2:58maybe a little on the nose as well because this foundation is definitely
3:01one of the luminous dewy side and i want to add a little bit more coverage with
3:05the lorry oh and a little more magnifying effect in the t-zone
3:08so let's go ahead and can feel I'm gonna take the Makeup Forever HD concealer and
3:12y 2 3 i'm not using concealer and a fucking minute so I'm excited is however
3:17not really no I use this again
3:19squeeze ok yes squeeze honey squeeze away actually squeezing is kind of
3:24nothing
3:25use my finger inside a little bit on the back of the head and he's not here
3:29oh yeah are you going
3:30you're way more than I feel like it more guests look at that squeeze finger on
3:35the sides of my nose a little this country goes such a long way I love it
3:39go ahead and start blending it away how have you guys been I feel like I'm not
3:43filmed in a little bit of a minute
3:45no I'm just kidding films like fucking yesterday and the day before that what
3:48the fuck my things i like this consumer because it is very hydrating it's not
3:51like a trying to do whatsoever and so therefore increases less than a drying
3:56consider what so I really do like that effect of this concealer not going to
3:59set your under eyes with the laura mercier translucent setting powder or
4:02whatever how do you guys like that works for you
4:04I personally just like this Laura Mercier translucent powder because it
4:07works so nicely from my skin type it really sets everything in place it's
4:11lightweight but it's still heavy it sounds weird but it really is like a
4:15lightweight heavy powder
4:16it really works at keeping the coils are baked keeping you from creasing
4:18everything you could possibly want from a powder
4:21this really does ensure that and i'm using this on an 848 buy morphine
4:24you guys I need to tell you guys a secret not even see gracious
4:27I just want what's happening so morphy is discontinuing their elite collection
4:33brushes
4:34I know I know I'm devastated tons of people were telling me on twitter
4:38they were like okay so the brushes you've been using on your YouTube like
4:42you're linking looks like i do link on my brushes that you is on my description
4:45bar like I'm always pretty good with linking everything
4:48they're like hey the brushes that you're using are not available more for any
4:51more like what you mean so I go on Murphy site and they're not there so I'm
4:55like play
4:56so then I text the owner Murphy and I'm like you know so I'm just curious like
5:00the Lee brushes and what's going on with them what's happening
5:02so when he first came out with the lead brushes they were supposed to be limited
5:05edition and because they are so freaking popular they end up becoming kind of
5:11permanent or like staying on a lot longer than they originally going to so
5:14that's kind of like the backstory of the brushes
5:15what's going on is that they're actually coming out with a different set of
5:19brushes very similar to the elites and they're taking away the elite so if you
5:23guys are wondering like why the brushes i have been using have not been on site
5:27has not been on the website is because all the brushes that are Jerry now are
5:29the last ones of the lead brushes if you like any of the brushes that are there
5:32get em while you can because they are on sale and they'll be gone soon
5:35so for now just bear with me with the brushes
5:37i'm using because the these the ones i have so until they send me the next
5:40batch of the new brushes are using i will be using those two I have them just
5:43how one man just like the kind of even the title of today's video is using the
5:47swamp Queen palette by baby girl and tart
5:50she's doing everything club with her she didn't have a tarp like that's so
5:54amazing being so congratulations Bonnie I i I'm so proud of you in

6:01beautiful
6:02I'm so so happy for you so I'm just gonna brought up the skin with sweet tea
6:05which is the bronzer in this palette on a more fee and five to seven which is
6:10still permanent on their site is like the mack do brush for the bronzer which
6:14turned into that a little bit
6:15oh its payment as fuck got it oh just a little bit off and then start wavin
6:21bronzing house color so this color is like a really warm
6:25terracotta brown with some gold shimmer to it
6:29it's very very very subtle it's not too intense but it just gives you a nice
6:32pretty bronzy color
6:34oh it is a beautiful beautiful color it's a little bit more on the like warm
6:38orange side of a bronzer but we are in summer so that's totally fine with me
6:41and I'm really into like warm orange browsers anyway it's actually funny
6:45because I get clock all the time on social media
6:47my bronzer being too warm for my skin brown like if I like it I like it bro
6:51feel like a fucking watch it
6:53it is this so-called like all these youtubers coming out with collaborations

7:01proud of all these youtubers clapping with different brands and not only just
7:04small Instagram brands but I huge brands like tar and like Nikki tutorial is

7:12so amazing to see these brands interesting to youtubers enough to want
7:17to collaborate with them and yes
7:18nikki jackson and Bonnie are all fucking huge youtubers and they're all the
7:22killing of the Queens of the game but still like the brand interested them
7:26enough they're not celebrities are not in movies you know I mean to endorse a
7:29product
7:30it's just so cool to see youtubers get this kind of like reaction and get these
7:33kind of opportunities even though they're just on youtube
7:36you know what i mean so it's just so cool to see that and I'm just very proud
7:39of everyone that's done club so far and too
7:41how they keep coming and I hope they're just as amazing as the ones that have
7:45been coming out
7:45i'm going to highlight the under-eye really quickly with my Marc Jacobs
7:47instant mark of course be 48 same brush I'm just going to highlight the under
7:52part of my eye and I'm also gonna take a little bit of that powder and run it
7:55underneath my bronzer to make it more of a clean sharper appearance
7:59it doesn't look so money in harsh you feel me and I was like a little bit of
8:03mac shade stir just contour a little bit underneath the bronzer on a new brush my
8:08morphe this is the g40 it looks really like a awesome contouring brush and I
8:12tried it once and I loved it so I'm gonna keep trying it
8:15see what I think about it and so is gonna dip into it barely not too much
8:19it's small and define but it like I feel like it was really like contour bitch
8:23out you know
8:24so let's go into our country a little bit yeah see I knew like I fucking knew
8:28this was going to be a bomb ass contour brush like I just knew it was gonna take
8:31a big fluffy brush and run over it the whole thing just make sure there's no
8:34harsh lines and edges to make everything a little soft and date here again
8:39of course I'm taking the blood shots in this palette this is the blush called
8:42does this thing really work and I think that's from her series on youtube like
8:46does this really work so i can take that money more 53 brush or any kind of blush
8:50brush that you want to use use that brush and I'm just going to lightly dust
8:54oh my god is painted was going to very lightly press and dust off
8:59it's like a pinky blush with some golden flecks in it goes into a light layer of
9:02this please tell me a little bit of a very pretty soft pink layer
9:07ok course we have the blush on now and let's go ahead and highlight because
9:11there's a highlighter this bag - it's called Gator wings
9:15that is the most perfect name for bunny I've ever heard it's so adorable get
9:19your wings
9:20so we're going to highlight with that color and i love the blush i think it's
9:22very very very pretty and it will be universally beautiful and so many
9:26different skin tones so I think they did an amazing job with that
9:29so it's one highlight a little bit i'm gonna take a more feet and 5 10 and I
9:33think honestly the whole type out this is one of the most excited for is the
9:35high later because it is absolutely stunning
9:38so freaking pigmented you need to be careful with this whore because it is
9:42intense
9:43put in the best way and i can just see like it just come on
9:50come on dude look at this highlighter like what the freak basically the
9:55champagne gold chain
9:56it's a very very very lightweight and it almost looks good but it can be white on
10:00some tones but it's a very just beautiful champagne gold has gold
10:04undertones in its own University studying on so many different skin tones
10:07so I think again
10:09such a beautiful highlighter it's a very intense like I love it was funny to like
10:14with highlighter
10:15I get a lot of hate on the amount of highlight I put on and like a lot of
10:18like people a lot of people say that like it doesn't look good on me and it
10:21emphasizes my texture and what not and it's like yo if I have texture which I
10:25do
10:26I'm a fucking do have big pores like whatever I have texture why why I avoid
10:31something if you have texture like who cares who cares like I used to be so
10:35insecure about my texture on my skin and I would want to avoid highlighter
10:38because I was so scared of what people would say because I do have like texture
10:41of my skin but now I'm like I live you do not give us a single solitary titty
10:46about what people say about my texture because i have texture and living with
10:50it
10:50who gives a shit if you want to wear a fucking pound of highlight on your face
10:53just do it doesn't matter what anyone is saying about your face your texture of
10:56your skin do it is what makes you happy if it makes you happy to it I went to
10:59worry about the highlighter and yes i have texture of my skin yes i have bumps
11:02on my face but I'm just like so please do you guys like it please we're headed
11:07uh-huh so ya don't the face I'm gonna go and finish off with the eyes now okay
11:11cool so we are back now my brows are done and my eyes are primed that's going
11:16it started with the eyes now i'm so excited to be doing this tutorial
11:20actually asked you guys on Twitter and snapchat we just wanted to see if you
11:23guys want to see more of a bold I dramatic look or a natural i love with
11:27the more bold lip I think it's literally like fifty two percent was bold
11:31I look and the rest was natural look I'm gonna just follow you guys are asking of
11:35me and I'm going to a bold dramatic i look with this power today
11:38so first things first we're gonna go in with natural peaches on a more feet 27
11:41rush just any kind of fluffy blending brush will work and i'm going to take
11:45this shade into the crease
11:47this is a very pretty and natural transition like peachy shade is Larry
11:51called natural peaches so that's what it is
11:54it's a natural peach transition
11:56so we're taking morphine and 43 which is very similar to the back to 17 to do for
11:59it
12:00absolutely love this but I literally have like seven of them they're so good
12:03you can always use a code me anyway and all caps to save on more fee
12:07I'm an orphan affiliate you guys probably know this by now you guys know
12:10me you guys know that they're just my favorite I i absolutely love more feat
12:13so I'm gonna take this brush and I'm gonna take a man cat on it which is a
12:17purple deep plum shade and that's going to go into my crease extremely extremely
12:23pigmented holy and that's just going to go into a crease all the way to the
12:28inner corner because this look is going to be more dramatic
12:30I'm not to get Marky 23 and blend out the top portion just make sure there's
12:33no harsh lines or edges I really just don't like harsh lines when blending
12:37I've been doing any I looks even if I'm supposed to have a harsh line
12:41I don't like it I'm actually taking it from the bottom of my lower lash line
12:44out because I'm gonna make this whole entire look pretty smoky
12:48so you should have something like this so far so now i'm going to go in with a
12:51I base
12:52I'm already primed about going with a different base i'm going to take the
12:55pure I polish base top coat in the shade caviar
12:58it's a very very like dark greenish gold shade and it's perfectly i want to go on
13:02my lid i want to take the shape
13:04sippy sippy which is a very deep mob brown but has tons of gold glitter in it
13:10so I think they'd be just perfect
13:12combined with these i'm going to take this pure I polish with this little pure
13:15applicator and put that on the lid close to the lash line and blend it out as
13:22well
13:23I was grabbing a fluffy brush and blending out the edges of the high
13:26polish taking more of that man cat shade i'm going to blend out the edges a
13:29little bit just to make sure everything is nice and blended and then we'll be
13:34going over that I base with sippy and I'm gonna take a little packing rush i'm
13:39just going to take the one that are already provided in this palette is just
13:42it's already here and we'll take the shape of a sippy sippy which is a very
13:44dark brown plum with basically like gold greenish or reflect clear in it and you
13:49have to be careful because this this shadow is pretty powdery only because it
13:54is a lot of glitter in it so it will pick up a lot so just be sure to really
13:57wipe off the brush when you're doing it dusted off with your finger and then pat
14:02on into patting motions right over the eyeshadow base that we used
14:10ok guys you have this is so far it's a very very very very intense smoky outer
14:16corner I what I did off camera acts like was trying to figure out how to like
14:19blend out the crease without getting too like blurred and blended together what I
14:24grabbed was dog man a little bit on and 43 and i blended right in between the
14:29darkest part of the purple and my skin tone just to give me some more life back
14:34into the list because everything was so cool to do starting to look a little
14:36more like black I punched me in the eye kind of thing and then it starts to
14:39happen had a little more work to look at it will literally save the look I swear
14:43to you it will
14:44I'm just got more feet and 42 to get a little packing brush and the shade big
14:48baby i'm gonna put on the brow bone just a little bit just give me a little bit
14:51of a brow lift right here
14:53definitely just be careful with that sippy sippy shade because it does have a
14:56lot of glitter in it and there will be a lot of follow if you aren't really
14:59paying attention
15:00I did get a lot of fallout when I was packing it on and it was kind of ruining
15:02my makeup so I like three like put on powder on my face
15:07just be careful with it's nothing i mean it's a glittery shade most glittering
15:09shades out fallout just a forewarning for you guys so we're going to just
15:13gonna keep blending out this crease to make sure that there's no harsh edges
15:16i wish i had more lid space man this is not another one more let's go into a
15:20wing
15:21I feel like a wing will also help as well to make something a little more
15:25cohesive and blended together
15:26so go ahead and doing whatever kind of thing you want to do if not i mean you
15:29don't have to of course of course you don't have to because it's just like if
15:31you guys want to but i do want to i'm going to take my Kat Von D trooper liner
15:36i'm going to create a wing from the bottom of the lash line out words like
15:39so what's going to dramatically in that ok
15:45just going to start filling that in one family as fuck
15:49ok cool so I'm gonna go ahead and finish off with the eyes now I'm going to the
15:52bottom of the i originally I was going to do man cat and keep it all clean and
15:57purple down here but because i feel like it all started going to mesh together
16:01with everything I had a lotta orange and warm , to bring it back to life
16:05I'm just going to continue on with the orange and warm tones underneath my lash
16:08line just to make sure we don't like clothes off anything and make it look -
16:11Mike black I kind of thing so i'm going to mix natural peaches and dog man again
16:17on my lower lashline I'm gonna bring that all the way in to make sure
16:22everything looks little bit more warm and alive
16:25I'll try my best to do like a cool tone look but honestly it's so easy to go
16:30from like a cool tone two dead in the second and a fucking second it's so fast
16:35ok cool so then I want to have a little bit as well just because we gotta do it
16:40we have to do it i'm going to take a more feet m three to six and i'm
16:44actually gonna take Gator wings with that in the inner corner just really
16:48give me some life back to the eye and waking everything up a little bit on the
16:53brow bone as well a very small amount so it's going to take a cream color liner
16:56in my waterline which of course you guys can do that would be so absolutely
17:00beautiful but because this is great girl as her palate and she's so bold and
17:04intense and really really cool imma take a bold water line color
17:07I'm gonna take the colour-pop crybaby the lavender pencil
17:11I don't put that in my waterline just give me to open the way luckily because
17:14it is a light baby lavender color it's still going to open my eyes but not be
17:18like the classic wider beige color
17:20I don't have been wanting to do some more fun incorporating some more fun
17:24colors so this is what I wanted to know so you can barely even tell that it's
17:27purple it just looks like a cool lighter color amazing to go and curl your lashes
17:31and apply some mascara and policies if you would like
17:34okay guys so this is what it looks like with the lashes and lighter and
17:37everything is on with mascara and everything they can turn out so freaking
17:41cool in its of sexual and like Smokey and very light come hither bitch or you
17:46die kind of thing so it looks like i'm going to you guys in to see what they
17:49look like up close
17:50yeah
17:53and
17:56and just for reference that the lashes i'm wearing our Russian at black Bayou
18:00about some and they have been my favorite lashes recently i just am so
18:04loving them so much and they felt they just go with every single look so that's
18:08why I don't like them

18:12graveyard girls colors that she did with tar this is in the shade
18:17texas toast I'm kind of nervous because I don't do close like this ever I don't
18:20like like those grazie purple tones on my lips understand they don't look good

2:47and welcome to my channel so let's get into this drugstore makeup look
2:58it's not going to get into this full face get ready with me a drugstore
3:02addition I'm so excited I'm done drugs for video and so freaking long and i
3:06have so many with always request me to do more drug store things so please get
3:10ready
3:11drugstore addition a blurry all these drugs are probably from me
3:14that's why we're going to using two day I'm gonna go in with first the Loreal
3:19magic Lumi primer and it's a really good illuminating primer it does give you a
3:24nice luminous finish to your foundation and i just noticed that I'm doing more
3:28of a mattifying foundation like the t-zone even with this primer
3:31i'm good to go to work today so i'll be pretty good perfection so i'm going to
3:35go in with the Maybelline matin pour this foundation in the shade 120 and
3:39that's gonna be my t-zone foundation and on about it and I'm gonna do something
3:44else on the rest of the face is because i have extra just for foundations I want
3:47to use them all and honestly like for me I don't know what it is about me but I
3:50don't want to do just one foundation on the face like that i always feel like
3:55such a mix freak with our nation's collective you you know if you like one
3:58foundation for one thing
4:00why not use another foundation for something else that you like in a
4:03different area so that's why i like to do something to the T zone is completely
4:06covered with a foundation and so now for the rest of the face i'm going with the
4:09lorio to match a looming cushion foundation which is such a good ass
4:14foundation it's absolutely stunning it just gives you such a beautiful like
4:17luminous like life like glow to the skin and it's a good nice coverage like
4:21medium coverage very buildable it's just awesome so does it suggest this one
4:24so you're more on the dry side to this is a great one I'm gonna go with more
4:28feet and 4 39 and literally just got soaked her up and we're gonna go in and
4:33start buffing this foundation all over the skin and I'm also taking you down
4:37the neck as well I don't like doing this or what so ever i'm taking a liquid on
4:41the neck hate it but just for the purpose of matching and not having to
4:44use another powder
4:45I'm just gonna take it down the neck for today ya he fucking so for concealer
4:51might take the Maybelline master conceal this is such a good concealer it's like
4:57freakishly behind i'm obsessed with it to be honest I'm she needs a little bit
5:01of that on my knees a little real techniques sponge to blend it out and
5:04amusing about taking sponge just like this take up being like throwing star
5:09no that's so cool such a pretty conceal its such a creamy full-coverage
5:13concealer like to recommend any to consider for the drugs with
5:16nice and full coverage creamy and it really does cover like what you need to
5:20get covered
5:21maybelline master conceal freakishly bomb and not for the sake of being a
5:25brighter I'm gonna take the Loreal magic Lumi pen which is like another listing
5:30of highlighting a little . i really do love this pendous works really nicely
5:33just so i kinda illuminate a little bit more
5:35I really want to do the five minute makeup challenge haven't seen tons of
5:38people do it recently about you Jeffrey and Nikki kind of like started the trend
5:42up again just because I've been saying it all over the place a little bit more
5:45and actually gonna be so fun to do you know what i mean so you guys have any
5:49suggestions of any other youtubers that you would like to see me do with the
5:52five minute makeup challenge with let a bitch know in the comment box below
5:55because that I rockin around but i think that we really really really fine you
6:00know it needs a little you guys would want to see me to that way and I think
6:03that'd be just such a fun
6:04that's a video i've never tried to do a makeup in five minutes I don't know man
6:07i feel like i would actually really did terribly but you never know
6:10and I want to come on practice or anything I'll be good until i actually
6:12have to do it at once that's all blended out nicely i'm gonna take the maybelline
6:16fit me powder in the shape 110 which is that the porcelain asked shade
6:19just to set the underlying powder this is such a nice finely milled powder and
6:23I remember you think I've been doing this one and i think i'm going to try
6:26that and so I tried it on my first drug store video and it turned out so nicely
6:29and I was like what
6:32on my morphe 48 amazing little pointed setting brush so good and for the rest
6:39of the face I'm gonna take this big daddy brush the 41 and labeling fit me
6:43matan poreless powder because i have two met I just have two of them
6:48the freaking bomb i wanted to buy in something you know what these are
6:50freaking bomb these powders are super super get their money studio fix powder
6:53by Mac but like a cheaper drugstore version of them out i just really like
6:57them
6:57this is the shade 130 and I'm gonna run that all over the face just to set the
7:00rest of the face lightly nothing too heavy just to give me a little bit more
7:04coverage as well as set the face for the rest of the day so I never tried this
7:08product i really want to try to on camera this is the Maybelline master
7:11contour palette
7:12ok this is like a nice like contour color blush highlighter todo todo in
7:16here is everything and take this on the morphe to the contour color and
7:20bronzing up the skin color is just going to be a nerve
7:26do you want
7:29you know what it fucking works it works it does what we need to do we need to
7:32bring up the skin and it brought up the skin that looks a little pinky that i
7:37can literally feel like the brown so it's a little pink
7:39yeah actually goes a little pinky but you know what we're gonna go with it you
7:42know what's cool about these powers over that they're actually very very
7:44pigmented like it really has good as pigmentation for sure
7:50also i'm using it in the shade medium has any suggestions for any good
7:53drugstore bronzers I would be really really cool
7:55he doesn't suggest me some that are high quality like good good drugstore
7:58bronzers that are not patchy the pigment in there nice and good luck sir roger's
8:03I would really love for you guys to suggest me some because i don't have a
8:06single job on sir
8:07not one not a single charge your browser and I'm like okay I'll just depending on
8:11this little master palette to to get me through it but it's not working out for
8:15you like it's not really like my clothes I usually like to go in with bronze or
8:19whatever but we're going to make it work because I am what unspookable bitch you
8:23can't clock me
8:24I think you really can but yeah so we're going to go in with the little blushes
8:28what - well like the bus is here
8:29well they don't you three just kinda just a little bit this looks really
8:32pigmented so be careful
8:34you want to a nice light flush of it nothing to him
8:37it's a nice like matte pink black just a nice pretty color
8:40mm thank you and because it's also there
8:43we're going to go in with a little highlighter as well this is the
8:46highlight number three color and everything down and more for you and 310
8:50fan brush just to highlight the skin
8:52she's here let's do it I haven't tried this highlighter you haven't read any of
8:57the power yet this is actually a really pretty
8:59glowy color it's nice
9:03oh yeah that is that that works for me oh hi
9:07cool we basically have the face completely done now this is what I'm
9:09gonna keep it and I don't really have any more like contouring color to
9:12contour my nose because i don't want to turn the fucking weird so this is what
9:15we're going to keep it to be a base at I like dr. now I feel like at this face
9:18looks nice as clean it looks pretty
9:21so we're going to go on to the eyes now the first things first we're going with
9:25the brows because the brows are pretty bad right now to grab products that have
9:29actually been using for a while
9:31now that things are going to mesh well together this but i just want to show
9:34you guys what they are
9:34I've been using the Maybelline brow drama crayon because i do have browser
9:38so i don't really need to do a lot of things I just kind of feel the min ago
9:40and the loreal brow stylist plumper which is such a good brow gel its to see
9:45amazing
9:46so I use the Maybelline thing I literally just right through my brow
9:48like this on the areas i have more sparseness this is in the shade and
9:53don't know
9:54and down on the darkest one and we're just going to push that through the brow
9:58anyone have any sparseness as you can see like all right just looks a lot more
10:02filled nice bar so that's kind of what i'm doing i was running through with
10:05this nice big ol crayon
10:07I was going to run a quick believe through my brother though because it is
10:10pretty harsh and then the loreal brow stylist plumper going to run that little
10:15bridge also this is a really good freakin browser for the from the
10:17drugstore it's honestly like impressive like I was genuinely impressed i first
10:21tried this I was a day
10:23ok and you give a little bit of color excuse me no real excuse the fucking
10:28edge and then I'm going to clean them up with a little bit of concealer
10:31underneath them to give them more of a sharper appearance and that's it for the
10:35out
10:35huh so I just found my Milania Luminoso blush really quickly let me just apply
10:40that because that's like my favorite drugstore blush of all time is just such
10:44a
10:44mmm mmm it's so beautiful and so bad now we're going to win the eyes and by the
10:51way are primed the eyes off of camera using Maybelline master concealers
10:55primer also clean up the brows as well just so I can have a base down
10:59first things first with the eyes i'm going with the mix single shadow in the
11:02shade so wait i use in my first short story i believe just a nice neutral
11:06transition shade on a more 5027 i'm just going to go into the crease just have a
11:12base color down first idea what I want to do with the eyes
11:14I don't want to be like that everyday average I don't want to be slightly more
11:18dramatic
11:18so this is a nice really neutral buildable maple brown and i love it
11:22the battery got all that drama computer
11:24that transfer shit so that is why the computers on and now i'm going with my
11:29favorite favorite drugstore shadow formula of all time it is the Loreal
11:35infallible shadows
11:36after i tried the amber rush color and I did my last tutorial i went out about
11:40three but because I was like you gotta be joking me because they're so good
11:45so now I'm going today with the shade and bronze taupe such a beautiful creamy
11:48buttery consistency
11:50it's literally like a foil shadow from the drugstore its ID
11:54I don't know how well did it's just such a beautiful consistency and I was going
11:58to go on top of my lid just put this nice bronzy taupe color on the lid with
12:02your finger suck
12:04come on come on I'm shaking this little cleanup morphe brush which is the e28
12:09letting out the edges so there's no hard lines
12:13how do we know what I want to do like I just like feel like I'm in like this
12:15weird like I just want to know everything
12:18great now we have this is just told me top of the high part i want to go on
12:22with this next white liquid liner
12:24I just kind of wanted to try doing more of a cool different liner
12:28I want this look to be different I feel like I've been kind of inner not enough
12:31fun but i feel like i've been really into like pinks and neutrals recently so
12:35I just want to kind of jump out of my comfort zone and do something that's
12:37more fun and so we're going with this when the good liner and create a wing
12:41with it
12:45and fill it in so now we have the white eyeliner on
12:49I felt like it looks a little bit weird I think it was kind of a naked mole rap
12:53but it's because my eyeliner on and you're not emphasizing the last year so
12:58what you put lashes on it'll be so much better
13:00so the liquid liner by NYX you definitely like pile that one on the too
13:04late to three layers because it's not when it dries it's not as pigmented as a
13:07first goes onstage need to be aware of that and kind of cracks a little bit as
13:10well so just be aware that but I don't think it turned out really nicely
13:15honestly like I wanted something more bold look on the lower lash line so I'm
13:18going to take the next bot pop palette the switch chartreuse color and this man
13:22color is coming speaking to me so I want to use those who break them into this
13:26looks somehow somebody taking first Lee this shade right here on a just big
13:31fluffy brush this is an 18 more feet that's it on the lower lash line on the
13:34outside
13:35is that a pop of color like this though it's pretty so I'm going with this like
13:39really bright chartreuse color on the inner third of that I just to give it
13:43more of a bright like ombre effect it look pretty cool
13:45so don't take the next train surely liner in the shade black and I'm up with
13:49that on the water line gives you an idea or bright colors because i like to
13:51emphasize my lower lash line with a black eyeliner but I want my ice to get
13:55lost in like the white eyeliner or the color so that's kinda what i'm doing ok
13:59like this so far
14:00I'm doing in there and when you're doing a white eyeliner I feel like it's very
14:04very very important to put on lashes because you want to really define the
14:08lash line that it's going to kind of like kind of crazy have you been driving
14:11my real lashes for some falsies later on
14:13so from a scale already taking the Maybelline lash sensational mascara
14:16I've heard really really really great things about this one so I went out and
14:19body and it kind of reminds me of the roller lash benefit like applicator it
14:23looks looks similar to that play that on the lashes
14:26we have a mascara on now I'm not really sure if I like this one for the bottom
14:29lashes
14:30I feel like I was really do too much for me down there is any suggestions for a
14:34really good bottom lashline mascara from the drugstore
14:37let us know down there so now we're going with the lashes i'm going to take
14:40the lashes at serengeti my new found something that just give me a nice
14:43flared outlook and this is what you should have so far
14:45now tell me doesn't it with lashes look so much more natural and like it goes so
14:50much better together
14:51that's all I'm saying I'm telling you guys the lashes really make a huge
14:54difference at least emphasizing your own
14:56natural lashes when you're doing white liner and your lash lengthening and lost
14:59really really easily and your allies in general just get lost so with wearing
15:02lashes it's a really important part about this look this is what the little
15:05turn out to be and I think it turned out awesome huh
15:07millions of you guys in to see what that looks like up close
15:14so we have that face and we have the is done let's go ahead and finish off with
15:20the lippy or fat lips I'm gonna be taking the next week of the neutral lip
15:24liner
15:24this is a little heat huh it's embarrassing how much I've used this
15:28embarrassing if you guys have followed me since like the OG days back in the
15:32day you guys know makes people neutral lip liner I still use it like everyday
15:38it's just such a pretty neutral baby pink lip liner that works so well with
15:44any new lipstick and he knew anything i just love it perfect so we are not
15:48flying to perfection so now let's go in with a lipstick i honestly don't even
15:51know what I want to go into I want more
15:53no more peach I want to go I don't it's obviously got a bunch of the kate
15:58lipsticks by Rimmel London and I literally love this formula so much
16:02such a creamy beautiful consistency it's not like super opaque where it's like
16:05family crazy pigment right away
16:07it's just a really pretty creamy formula that I mean it sounds a lot of color to
16:11it but it's not like a mattifying lips it whatsoever it's a cream
16:14this is the shade 42 and i've been wearing this like crazy this month
16:18look at that look at that and it's not so good like I don't even know what this
16:24morning just want to go to me and this is the final look

5:34medium coverage concealer and the master
5:36and feels like a full pass coverage like
5:38heavy-duty bitch so I'm just going to
5:40mix them both hit me first pitch that
5:43motherfucker and then taking a very
5:44small amount as you can see right there

6:29lot for rent on the hook so now i'm
6:32going to take the RCA and no color
6:34powder this one is not really found out
6:36the drugstore but it's not very
6:37expensive it's like 13 bucks
6:38it's a very very very good inexpensive
6:40option for a great powder to set the
6:43face i'm used to bake underneath my
6:44highest taking on the world techniques
6:46sponge and just pressing that in a
6:48really ensuring a nice full coverage set

7:09the rest of things i'm gonna take me
7:10cody Eric spun powder this is found at
7:12most drugstores is literally like five
7:14dollars is absolutely amazing i remember
7:17the first time I ever saw cody is when I
7:18was watching a drag queen tutorial on
7:20youtube because i wanted to i had tried
7:23to drag before i got into makeup guy
7:24just letting you know it's such a random
7:26backstory
7:27I tried doing drag want with some
7:28friends and i will subtract tutorials
7:31and it was just it was not cute
7:34my look was not cute I'll try to find
7:36photos and insert them but I don't
7:38you're welcome because it's not going to
7:40be good so I put down our teeth brush
7:41and just press that in all over the face
7:43this powder smells like your grandma's
7:45room if you guys are wondering what this
7:47probably smells like it's insane
7:49I like the laura mercier translucent
7:50much more but if you're on a budget and
7:53you want something that's kind of
7:53similar and comparable the Cody our
7:57spine will be fantastic
7:58so now that i'm done pretty much cooking
8:00underneath these eyes looking pretty
8:02soon I'm gonna take the maybelline fit
8:05me powder in the shade 110 is like one
8:07of their lighter shades and I just that
8:09underneath the iso wipe off any of the
8:11excess powder and it's just gonna help
8:13to wipe off everything as well as kind
8:14of also brighten and then
8:15my eyes this is a face powder that gives
8:18you like a little bit of a face shine
8:20bitches struggling ok cool so now that

8:32the Loreal infallible Pro matte powder
8:35in the shade 300 which is the same shade

8:39all over the face just to kind of give
8:40me more of a skin-like appearance again
8:42to help dust off the excess Cody are
8:44spun powder that's not gonna make a big
8:46difference but it is more of a personal
8:47preference thing you can just leave it

12:40i am doing more drugstore look /
12:43affordable stuff i'm going to the browns
12:44on camera at least one maybe house off
12:46the camera though I did contour my nose

12:51smaller or whatever the fuck it looked
12:52you look bigger look smaller
12:54I don't know so now for the brow i'm
12:57going to be taking a pee
12:59loreal brow stylist definer which looks
13:02basically like it'd be a little honest
13:03arrow is adorable and we're going to be
13:06trying this out what she's this shade of
13:09dark brunette we're gonna be creating
13:11our little brow shape just like I
13:12normally would but any other provinces
13:14bottom of the brown first
13:16hey pretty good that's what is
13:18definitely pigment and you can see that
13:20i created a little button shape the rest
13:22of my brown that's too long
13:24honesty is not bad at all does not that
13:26at all to me how long does it last on
13:28the Browse off the day I have no idea
13:30i'm only doing this right now back into
13:32safe right now the experience that this
13:33goes on my sleeve pigment in its really
13:35really easy which I love and yeah it's
13:38not too bad
13:39let's go into our on the eyes now I'm
13:41primed on the eyes the only thing i will
13:42guys not affordable in this video entire
13:44video is the primary that i'm wearing on
13:46my eyes it's the Smashbox 24-hour when
13:48it comes to prime around the eyes that's
13:49like the one thing I'll not forfeit for
13:51like a lower-end one I just think that
13:53that one is the best and i can't really
13:56stop using it because i'm scared i want
13:57another one that was good you know so
13:59I'm decided that today I want to do a
14:01really cool purple focused look a
14:04dramatic one so I grabbed the morphe 35o
14:06palette which is the 35 per pod this is
14:09going to be great because it has
14:10literally every purple fucking shady i
14:12need ever and i want to focus everything
14:15on the lid color which is the infallible
14:17shadowed by L'Oreal and smoldering plum
14:19so we're going to be doing something on
14:21that lets go and start on with this I
14:23gonna be taking this transition shade or
14:25right here like a nice basically like
14:27peach smoothie looking transition in
14:29this is not anymore 5027 working with
14:31that into the crease very lightly and
14:34just press that in and just using little
14:36nice round circular motions to blend
14:38everything together the same our
14:39transition shade you guys on my status
14:41before about more people say it again
14:43some of these shades are a serious like
14:46bangers like they're so absolutely
14:47easy especially for the price . but some
14:49of them don't work as immediately as
14:51some other ones do so just understand
14:53you guys know that some of them off n
14:54nominal and some of them are good
14:56that's number one ok so just let you
14:59guys know I mean for modesty for a pilot
15:00for like what 25 bucks
15:02hey hold full palette that works very
15:04well trademarks that's pretty amazing to
15:06me i think so if you're looking for a
15:08nice pop and you look purple check out
15:10the 35 p because it works very well and
15:12it does have every clearly could
15:13possibly need as well as the nice
15:14transitions that you want in a pallet or
15:17just if you want a transition in general
15:18so I'm going with more precise brush the
15:20morphe e17 and that's going to go more
15:23concentrated into the crease really
15:25watching building that color up as
15:27another transition right on top of the
15:29new tape Casey right there two beautiful
15:31two beautiful color
15:33we're gonna take that out because we are
15:34going to be pretty dramatic with this
15:35look right there is no denying the fact
15:39that Moore has a good shadows like
15:40there's no denying it I don't you try
15:42talking about morphine say like it's
15:43chunky were at the end of the day you
15:45can literally swatch it put on your eyes
15:47and you'll see that they work if you
15:49know what you're doing the work
15:51no tea no shade to other shit talkers
15:52that can use my favorite shows your hand
15:55yeah i guess i'm just going in without
15:57you 27 and blending out those shades ok
16:01course we have a nice dusty pinkish
16:03purple thing going on right now let's go
16:05and focus on much more brighter purple
16:07and start to really build up that
16:08intensity ok now let's go in for even
16:11cooking without notice and reboot I'm
16:13thinking we're going to go in with this
16:15shade and this shade combine these two
16:17here and we're going to go ahead and
16:18start to the same thing built up that
16:20people into the crease nice just like
16:22dusty rose kind of thing going on but I
16:23really want to make sure that we have
16:24this purple moment going on because this
16:26look is going to be mostly purple this
16:28is a really cool to look for me it's a
16:29different okay fine whatever that
16:31actually lower than the other shades
16:33because this is going to be a great
16:34effect and blend out the 27 once more
16:36people so now i'm going to take a 36
16:39brush my morphine I'm gonna take this
16:40really pretty
16:41maroon burgundy shade right here it's a
16:43little darker it's much more warmer
16:45maroon brownish shade up with that
16:47lowest of all the colors and really
16:49start to build that up as well because
16:51i'm going to do a really dark lid i feel
16:53so I'm going to really make sure that it
16:54looks intense all the way over
16:56$OPERAND minutes and it's able to blend
16:57in easily into the next shades going up
16:59you can see I'm building right here and
17:01I'm really just looking up while doing
17:03this so i can see exactly where I want
17:05to place the product as you can see it's
17:08already starting to dig deep and darken
17:09up nicely same 317 blend out those edges
17:13again between each step I take that you
17:1517 and blend out one more time and now
17:17for the fun part we're going to go ahead
17:19and put on the lid color i'm taking a
17:22Maybelline 24-hour tattoo crayon and
17:25this is a lilac dust shade everybody
17:28going over with the Laurel shot on top
17:29just press it in i think this is would
17:31be a nice base color it is going to be a
17:33little bit lighter than the shadow or go
17:35in with but i don't know i just want I
17:37just saw it and I thought it would be
17:38nice for a base somewhere that crayon
17:41all over the lid wherever it is exposed
17:44and really have a nice pretty color down
17:47that's beautiful and i'm taking a more
17:495032 and blending out cream so it's not
17:52as intense looking it's not so like a
17:54line basically ok cool so now it's going
17:57to apply this L'Oreal infallible
17:58eyeshadow and shape smoldering plum this
18:00is the morbid dark shade it's almost
18:02black with like purple reflect on it
18:04waiting on a 32 my morphe same brush we
18:07just used to blend out those edges are
18:08just going to pack that on right on top
18:10of the base was a beautiful and it's
18:13really just start to build slowly and
18:15pat on so there's no major fallout
18:17smoking is not playing any games cause i
18:21love the color packed on exactly where
18:23we want it to we're gonna go ahead and
18:24blend out the edges of that color with
18:26that statement 36 you don't have any
18:28additional product we're just going to
18:29blend out that little harsh lion there's
18:32no harsh lines or any edges for this
18:35look we want to look really seamless and
18:37blend it out to perfection just keep on
18:40blending until we got online are
18:42actually have no hand is not have the
18:44top of the ice done this is basically
18:45what i want to have it i think they look
18:46really nice blend very well enough it
18:48looks blended on I'm gonna go back in
18:50without wet-and-wild highlighting powder
18:52really quickly the same one I used
18:54earlier on a small morphy am3 26 I'm
18:56going to pack that on the inner corner

19:33shades anyway so she does really matter
19:34so now going back in with a vibrant
19:36purple shade right there i'm going to be
19:38taking that money more 5043 really start
19:40to build up the intensity on the lower

19:52complement so many different kind of eye
19:54colors i just love it so much
19:56so when that really bright purple all
19:58the way in right story but the highlight
20:00because it is gonna be smoking all the
20:01way around now to really make sure
20:02everything is intense and smoky still
20:05we're going to take that darkest shade
20:06right here i'm going to put that closest
20:10to the lash line and really start to
20:12define the lower lashline really well to
20:14make sure it's really close to the lash
20:15line really pushing that in because of
20:19course closest election at the top is
20:21really dark as well and we're going to
20:22blend out with that you 36 make sure it
20:25doesn't look too hard place and now we
20:26have that down the go ahead and line up
20:28the waterline with this pencil by
20:30Maybelline is the Maybelline New York
20:31lasting and drama waterproof gel pencil
20:33in the shade polished em amethyst what
20:36the fuck in the shade and polish
20:38amethyst yeah so i'm going to put that
20:39on my waterline and just go ahead and
20:42brighten everything up because this is
20:44very bright intense looking for i think
20:46i'm attorney let's trade
20:47oh I just feel like because we are doing
20:49a purple look I wanted to keep it in
20:50that purple family that's pretty that's
20:52really pretty
20:53because I now we're gonna play some
20:54mascara advertisement for this is the
20:56new maybelline the falsies push-up angel
20:59then general oh this is very confusing
21:03doesn't want to see this
21:06okay well we're gonna try to help ok
21:08those lashes okay honestly I'm not mad
21:16this mascara at all
21:17it works pretty freaking well I have
21:19really bad lashes guide
21:20I i have laughed at that point straight
21:21down the short it's just not a cute look
21:24at this one I feel like because this the
21:26one is so tiny it really did help
21:28separate my lashes and push them upwards
21:30and notice a difference for real because
21:34you there was another mascara
21:35automatically apply some falsies I
21:37grabbed from I lower the vegas name
21:39lashes i got these at ulta and I figured
21:43I was gonna do a lash it's not as
21:44expensive as last night usually where i
21:46always wear like me glasses that are
21:47just a nice intense wispy pair but this
21:49is a great lash for not too much things
21:52like seven bucks and so we're gonna play
21:53the / on his eyes and that is it for the
21:57final i love this is what they look like
21:59what the lashes on things now that we
22:01have the face and the eyes completed i'm
22:04gonna go ahead and do the lips real
22:05quick and of course we're going to be
22:06taking a more affordable option lipstick
22:08as well so because my eye is really
22:11purple it's literally just you know it's
22:13purple right away i was going to go with
22:14the neutral and just keep it nude and
22:16move on but i really want to switch up
22:17the look and touch come out of my
22:19comfort zone a little bit and put a more
22:21dark nude on the lips
22:23so what I decided to go with his
22:24kathleenlights is at point zero lipstick
22:26also satin lip with color pop I've done
22:29this before and i love it so much it's a
22:31beautiful shape i think with this look
22:33going on it's neutral enough to work but
22:35it's still like not a nude as much if
22:38that makes any sense
22:39so we go ahead and apply this on the EDX
22:41I'm so cool tones like the coolest ever
22:43been and this is the final look and that

0:22as well i'm doing a series on my channel where I'm doing one brand tutorial i'm
0:25doing an entire look on just that one brand and I think it's been going really
0:29well so far and i love it and i think this will come out really really nice
0:32and it's all Kat Von D and kevin is one of my favorite brands like that is so
0:36that's before I think it's so awesome I think it's really cost efficient it's
0:39not super super super expensive but it's also really high quality but yeah this
0:42is what they came up with this is like a router smokey eye with a nice bold coral
0:47pink lip and I think about really nice is a great look for spring or summer
0:51you want to feel it a little more on the bold side but still wanted to be like
0:54still like glue and spring and summer mean you know Sam
0:57yeah that's what kind of video do not fucking watch it but yeah other than
1:03that I'll get you guys to the tutorial and I will catch you in my next video
1:07that's not true no see you guys soon
1:12okay okay so we're gonna start on to see all that yeah I don't know what that is
1:15or some other clean face
1:17i re-watched and I moisturize so we're good to go so it's going to head
1:21yeah i'm gonna start with the kat von d lock-it featherweight primer
1:25this is a water-based primer it is extremely like liquidy
1:29I've used it once before and it wasn't like anything amazing i wasn't like
1:33super shocked and amazed by it but it does feel super nice on the skin and now
1:41we're going to take the kat von d block information and the shape 48 light
1:45I think this is my color shape is literally shellac is fucking will go
1:53virtual my god it's really intense
1:55so I'm gonna take a little bit my finger is going to Pat it i'm going to be using
1:58a beauty blender with us because this is a very full coverage mattifying
2:02foundation and I want to share it out maybe slightly I don't want to look like
2:05Sherlock on my face
2:06I don't want to look too cakey and I think using a beauty blender with this
2:10foundation specifically really really really makes a huge huge difference
2:15huge difference to use the beauty wonder if it doesn't load it slightly
2:19not too much but like very slightly diluted it is full coverage
2:23this is not coffee face like if you were to put this bitch on it is not coming
2:27off your finger this is an amazing foundation for like an event or if
2:30you're going out like to the club and you get oily
2:33oh my god this bitch is not coming up even if you like dancing you're fucking
2:36booty popping and like grinding on some homes like this shit is not leaving
2:40literally take a little bit of ears on your neck a little bit i don't have it
2:44he how to hurt someone you can take this shit down my neck and I'm going to take
2:48the locket a concealer and light 16 which i think is the lightest color
2:52going to be a very tiny amount and i'm going to Pat it where I have the most
2:55amount of darkness and bring it out and then right away i'm going with the
2:59Beauty Blender
3:00this is a full-coverage concealer so you really really really want to go in quick
3:04to blend it out and to set it because it will increase if you do not set it will
3:08take a little bit on the lids two of two prime for the shadows are going with
3:11option to set it right away quickly and i'm going to be
3:13Kat Von D shade light with my favorite powder contour and highlight
3:19it of all time I'm take the light and shade on a more fee and 438 you guys
3:25know this better than an obsession
3:27I'm just set the under eye with it right away I like to just set it right away
3:30i'm not going to do the other eye was can see the first
3:32i'm setting the fish first and my life as well and then we'll go in with you
3:37can see that on the other side
3:38conceal conceal don't feel i just realized i lost and eat my earring
3:47holy shit
3:50ok problem partially solved that were concealed when you go back in with a
3:55more the g7 and the shade light palette we're gonna take that middle in the
3:59middle seen worse things that to bronze up to face i love this metal shape color
4:03because it's beautiful warm terracotta color like this foundation dries to a
4:06matte finish so you don't need to worry about like sitting at you really don't
4:10it's pretty sick that want to our car color and just blend into the skin it's
4:15so you have all the same thing on the cheeks have went a little heavy handed
4:23as you can see the palate is very pigmented i am absolutely obsessed
4:26yeah problems are gonna take a whiter shade when I put it in the center of the
4:30forehead to bring a little bit of lightness to the face in the center
4:33now i'm gonna take my makeup geek rounded blush brush and the
4:38he this shit right here is my favorite contouring brush you can take that at
4:41the base of my ear talking about your down to start bluffing bluffing that in
4:45and just really start buffing that into the skin
4:49it's a little more cool tone than the terracotta color that we were here first
4:51so yeah so yeah a little bit of the temples as well just give you a little
4:57bit more of a dainty full head which looks to me like this
5:01pretty easy huh so now i have a base down I'm gonna go into the eyes right
5:04now I'm actually gonna do my brows off camera because i don't think anybody has
5:07brow products yet so i'm going to quickly do eyebrows off camera and then
5:10i'll go into the eyes
5:11it is time for the I so i'm going to go ahead and take the monarch eyeshadow
5:15palette the orange one
5:16I cannot be obviously cases in the cavity to the ground you know this is
5:19just like my obsession of her pallets like this is one of my all-time favorite
5:23once I think it's so beautiful and so Universal interesting a little
5:26comfortable routine going to go ahead and we're going to look at that we're
5:29going to just take the bone china know what is that all over the brow bone area
5:33as well as the lid and she's going to kind of help highlight the brow bone as
5:37well as give us a kind of like a nice little base to start with you know and
5:40that i'm just doing that on a little more p.m.
5:42- oh nice going to get more fit for three and i'm gonna take that nice
5:45bright ask operate orange color is just a very small amount because the shadows
5:49are still think there's a little that I was gonna run in the crease very fucking
5:54lightly put this shit is orange and I really want to keep it focused on the
5:58outer corner that are left on the brush running it lightly in the crease and get
6:02out of the way and I'm gonna go into a sigma e40 and blend that out even more
6:07oh they blend so nicely to handle one today
6:11yeah it's looking pretty fucking easy I'm going to get a nice chocolate brown
6:15shade on the same for 33 and I'm gonna run that on the outer corner lower than
6:19I have that Warren chain
6:20I'm not just going to go into our lash line almost as well in our crease I'm
6:24sure to make a copy and outer V with this
6:26you want to be too neat i kinda wanted to be a little bit smoky and messy and
6:30i'm just going to take that and 43 and just go over the brown and the orange
6:34again with no additional product i'm just literally blending the two together
6:38p for t sigma and not
6:40again that's not going to take a sigma e30 pencil brush and that black shade
6:45the slightest amount of it because it is so pigmented like bitch I say this to
6:50maintain and i'm just going to roughly run it into the ground as well making a
6:55cute little V and then take a clean brush any commercial work i'm taking
6:59morphine 441 and blend all that together about the item me nice and neutral but
7:04still with a little pop of orange and warmth to it and she looks like this
7:07very neutral kind of outer smokey eye going on
7:11grab any kind of packing brush them to take this one by sophie and then I'm
7:14going to grab that same bone banana shade and you can take that on the lid
7:18the mobile is just going to help contour the I slightly and just bring some
7:21weight back into it like me
7:24so now i'm going to a wing we're going to take the trooper Kat Von D tattoo
7:28liner one of my favorite lines like ever
7:30it's so good it's so sharp you can do the most amazing with these and I is
7:34loveth
7:42boom swing down
7:46e so now we're going to get back into that palette for the bottom of the lash
7:49line
7:49take a little bit of the orange shade very little and mix it in with the
7:54chocolate brown we're gonna run that underneath the lash line close to the
7:57lash line and we don't want to be too into intense but i do want a little bit
8:00of definition down here and slightly further forward vary slightly but I want
8:03to most the most definition beyond the outer corner and then blend that out the
8:07little more food pencil brush very slightly
8:10so now i'm going to the other eye off camera as well as chrome eyelashes and I
8:13shall be right but ok good i brought my room down to several degrees and while i
8:19was in my other eye so thank goodness my eyes look like it's like an outer smokey
8:23eye or ng warmth
8:25you know my shit okay I'm going to go and apply some mascara now we're going
8:29to take the immortal lashed by Kat Von D I've actually never tried this message
8:32here before so it's trina everything else I've tried but not dangerous
8:36the one is fucking crazy shit is huge and notice right away is that it makes
8:41my lashes really skinny but it makes them really dark too so it's good to me
8:45that important to me because I apply false lashes anyway I just wish that it
8:47made my lashes a lot thicker like they're like benefit roller lash i
8:50really love that mascara but this one coat the bottom lashes tune carefully
8:55this bitch is so big like if you're into those huge ass once you're gonna be
9:00obsessed like you're gonna love this bitch but I like smaller ones for me
9:04because I'm just not careful with under I like I'm just gonna hire
9:08there we go mascara is on I'm sweating a damn
9:13so I'm going to take thinking of you lashes and style number one who has no
9:15style number one licking your lashes they just make me so weak they just make
9:21me so weak like they're just so beyond amazing
9:24not even kidding i'm like i'm worn these lashes like literally
9:28ten times don't give up on me a bitch to not give up on me yet I'm not ready
9:33perfect the lashes are on and the eyes are done something going to be guys in
9:36to see what the thighs look like up close
9:39gah me like to finish off the face ok so i do not have any blush when come on di
9:49know they have blushes
9:50I just forgot to go out and get one so we're gonna go ahead and take this
9:53second
9:54peachy pink gold color on aid morphy g5 organs ass blush loaded carefully
10:00because their shadows next to it
10:02ok no we're not gonna use that brush or going to use a more 509 which is like a
10:07tapered brush brush essentially and i'm going to load the brush up
10:11it's so pretty good pretty golden pink and why not use Shadow has a fucking
10:17flesh why not
10:17who said again i think im using his blush and highlight because it does like
10:21a machine
10:21I may or may not have gotten some of the great on my face that's what you get
10:24when you are trying to be resourceful and use a shadow as bullish but whatever
10:29it's not even that was also a lot
10:31we're almost done you guys will have lips left so I decided because I is kind
10:35of spooky but it's so more on the natural smoky side like it's not like
10:37freaking black everywhere you know i'm going to go ahead and take the jet free
10:41liquid lipstick
10:42it's just beautiful hot pink coral blue
10:48I hate / drawing with just enough of applicator and not having like a lip
10:52liner but I don't think happened he has a waiter at this bitch and ride on my
10:55lips like this color is still perfect for summer and spring it's like the most

1:11longwear concealer by Mac as our primary already put on my lids are nice and
1:15primed and I said it with the translucent powder is Grant's a primer
1:18because it has technology to increase and it kind of covers of all your let

1:25eyeshadow i use it all the time like always loved me
1:28ok cool so let's go into this purple smokey look because you guys wanting so
1:32we're going to start and we're going to go in with of course the target pal you

1:39go ahead and do that smoky ship first things first what we're going to do is
1:43we're going with the d40 x sigma of course because no my favorite thing in
1:46the world and we're going to go in with this shade and this shade and that's
1:51going to our transition shades so that means that we're going to put those down
1:53first and then the other clothes going to be blending into that ok that's going
1:57to increase I'm just gonna make everything a lot easier to blend out in
2:03the long run
2:04you don't need to be neat just toss that bitch and I'm gonna grab a flat brush
2:07like any kind of flat brush I'm going to go in with the lightest shade here we're
2:11going to put our problems are broad highlight yes brow bone now we're going
2:19to go in with a mixture of caregiver and best friend which of these two right
2:24here on the same me 4043 did right to both
2:29that's going to increase area a little bit lower than our transitions that we
2:40have a nice little transition color we have a little purple that's crazy but
2:43it's a little-known I am so now we got more feet and 43 just like my favorite
2:47morphe brush of all time and then we're going to go ahead and just go we're
2:53gonna just go in with this color right here and that's when go into our lower
2:56crease and its really blend it into the crease nice and softly keeping your eyes
3:03open for this you can see where you want the color to be deposited are going to
3:07get all the way in now going with e-40 again and just blend away any edges that
3:11I might not like with no additional product at all
3:15so now we're going with the fun part we're going to go in with bombshell
3:20which is this dark purple Clary hear that same morphe brush just get a good
3:26amount on like that that's off the excess and now we're going to place into
3:30our crease we're gonna put that in our outer corner first and then we're going
3:35to put into our crease and this is busy going to be our outline for smokey eye
3:40so we're going to go into the crease and outer corner right over that previous
3:45color
3:48then we go back in with a 40 and blend away the harsh like you can see a little
3:53harsh edge between my transition in the purple you want that to be almost
3:57completely diffused so now we're gonna go in with a morphine 320 any flat brush
4:06will work totally fine and then we're going with that bombshell color again
4:09right here loaded in and now we're going to hurry back on eyelid more densely
4:18towards the lash line and then we're getting up to the transition color I'm
4:21going a little bit softer that mytouch is a little bit softer because I want to
4:25be more diffused the higher we go
4:28so then we're gonna go ahead and grab that same morphine for 33 and with no
4:32additional product and blend the edges where my late color meets the transition
4:37color should look something like this so I'm gonna go in with a black eyeliner
4:42I'm going in with the LA girl very black eyeliner and that we're just focusing on
4:46the inner corner or in a room of our I smoking stock and then we're gonna go
4:52back in with that deep dark plum color on a sigma e 15 which is like those
4:57kinda the flat shader brushes and that we're gonna run by lash line very close
5:04to the lash line
5:07so now we're going to go back in to the palate we're going to dip into let me
5:12get a different 2 free spirit claret here and the one next to it and then
5:18we're gonna blend underneath that deep dark purple same brush we're going to go
5:23in with the lightest color and go underneath that
5:28yeah not so panicky like the last one huh like that we have this nice dark
5:34deep purple smokey and then just go and tell us a little bit more of the light
