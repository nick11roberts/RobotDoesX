let's do this I woke up like this literally I did so I don't make a cute butt like this is reality so all right so my eyes are already primed i use mac pro longwear concealer in the shade and w22 prime my eyelids and my eyes look so tiny today's and so puffy from my allergies I feel like I'm like the first color that I'm going to go in with is this one right here second down second from the left it is a nice warm kind of medium brown so I'm gonna be using that as my transition shade I'm taking out on and what it isn't e-40 brush from sigma this is one of my favorite brushes for blending ought to use it all the time I'm going to take this color and windshield wiper motions and i'm going to go all the way from ER corner to the inner corner you guessed it when I go with my transition color i always like to go back and forth and a straight line like this to kind of car out the crease and then once I've done that back and forth and then start going in really small circular motions back and forth because that will really take any harsh line and blend it upward into my brain and you can see better okay here we go Oh give me some now i'm going to go with the shade right here which is super similar to this one that we just went in with but this one is a little bit darker so it'll give us just a little bit more dimension and increase of our I this color reminds me so much of mac texture which is one of my favorite shades from a collection of my favorite of all time that's why i love this color so again to be the exact same thing i'm going to put this color in the crease of my eye and then once we have it carved out back and forth I will then start blending and circular small motions upward so now i'm going to go in with this color as well this color the shade and this one all are very similar which is like light medium and dark curr these two colors right here are literally such great do so for max saddle in that texture which are like one of my two favorite I shall I was ever so I love both of these shades and with all three of these colors i'm seriously doing the exact same process I'm not switching up anything with all three of these colors and just want to kind of pile them on top of each other because it just gives such a smooth blended look when you're done and just adds a lot of dimension as opposed to just going with one shade and buffing it out instead you have this palette filled with 28 different colors like why not use as my son as you can right now i'm going to be going with the shade right here which is just like the most beautiful chocolaty goodness color I'm going to pick that up on a what is this morphy and 503 I think this is just one of their new lennie rushes that can happen I love it going to continuously go back in and pack this on the outer crease and then work it upward and bring it in with the rest of the colors that we have in this upper crease area I love this brush then we'll do is go back with this color blue I'll go back with the same 44 should i started with you can take any of these three colors i'm going to take this one that reminds me of not texture and i'm going to go back in windshield wiper motions because this is a huge key in blending is just going over things especially once you've added dark shades going back in with a little bit of a lighter shade back and forth just to make sure that all of that is blended together and so we have no seems ok so now i'm going to go in with my favorite color in the palette and as this bad boy right here so taking that on this brush i'm just going to put it all over my entire lid and i am giving myself a lot of fallout right now and what I mean by that is i'm allowing a lot of shadow fall on my cheeks which i'm ok with I could go in with less product and i want to happen but I don't care if I'm not wearing foundation or anything yet so I'm just going to the generous amount of products and packing this on and then I'll clean up that under eye area in a minute what I will also do with my cotton rounds when I'm cleaning my under eyes I'll take it off fold them in half like this but we have a a line right here and then I will take back and I will follow up word and that will sharpen up that I look that we have going on it so i will just again take this folded and just go upward and then it will sharpen up that eyeshadow like so now to finish off the top one of our i am going to put a coat of mascara on my eyelashes and mascara will do for this because we're not going to make it look pretty we're trying to darken them so we can put false lashes on oh my goodness Georgie you can totally go in and apply false lashes right now but I'm just not wanting to apply false lashes yes I'm going to wash my face and then I will come back to my lashes towards the end I'm going to prime my face using Smashbox photo finish primer water which i've been loving recently so i'm going directly based on this i'm going to try the foundation okay i have not used this yet this is the new nars is called all day luminous weightless foundation gonna test this out how I like it me and bring you a little bit for this because you going to be all of my growth my foundation my hair's look so good today you guys going to use a Sigma f80 to apply the foundation and I know nothing about this foundation yet so I'm just going to see how it wears on my face and yes I know it looks like I'm painting on jaundice but look understand me i am not matching my foundation to my face if I did it would not look good i can promise you I match my foundation to my neck and a lot of people make comments about my foundation being too yellow but listen this is the call of my neck is so I'm going to match my neck to my face and when it all comes together it looks ok I've been excited to try this because it has the word luminous in it in the fact that is long wearing I'm looking forward to seeing how this where's throughout the day I'm not going to set my under eye area i'm going to use anastacio banana and mac pro emphasize and i'm going to make the mix those two together I cannot talk today i got up really early and I can talk a lot of sleep so just like don't want me as i set my under eye area with this highlighting powder i like to go up towards my temple because this will just give more they lifted appearance to the base I'm going to my under eye area now because I cannot stand seeing myself with like all the shadow of the top of my list of my under-eye totally like first I want to go ahead with a pencil brush just like this and i'm going to go in with really any of these three brown shade that we would initially I want to take this one right here i'm going to take this and go all along the lower lash line and because this is a very blown out rounded smokey eye I really am NOT going to focus on making this too perfect ok so now i'm going to take the e 15 from sigma the flax fibre brush I'm going to go back in with this chocolaty shade so everything even the top line we're not meeting on the bottom lid I'm going to do this color I'm going to press it really tight along my lower lash line I'm going to go back and blend out afterwards of course because every time i go of the dark shade have to go back and let it out way to go in with black eye kohl and this is the RNC in monster black eyeliner i mention this liner many times before is my favorite black eyeliner ever is so creamy and rich in pigment it's amazing so I'm going to line my entire water line top and bottom I was going to let that black I pulled just kind of sit there for a minute and i'm going to go in and do my eyebrows the way I've been filling in my brows recently as i start in the inner corner and I make a dark line all in the bottom part of my brow and then I just kind of flick upward and then that is it I haven't been doing much to the top of the ground I just start at the bottom and click upward and then that's all i've been going for a little bit more of a natural brow recently not natural whatsoever but just not as bold and used to fill the man now i'm going to be highlighting my brow bone and the inner corner of my eye and I'm going to be using this shade right here very first you the palate we're going to do is I'm going to take that color i'm just going to put it at the high point of the brow bone right here ok so now i'm going to apply false lashes i'm going to be using this brand I got in the mail and I don't have pronounced it crown milady I'm not quite sure i will sit down below course my description bar and they look like this and they are full and they're fluffy and their the luminous this is really going to give us a big extra on top lid I'm sorry but I just can't talk about applying false lashes like it just does not work this is one awkward by doing talk throughs because there's some things that I do that I can't talk through like applying my lashes I cannot talk about an appointment lashes I cannot talk when I'm doing eyeliner i do certain things I cannot open my mouth and I'm doing it because it's just like it throws me off I personally think that it's like a must to put mascara on your lashes look like this because we have such dark volume eyelashes on our top lid I really kind of want to match that replicated on the lower lash line as well otherwise your eyes , kind of squint easy now i'm going to contour my cheeks and i'm going to be using the Kat Von D shade light palette and I'm going to go in this middle color right here and i'm also using the brush that she sells for this kit as well i'm going to be using the contour and the brush and go in with that shape ok so this foundation is not working for me like at all it is sitting on top of my skin do you see how blotchy everything is it can't be this much work it because i have been loving this contour kit I don't know what to do to make this look better i'm going to apply blush i'm going to be using Mac margin which is when my kicker blushes ever I'm just going to buy that the apples of the cheeks and blend it backward then i'm going to highlight my cheekbones and i'm going to be kicking it old school with married women either by the ball i haven't used in so long I thought my baby today I wasn't why I love you what I'm going to go in and highlight the tops of my cheekbones with this for my lips I'm going to use my favorite nude lip combination ever which is the butter cream lipstick that i created with dr cosmetics all i just opened up a brand-new two bandits excel freshly yes i'm going to go over that make sure our cosmetics shimmer of hope lip gloss I'm just going to set this with urban occasion makeup setting spray because God knows we need it so we are all finished and this is the completed look right here and I honestly just have to talk about this because typically I would not mention this because i like to only talk about the positive here on my channel but because i tried this foundation on camera I feel like I'm just kind of obligated to give up my opinion and I'm just gonna be honest I'm really disappointed and hope is the point is foundation i think that makes sense I was so excited to try this because it says right here in the title of it said weightless aluminous long wearing foundation so I was like yes it is not making my skin luminous it honestly feels very dry out my skin it's cleaning and settling in every single little teeny tiny fine line I want to get up close in the mirror my skin actually looks kind of old it looks like i've never seen it before so I don't know and then when I went in with the power to contour this foundation look like grabbed onto the powder contour and i can not let you out so I feel a very blocky especially right here like I'm going to try to like it though i am going to try to mix it with oil and cream contour instead and maybe if i use it with creams maybe I like it better so we'll see well let me know how you guys do about this foundation in the comments down below if you try to I would love to know maybe those of you with oil your skin prefer it better because i am tried that could be a reason why it's cleaning so much to my skin and like everything on so let me know let me know if you guys have any tips or people like they're not and i will wear this for the rest of the day and in my opinion changes on I by the time of this video I will I'll put it down in the description bar i'll let you know if for some reason it starts looking like a beautiful of an hour from now i'll let you know so that's it thank you so much for watching this video i love you guys and I'll see you soon hey guys great things from my home to yours and come to my first holiday makeup to market oh I'll jokes aside i am so excited to be coming this video because i have not done a makeup tutorial like a fun one and quite a while so it's it was fun sitting down today coming to look for you and thank you so much to everyone who left me comments and tweeted me and gave me inspiration for this makeup tutorial i have seen it so many great suggestions for making books i am officially in the holiday spirit actually that's a total lie rewind not a holiday spirit but i'm in the makeup holiday look spirit you know what I mean still not ready to put the tree but I'm ready to beat my face and a lot of people were actually requesting warm smoky eyes like cranberry smokey eyes and or smoky eyes and incorporating ready now like you just come to mama like like a fiend like needs her fix when it comes to those warm smoky eyes but i actually saw one comment that asked for a olive green and gold smokey eye and it had like a couple hundred thumbs up and if i don't know if that home and just spoke to me and I was like yes I don't know if I've done a golden like an olive green sake I have it's definitely been a long time so I thought it was time to do one all green is one of my favorite colors like we're in clothing i absolutely love it especially like a dark dark forest green love it don't ask why are all my style is kind of weird can you hear my channel you'll get used to it promise and he fires in no time takes a minute to get used to me but we'll get there anyways all babbling inside this is the look that I came up with thank you so much for the suggestions you guys gave me because it's because of you that I come up with this look and I just absolutely love it I wanted to make it smoky bags and I want to make it like level 10 smoky because I feel like thanksgiving in the time to be drag queen status for me personally and you know that that's like a big thing is not always all about my Queens but Thanksgiving even though I want to do a smokey eye i like to keep it like a little bit more fresh than I would for something that New Year's e or even Christmas i did you can be an open top and glittery and fun but for thanksgiving it's like I'm spend the day with my family i'm eating the food i'm drinking good wine and so even though i wanted to do a smokey eye i did put a cream eyeliner on my waterline because I didn't want my eyes to look like too small to close in to smokey so if you're ever wondering why would apply a cream liner to your lower water line at the post leading it just completely blank it's because it will open up the eyes to make them look much more fresh awake and why so if you have small eyes to begin with it's a great tip to always put cream liner in there and will really make your eyes pop and so whenever I did the dark smoky eye and I want to really make sure that you can still see my eyeballs and not just the colors on my lid I will line my waterline I have a hard time talking to you Madeline Madeline I will win that will hold you going I'm done ok it's been a long day thank you so much for watching and stick around me I'm so excited for my upcoming makeup tutorials i have a list now thanks to you guys keep them coming know like sometimes I'll be waiting at all of this i want to this ones that don't make choices last minute so keep your request coming for anything you want to see during the holiday season and make sure to subscribe if you want to see any upcoming festive holiday look so thanks for watching guys I'll see you soon bye ok so today I'm going to be starting with my face is personal preference you can start with the skin eyes whatever you're comfortable with but today i want to start with my skin so i'm going to go in with the marc jacobs undercover coconut primer I really been loving this recently and then for foundation and concealer you're going to see the same routine that I've done in the past two videos because of the fact that i am moving to a new filming space right now my entire makeup collection is over there and I've been organizing it so i only have like the basic everyday essentials when it comes to my skin at my house right now so that's why you're seeing the exact same routine as the past two videos so i am mixing d cogiendo aqua foundation with the mac moisture SPF 15 5 station and then blending them together i'm going to be applying it with a tart face kabuki brush and then for my concealer i am using the of course urban decay weightless naked concealers and my favorite concealer ever and i actually oh my gosh using my Chicago accent come out I said he actually well anyways I actually ran out of my color in the middle of this video and that's why you see me using that lighter shade I am typically light/medium neutral and I ran out of it so you saw me just go in with the streetlight one I usually use that one to highlight so i put that on the forehead and the chin as well to balance out the under eye area if I apply a light considered to the under eye area i always want to even out by applying to the forehead and the chin as well to make it look a little bit more natural so now i'm just going to be setting my under eye area i am using the Anasazi of Beverly Hills banana powder and i'm going to lightly dust that in the entire under eye area so that nothing creases and then i'm going to be going in with one of my favorite eye shadows of all time and this is my mac and it's called an interrupted it is a pro longwear eyeshadow and i'm applying it with a more fee for 41 brush and just dustiness in my entire crease area i'm really going to hula hoop the entire upper lid of the eye all the way from inner corner to outer corner since we're going to be applying dark shades on both inner and outer corner today I want to make sure that we start by putting a nice color in that crease and blending upward as you can see this is not blending out perfectly it's a little choppy in the crease area which I was not happy with I want my crease to be a very blended I don't want any harsh lines I want nothing to be choppy so I did decide to go in with a little bit of makeup geek desert sands this is basically like an interrupted little sister it's very similar to the color it's just a little bit lighter and shape so I just grabbed that color and then i went over top of it and as you can see it begins to blend out much smoother if you ever have an issue with an eyeshadow not blending out it's always a great idea to grab just one shade lighter of the similar shade and go over it and then that will help blend out any harsh lines now i'm going to be going in with dirty martini eye shadow again by makeup geek I love this eyeshadow so much it is such a beautiful olive green color I could just throw this all over my lid and put on something liner and be satisfied so I'm now going in with the morphe and 443 brush this is one of my favorite blending brushes but as I got the inner corner of the eye I realized it was a little too fat for what I wanted to do you could make it work but because i had this brush i decided to go in with this one instead and this is the Sigma e45 it's just a much more small precision blending brush and it just fit that in her corner way better so again on the outer corner of the eye i will begin to pack that and kind of blend it upwards but more than anything we're just concentrating on really packing on that color so that it's nice and rich and then kind of blending it into the socket of the crease and then as we move forward I will trade out that morphe brush for the Sigma e45 to make sure that I get that color nice and precise on the inner corner you could use a q-tip for this and then you could blend it out with like the morphe blending brush you don't need to use both brushes but because i have them both I wanted to use them both because it made it easiest for me so now I'm grabbing that original brush and I'm going back in with mac on interrupted and i'm going to put that in the crease because we are working with this matt all of green we don't want it to get muddy and dirty looking so we're going to make sure that we continue to go back in with that original shade to keep that crease looking nice and warm and blend it out because we don't want to bring that all of green up too high so now we're going to go in with an even darker green and this is called enchanted forest oh my gosh this color is so gorgeous it's just a much darker version of the original all agree that we went with so using that same Sigma e45 I'm going to pack that mainly on the outer corner you can put on the inner corner if you want as well but i really wanted to concentrate on the outer corner and then again i will go in with a little bit more of an interrupted on the brush and blend that out we really want to keep the Greens low because if you bring them up too high on the lid that's when it can start to look like a little bit like a bruise and we know that a bruised is not cute on anybody so now we are going to be going in with a foiled eyeshadow by makeup geek and this is in the shade gesture and i have recently fallen in love with this color and it is a really beautiful olive green with some gold reflex and it and so I am using a mac 242 brush to apply this is a synthetic flat brush so any synthetic flat brush will work for this I'm going to focus his color mainly on the center of the lid and then blend it out to the sides and I'm initially going in with this drive i will spritz my brush and a moment with some mac fix+ if you don't have to explain you can use eye drops and that will work pretty much just the same i'm going to make sure I really focus that wet brush right on the center of the lid to get a really nice metallic sheen this is a great trick if you want to make your eyes look bigger and rounder so if you have small eyes this will be a great tip for you with any shadows any colors to really make sure you concentrate the color in the center of the eye and then I was taking a little bit more of that initial olive green and popping in the inner corner because I felt like gesture was kind of overpowering it and I didn't want to lose that inner corner depth darkness that we had now i'm going to fill in my brows basic we've seen this a million times before and I actually ran out of my color and the Anasazi a brow is right as i went to apply it and you know that moment we were just like no my brows shut a quick tier and move on so i'm actually using a color from my back stock that is not my right shade but we're just going to see past that right we can pass it was the look is done it's fine looks a little weird now but it'll be fine so I am using Mac nylon as my brow highlight today because this is my favorite brow highlight ever as like a nice yellow sheen to it and it is frosty as can be so at last you forever because the tiniest bit goes such a long way I'm going to put that right on the top of the brow bone of blend out a little bit we're going to move on to the lower lash line so I'm going initially with enchanted forest which is that super super dark green i'm going to apply that only on the outer half of the eye and now i'm going to do is I'm going to go in with the lighter green which is dirty martini and i'm going to put that on the inner half of my eye so it's almost like an ombre effect and we have the darker color and the outer corner because we did the same thing on the upper lid we put a chance of force that dark green on the outer and we left the inner corner with just dirty martini so I kind of wanted to have that same effects of kind of an ombre under eye and then using a pencil brush I'm going to grab a little bit of that mac and interrupted and just begin to blend it out because I never want harsh lines on the under eye area i always wanted to have the same effect as the upper lid so I like to make sure that it's really nice and smoky and blown out that's why we go in with a pencil brush and better color now i'm going to go in with the mac chromatographic pencil and NC 15 / nw20 which is just an amazing cream liner and it doesn't bother my eyes my eyes are very sensitive it's going to line my waterline to really make my eyes stand out especially since i have blue / green eyes my eye color can easily get lost with this makeup look so this trip this trick will make my eye color kind of stand out and not get lost with all the other green tones and I'm just popping a little bit of nylon highlight on the inner corner as well to match the brow bone because the interop highlight is something i can't skip and then i'm going to go in with the Laurier laurier laura mercier translucent setting powder and i'm going to be using an e3 brush from morphe just to dust this over my entire face this is a trick that I do to make my bronzer on my contour my blush and highlight just go on very very smooth so it's not patchy at all then I'm going to go in with all my gosh you guys these lashes these are the new lashes by the Lord lashes and they're sold exclusively at sephora and I actually think they're launching today but they sent them to me early and this is the style fluff in wispy a whole my gosh they are probably one of my face actually all my favorite lashes I've ever used before so i'll try to find it and link it down below for you guys if they are available in a very dramatic but they are amazing and I'm going to cut my lower lashes with some mascara i use mac extended play lash because my favorite lower lash mascara along with the room i lash accelerator and then i'm going to bronze my face using a bobby brown bronzer I believe this is a golden one golden light one maybe and i am using one of my favorite contour brushes at the moment this is the morphe 523 brush I don't know what was technically made for but i've been using it for contour i absolutely love it because it gives a really easy kind of soft contour much softer than like the NARS eat a brush which I love as well but this one I just feel like a softer and easier and not as harsh and I don't know I go through moments where I want really harsh contours and softer ones speaking of a harsh contour i'm going to take just a little bit of that laura mercier translucent powder and i'm going to use a really intense angled brush from morphe this is the 459 I'm gonna let that sit there for a few minutes i'm going to just dust it off and i have course and setting my brows using anastacio clear brow gel AKA browse super glue more like gorilla glue because this stuff does not move and then i'm going to go in with a blush from the morphine 9b palette i still love this palette guys it's so good i'm going to use this blush this coral and top right corner it has a little bit of Sheen in it but it's not sparkly or glittery i'm going to apply that to the apples of the cheeks and i'm going to really bring it backward towards the cheekbones recently I've been into applying blush a little bit further back I feel like it pulls the face back a little bit more than putting it just on the apples of the cheeks I'm thinking about doing an in-depth video about blush contour baking highlight so let me know if you guys want to see that video and i'll be happy to do it for you and i'm going to just dust off that bake that we had sitting there that sounds so funny oh my gosh help me and then i'm going to apply champagne pop to my cheekbones using a morphy m5a1 brush I get asked all the time of my favorite brushes for highlight and it's hands-down the m500 one I absolutely love it i've been using it for months and it is my fav and i am going over with a second highlight because I'm just feeling you know so I'll see today i'm gonna pop some on my cupid bow and then I'm going to take a little bit of that same bronzer used to contour and just shadow my lower lip just to give a little bit more of a lower fuller lip effects even though my top lip needs the fullness let's get real about my bottom but let's move on for lipstick i'm going to be using house of dollars pretty MF and as you can see it's like a really really light orange kind of cream sinkhole and I don't love the way this looks on my skin tone personally maybe I'm just not used to seeing myself in it but i wanted to go over to kind of manipulate the color a little bit so I'm going to go in with a NYX butter gloss this is an oldie but a goodie and the shade maple blondie and i feel like these two colors mixed together are just like my dream come true for a Thanksgiving lip I just think it looks like a creamsicle creamy pumpkin pie i just love the shade that these to make together and it's nice and glossy and i just love a glossy lip so after we have that we're just going to set everything by using Urban Decay to makeup setting spray we use any spray you want or you can just be balls do not use any setting spray all mad respect to you and that's the end so i hope you guys enjoy happy thanksgiving from my family to yours love you guys so much and I'll see you soon hey guys so for today's video this is the most random video that i have been a really long time i'm going to be doing a first impressions video on the new Carly cosmetics cumshot oh I catch that was very clever up because shadow bronze eyeshadow palette this is so random and unexpected I was not planning on doing this I've actually had such a busy day and it is currently eight almost a 38-28 right now and i decided to take a quick body shower and run over here and from this video for you guys because I received this package in the mail today this was sent to me from Kylie cosmetics just so you guys know i received this package in the mail and I jumped on snapchat and show you guys some my finger swatches and showed you the packaging and the palate all that jazz and i asked you guys if you would like to see me uses in a video or do a first impression I'm not kidding I have so many snaps requesting it that my snap literally froze and shut down I went to Twitter when I swear that we're coming in so fast I could barely read them just from people asking to do a first impression and say thank you because i mentioned recently that I've just been kind of a rut I haven't been feeling inspired by am taking action to make changes in areas so that i can help get myself out of that but honestly you guys just seeing you so excited over an eyeshadow palette has really just made me so happy and you guys can just kind of like relive my excitement right now for makeup and that's why I'm here right now i am just like so happy to be doing this right now so appreciative and thankful for you guys and your excitement for makeup in general so I'm just happy to be here the first thing I want to say about this though is the same thing is on snapchat and on Twitter a couple of nights ago is the packaging itself slave my soul like when I saw Kylie's snapchat of this I didn't even care what was inside this box when I saw this Elvis up Oh God can you have to buy open up and like all shattered I would die I just think it is so cool and different can we talk about this like you talk about those this comes whatever you order the palate this comes in there with a little note on the back and I like I can't so this is what the palette itself looks like right here you can kind of get an idea for the side it's like a very small and compact carboard very extremely lightweight and on the back it has the shades right there it has her signature I think this is like the coolest concept right here it's like so simple but yeah it's like a very modern and edgy come on this is like of course we all saw this we were all like yes perfect I have watched this one this one this one this one these maps shades right here on my hand i showed you guys on snapchat I will say the swatches are very very promising but again that's just a finger swatch so we will see how it actually goes on the eyes I'm going to be completely and totally honest in this video I have absolutely no reason to lie to you guys I never have and I never will the data i start lying to you guys for any reason is the day that my mom will bend me over her knee and spank me and shut my channel down i will be totally honest with you guys about this as I always have been as I was honest about her liquid lipsticks when I first came out so i gotta put that disclaimer out there are no one's paying me I did receive these this palette for free from Kylie cosmetics and just got in today i am doing this video by request and that's all i have to say let's get started I don't have already mentioned but I do have my entire face a foundation concealer and powder so my base is already completely done we're going to go ahead and jump right into the eyes and the first cause i'm going to pick up is this one right here a warm medium matte brown I would compare this to something along the lines of like back saddle I'm going to be up on a fluffy natural hair brush guys I'm like anxious and excited to see how these apply and then just go ahead and put this right in the crease oh my gosh so far so good you guys I'm liking or what I am shading and it's even more so you can really see what I'm doing oh don't be scared now that I have this product on the brush I'm going to bring it all the way in to the inner corner because i am going to cover my entire lid with product today so I'll just lightly feather in their applying just like any other shadow that I like applies like it's applying similar to make a big shadow it's applying similar to Mac shadow to have to say on a different note I feel like back shadows have kind of gone down recently like it's not just need his I've start using more and more brands like my standards have gone higher but I feel like Max shadows used to be better especially the shimmers I don't know why but anyways not important ok so now i'm going to pick up this shade right above it which is a definitely a little bit more of a cool tone have a little more of a great undertone in it i'm gonna be using the exact same brush and this is the more feet and 4 4 1 by the way I'm going to go right over top of that now there's a little bit higher up in the crease but right over top of it this color is applying beautifully I mean since the first one apply beautifully i'm sure all the mounts will but you never know because sometimes in some pallets there's a lot of inconsistency like one that would be gorgeous and then that's one right next to it won't like blend you know I'm saying all right now I'm going to pick up the middle shade oh it is so pretty and that is in the shade sit trying side trying to trying likes tron tron so trying oh god I'm like an idiot going to take like a little less amount of it and I'm just basically going to like take my brush and go like this and just like dab a little bit of it down a little bit and it just that I haven't a little amount of products into my brush and then i'm going to very lightly with a more light hand go over that whole area just to give it that warmth and brightness in an orange shadow does oh yes Kylie I'm a I'm a little impressed not gonna lie I'm going to pick up a smaller blending brush it basically looks the exact same time as any to a bit smaller and this is the more p.m. 4 3 3 i'm going to go back and with that original color right here with and I'm just going to put a little bit on the brush and I'm not just going to press this kind of on my lid just like a light sweep to get that color I want us to basically be a matte look honestly you guys the shadows are blending and so well I mean you can see it on camera you know like you can't fake it you can see how well they're blending they're not choppy they're not strike either . patchy really impressed right now now i'm going to grab the shadow all the way down here and this is opposite Ian ok I'll come all these names for things i have no idea how to pronounce what time you go back to school and this is a really pretty like medium tone very warm rich reddish-brown reminds me of like a mac swiss chocolate so this one as I swirl my brush in this one it did have more pickup then the others right here but i will say i know just from other stuff um I'm working on that Reds are typically like that if you ever swatch a shadow that has a lot of red pigment in it and it kicks up a ton of shadow it's really really tricky to develop a red undertone um I shadows so it does have a lot of take back compared to the other one's gonna go ahead and put this out here and this has a nice pigment - I'm going to get a little bit more I don't fall out yeah this has a really nice pigment for a reddish shadow because again it's really hard to get good at pigmentation when you're working with red shades i know a lot of times and pallets i'll be so excited about the red color like the cranberry color and then when you actually go to use it it was like actually no pigment and it's just very tricky to develop red will say this one is not applying as easily and the other the others were so like worry free and so easy this one I'm having to kind of press it in a little bit more but again that's probably because of the red it has a little bit more fallout but still this is nothing I would like complain about this is just very standard to me you know this is the same as any other eye shadow brand so now for this part i am going to just bake my under-eye really quick i'm going to go in with the darker shades and I just don't want like any of it to fall out like the dark round the black to fall out and like mess up my foundation so I'm going to grab some translucent powder and a damp Beauty sponges if you do your foundation first and then you want to go in with dark shadows and you're scared that you're going to get all of your face this is just a way to make sure that you do not ruin your concealer and foundation because you can just sweep all the products away and you're good to go I mean you look a little bit like a freak while you're doing it but whatever alright so now i'm going to grab the middle shadow on the bottom and this is in the shade bronze aight and this again is Matt so far we have only worked with the matte shades and a brush I want to use for this I'm going to stick with the same exact Russia I've been using and I'm going to pack this on oh this is nice pigment i'm going to pass on just a tiny bit right on the lash line area and then just ever so slightly put any outer corner of my eye I don't want this to be too intense i'm going to keep it kind of light for this part you're not going to do you take just a small angle brush like this one right here going to dip in a translucent powder and i'm going to carve out I don't know if you guys ever seen you this before but this is a great trick if you want like a slanted katish type I but you don't want to use tape or you have on foundation already i'm just going to stamp it on there just like this and then and it will make it so that we wipe it away you have just like any media cat eye I'm going to go back and I'm going to grab a little bit of these two shades and mix them together a little bit of that warm brown and that one tiny amount on my brush not too much i'm going to blend out this harsh line right here on the edge just with tiny little wiggling motions now as you can see i'm slightly getting rid of my translucent powder that's okay you have to worry about that you can go back and grab a little bit more of it and just put it right over top that line and let it sit and it will just continue to erase anything that you bring down there right now I'm going to grab a pencil brush any pencil brush will do and then I'm going to go in with the black shade right here and this one looks like it's going to be super black I'm going to take this and I'm going to run it right along my lash line I am just dipping my brush like one dab into the black because i don't want to get tons and tons of fallout so when I pick up the black i'm literally going like poop like one thing and then tapping off the excess and you can see the pigment that gives ok so at this point i have used almost all the matte shades except i have not used this one just because i personally and not like matt white vanilla cream kind of girl i know that tons of people are which is why everyone's in their palates I'm not on for the purpose of this video I'm going to go in with a sugar color but typically I would just leave it like this and put on some lashes mascara and clean my brows and all that jazz but i'm going to use one of the shimmer so we can see how they apply and I don't know which one ordered I'm going to do this one it picks up nicely like I want to I'm grabbing it with my brush like it seems to pick up nice it doesn't have like doesn't get chunky or anything i'm going to go ahead and apply it right in here in the inner corner ok so i'm not getting much of anything on my eyes but I actually thought about this was applying the matte shadow beforehand because it most of the time when you apply a matte shadow before a shimmer shadow you don't get any color payoff and I thought about that as i was applying the matte shadow look at this was on just regular bare skin i wonder if it'd be different so what I'm going to do is I'm going to like prime back of my hand really quick and i'm going to apply it to my hand to see if it applies better because it might be because the fact that i just put a matte shadow down and then shimmers don't work i'm going to apply the exact same shadow that I just tried to apply on my legs I feel like I didn't give it like a fair chance i don't want to say that it's terrible before I try this so this is tiger eye again the same one that I used on my island i'm going to pick up the same amount on my brush right there and let's see if we apply it like this okay see now look now we're getting pigment like its supposed to have let me grab the other eye shadow wipe off my brush I'm going to grab the other shimmer and try okay see so they are showing up on my hand with a brush perfectly fine so I'm going to just say that the reason it's not showing up on my lid is because the fact that i use a matte shadow first i'm going to go back over which is a little bit more black eyeshadow because I just want to look to be smoky you know I figure if we're doing a first impression videos of eyeshadow like we get to do something dark and smoky and really see what the shadows can do right all right I'm just grabbing a brush and wiping away my under eye area to get rid of all that bacon judge and now you can see what that translucent powder did for my eyes how it made it like a nice slam right there see how it just cleans it up and gives you a cat eye it's a really nice tip can see it right there I'm just going to make this a little bit sharper facebook to learn that me and I was like wait a second this looked a little on the blender if you ask me okay i'm going to grab the middle shade right here and the very top it's another shimmer and it is in the shade courts i'm going to attempt to highlight my brow bone this don't know it's going to be too dark so let's try this one I don't know we'll find out oh yeah it works ok cool it's working I'm going over it with Jasper which is the light creamy matte shade I'm going to pop on a pair of lashes i have not tried yet and they are fluff and dolled up so by the lower lashes on my god dog up i used to wear those back in the day but these are like the newest silk version of them alright so now i have my lashes on and I'm so mad at myself and I was applying mascara I got it right here like a huge glob and I had trying to get rid of it and it's much my eyeshadows and my eye shadow looks like it's all like unblended my this is my actual name they're all right I'm going to grab a pencil brush this is like an old pencil brush from sedona lace from like years ago I'm going to grab the shade right here the warm kind of caramel brown shade i'm going to just put that right on my lower lash line now i'm going to take this reddish brown shade in the far corner and i'm going to put that right over top my the only person that doesn't really look at themselves like when they do this like they just feel for it and just look around the room I'm going to pick up a small definer brush like this right here and I'm going to dip into the black i'm going to put that just on the outer corner of my lower lash line I'm trying so hard not to make my face when I always do when i apply eyeshadow on my lower lash line Oh almost made it to that that was a lot of work i'm going to apply some mac coast outreach I pencil in my waterline because i think my wife looks a little bare alright so i just threw on some makeup obviously to finish off my luck but I figured you guys might want to see that because this video is about this bad boy right here right so i will say that my overall take away from this palette is that if you are looking for every day neutral basic palette just applied easily you're not looking for anything that - metallic not looking for anything that's too difficult or too bright or intense this would be the palette for you it is a great everyday like girl next door palette i will say for me personally I wish that he shivers had more of a pop more like a metallic miss to it but that's because i am secretly a drag queen insights I always apply my shimmers with mac fix+ or unless they're like a really intense already much how i like foil shadow I'll if i go on the shimmer our to be shimmer like I don't want a subtle shimmer I want like glitter you know um but some like my sister who just loved like that everyday look like she would love these shimmers because they have a nice color palette but there's a very subtle when I tried to apply it over my matte eyeshadow it did not work but honestly I was stupid for even trying to do in the first place I know better than that but when I prime my hand and put it on my hand with the brush they were beautiful so I honestly don't think that that's kind of how she intended it because the fact that there are so many more max there's only two shimmers in the nine color palette so everything that she didn't want you to be very vibrant and intense obviously because she made them a little bit more subtle post like a really intense like metallic creamy shimmery eyeshadow you know overall i would give this palette and a for sure i would get the packaging and eight plus this is sick nasty islands packaging so much and I was Kylie out of blow this image up like gigantic like the size of a wall and then put up my couch for my better something exciting is just so cool anyways I'm gonna stop rambling thank you so much for watching this video you guys I really hope that you enjoy I love you thank you so much for requesting

and his dramatic is over the top I absolutely love it this look is for my Queens or more like a day-to-day neutral girl at times other tutorials for that and i'll be back with more than to look later but today we are feeling ourselves okay that's better lost my staff members like it I know the Blues can be intimidating but just don't forget to blend and take your time and all will work out I promise practice makes perfect and that my mom always said late at night before you wash your face just pull out your makeup brushes pull out your palate and just do your makeup provide minutes and if you're trying to learn new techniques like this lower last technique or a winged liner just try for five minutes every night it's just make up a white sauce you can just try it wipe it off try it wipe it off wash your face go to bed sleep on it try the next night you know what I'm saying if you do that for a few nights in a row i promise you can earn any technique that you want nothing is intimidating nothing is too hard to achieve a makeup you got this and remember it's just makeup you know I'm saying wipes right off and you can forget it ever happened enjoy the video i love you guys and I'll see you soon bye hello my loves my eyes already primed and i'm going to be going in with make a geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow i know i use this in the beginning of every single makeup look but it's so similar my skin tone going back and forth with this in my entire crease area just makes it so that no matter what colors I choose to go in with its going to blend easily now i'm going to go in with makeup geek unexpected this is the perfect transition color if you're working with blues or purple because the cool cool tone grayish purple is just perfect and it's matched so using that same Sigma e-40 i'm going to dust that back and forth all the way from the inner corner to the outer corner in the upper crease area now i'm going to go in with the star of the show and this is anastacio star cobalt this is a very intense metallic eyeshadow so when I apply this I pull my eyelid taught like you can see me pulling it there to really get all that pigment all over the entire lid and it gives a very shimmery look I'm going to make sure that i put this on the entire lower lid area but i do not want to go any further than my crease I want to keep this nice and low because the issue with colors like this is if you take it - hi all of a sudden that's when it becomes a mess so keep it low keep it on your lid and do not surpass your crease area now i'm going to go in with a sigma e25 brush and a little bit more of that unexpected eyeshadow and we are just going to begin to blend blend blend back and forth and windshield wiper motions all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner until you see that blue shade is no longer a harsh jagged line in the crease then i'm going to go in with mac blackberry eyeshadow this is just a few shades darker than unexpected which is why i'm going in with it because you want to start off with a lighter shade and then blend that and then go darker and then blend that you never want to just go in with a dark shade and expect that to blend out beautifully so you blend in between every single step and that is how you achieved a flawless blended smooth smokey eye that does not have any harsh jagged lines so once we have moved on from that step I'm going to take a makeup remover wipe and clean up the under eye and i will also use this to create kind of a cat I with that shadow it's a nice easy trick to kind of get that shape that you want that very sculpted I look and then i will go in with Maybelline gel liner and shader black is black and then just create a typical black winged liner the great thing about using and that makeup wipe to remove the excess and creating that harsh line as you can then follow it with your eyeliner so it makes it simple to do a wing now i'm going to go in with makeup geek poolside eyeshadow absolutely gorgeous I should have done this before my eyeliner but I didn't think about it and once my eyeliner was done I was looking in my eyes and I was like we need something else so taking the same brush this is the mac 242 that I used to apply the star cobalt i'm going to just tap this on the center of the lid and then blend out and as you can see it just gives the I much more dimension it just kind of brings that upper lid together then I'm just going to go over and fix my eyeliner and just kind of go over that and make it blacker because we completely messed up because I should have done that step first so if you are trying to throw us off at home do that part first then do your liner now I'm going to be applying lashes i am using house of lashes iconic these are my absolute favorite lashes at the moment I can't get enough of them I wear them every day I wear them with no liner liner a smoky eye a neutral I I swear they are just so gorgeous i'm in love with them right now we're going to go in and Prime at my skin and I am using makeup forever radiance primer using clean hands of course we're going to use this all over our entire face and then i'm going to be using a newer foundation today and this is by the brand LC cosmetics oh my gosh you guys I talked about this on snapchat I'm just so in love with it right now and i'm also going to be wetting my face with some mac fix+ the reason I'm doing this is because this LC foundation is definitely made for those of you who are more oily to normal maybe combination skin since I am dry I don't want it to be so Matt so i use a radiance primer and then i use a dewy skin missed or a mac fix+ just to give a little bit more of a glow to the skin because it will dry extremely mad on me i am using it be more foundation brush this is the m4 39 my favorite foundation brush right now it just smooths everything out so beautifully and because of the size and the density it just makes it so that you don't have a build up a foundation on the skin and you don't go overboard now i'm going to do with the under eye concealer of course I wanted a bright highlight today so i'm going to start off with using the Urban Decay weightless naked concealer i think it's called something like that you know what I'm talking about i'm going to use this in a triangle motion I'm going to take it down the sides of my nose and I'm going to drag it back toward the temple using a very damp Beauty Blender I'm going to blend that out word i'm bringing that down on the cheek area and then I'm going to take it all the way up to kind of emphasize the center of the cheeks and then up towards the temple to give that lift i'm also going to even out that highlight by putting it on the chin the upper lip the nose and the center of the forehead and then again go back with the damp beauty blender and blend that out using a damp Beauty Blender will make sure that you have tons of excess product it will pick it up and you don't have cake face that's why i love the beauty blender because like right there i put a little too much product in my upper lip but that's ok when you're working with the beauty blender because it'll pick up the excess and you're not going to have cake frosting see on your upper lip because that's not good on anybody i'm going to set my under eye concealer and i'm using a mac emphasize which is a pro product and i'm going to mix it with the anastacio banana concealer and i'm going to really highlight that under area again on the size of the nose the cheeks up towards the temple and then i will also set it on the chin the Cupid's bow the nose and a little on the forehead as well because we want to even out that highlight you're going to highlight you got a highlight do it all girl don't miss any spots now i'm going to go in and take care of dem browse i am using anastacio brow Wiz in the shade nope i believe and then once i have filled in my brows I as always use a little bit of concealer underneath that brow just to help carbon out and give it a little bit more dimension especially on the arch of the brow now i'm going to go in with mac shroom eyeshadow i'm going to use this to highlight the upper brow bone I absolutely love highlighting the brow bone especially when you're doing a smoky eye it just give that glamazon very bombshell look to the eyes and I just think that it is beautiful so I always make sure to highlight then i'm going to also highlight generously on the inner corner of the eye because the technique we're going to use on the bottom lash line is really going to pop with this highlight on the inner corner so I'm packing on that highlight and then i'm going to go in with the anastacio cream color and the shade ice blue she came out with i think five or six of these cream colors and they're so pigmented they are amazing I was nervous for putting on my waterline was going to irritate my eyes but it didn't it didn't burn it didn't sting is gonna irritate them which is surprising because I my eyes get so irritated so easily in this color like can we talk about it is so beautiful now i'm going to go in with mac navel this is a pro color so you can get on mac cosmetics , or at prostores is a very dark navy blue kind of purple shade it is more on the cool side which is different for me but that's why I chose it it's gorgeous and I love that it's a matte color so i am just using an angled brush as you can see i believe this is Action Anastasio brow brush technically but whatever moving on I'm gonna line this very tightly on the lower lash line and then once i get to that inner corner as you can see instead of sticking to my lash line going to cut it go down and create almost the effect of a cat I i do have a tutorial going in depth on this a little bit more i will link it down below it was my trendy i tutorial i believe it's called as you can see here i right i just was not as perfect as a left so I went in with a little bit of concealer on a definer brush and I just kind of clean it up we all make mistakes but it's okay it's just makeup you can clean up your mistakes and move on no one ever knows i'm going to just blend out that lower lash line using any pencil brush I don't really have any additional products on this I just kind of went in and blend it out I didn't want the bottom lash line to be too overly smokey I wanted it to be nice and defined but I didn't want to be too intense just like a jagged line I never like jagged lines let's get real i'm all about that blending life I'm gonna call my lower lashes with mascara and now i'm going to go in and contour today i'm going to be using if you make it forever bronzer and number 0 and we are going to kick it old school baby with the NARS eat a brush oh I forgot how much I missed this brush you guys I love it so much if you want to structure contour i still stand behind this brush it is so amazing as you can see right here the proof is in the pudding it's just so easy to contour with it just makes such a beautiful line but because the bristles are nice and kind of fluff out it's not too intense and too harsh to the point that you're like oh dear god it's just an amazing brush i absolutely love it now i'm going to go in with blush and i am using a beka blush in the shade sweet pea and i'm going to be using the morphe for blush brush which by the way this is the first blush brush ever that has made me turn my back on the mac 129 it is amazing I'll talk about more in depth later but I just absolutely love it now i'm going to carve out my contour i'm using the morphe 510 brush and any light powder that you have as long as it's matt will do for this put it right underneath that contour and then just wipe it away and that will help just kind of strength in your contour and make it look more structured so that it's not messy then taking a little bit of bronzer i'm going to put that right underneath the lower lip and it will help it look a little bit fuller and a little bit more pouty know all the tricks i decided to go back in with a little bit of black eyeshadow because I just felt like that inner corner wasn't popping enough for me so just taking a little bit of makeup geek corrupt i'm going to put that on that inner corner just for a little bit more of a pop then i'm going to highlight the cheeks and i'm going to be using the hourglass ambient lighting powder in the shade luminous light i'm using the morphe and 501 brush for this this is like my favorite highlighter brush of all time and i'm going to place this all over the cheeks the cheekbones for a little bit of a glow that i'm going to set my eyebrows with anastacio clear brow gel which is the best brow gel and the entire world i swear to god it's super glue in a tube for your browse now i'm going to pair this look with a nude lip I was going back and forth and I didn't want to do a pink or peach because these eyes just makes such a statement so I decided to go with anastacio liquid lipstick in the shade pure Hollywood which was a beautiful nude and what I love about it is it stays all day because it's a liquid lipstick and it doesn't require a lip liner so last but not least we're just going to now set our face i'm using Urban Decay to makeup setting spray just to lock all this and and we are done I hope that you enjoy this video you guys

and what you are comfortable with but i absolutely love this I love the technique is completely different than anything I've ever done before and you guys will see how easy it actually is it looks much more complicated and complex and like a picture that you're going to see that actually is so i hope that you guys enjoy enjoy making this tutorial for you i love you guys and if you want to see how to achieve this look then just keep watching my god hey guys so first thing I'm doing is moisturizing my lips I always do this before i start my makeups my lips it goes on more smoothly at the end and there's no what chapped lips get in the way that I'm going to throw my hair up in a high ponytail so I get all that hair out of my face so you guys can see what we're doing I'm going to prime my lids i'm using a mac pro longwear concealer and nw20 is my favorite all-time primer for the lids because it conceals and primes at the same time so it's perfection then i'm going to be going in with my new babies oh my gosh i love these eyeshadows so much these are the new anastacio Beverly Hills single eyeshadows they will be releasing next month and you guys will be the first to know because i will let you know the second they release they are beautiful I'm going to be going in with the shade birkin this is just a really nice neutral tone it's great for that crease area as a transition color is very similar to like a mac soft brown type shade if you're familiar with that i am using a Sigma e-40 blending brush to dust this all over the entire crease area you can put this all over the lid if you want you don't really have to we're really just focusing on that crease area i'm just buffing it out nice and gently with no harsh lines that i'm going to be going in with a gel eyeliner this is the key to this look I'm using Maybelline eye studio it from the drugstore it's black as can be and it's awesomesauce so what I'm going to do is create an outer wing i am using a e65 by Sigma I don't know what brush that was for a minute i'm going to create kind of like a bat type wing where I literally just carve out that V and then sharpen it up once I've done that I'm going to go in with the shade smoke this is again going to be a new shade by anastacio beverly hills and then using a more fee and three two one brush which is literally the most perfect brush for this technique I'm going to take that brown color and literally as your scene just smudge it and some oak it out it is so simple I'm going to go back with that same black liner and just darken it up a bit and you will have this look right here it's so simple but it looks more so much more complex than it is now i'm going to do is just go in and do a normal liner right on that lash line just like you would any other day just to kind of connect that wing to the inner corner now i'm going to do to create that inner corner cat eye is follow the natural tier duct of my eye some people's inner corners are going to go a little bit more down than others some are going to go more straight out i typically find if you want to look the best for your eye shape when your eyes are open and close just follow that natural tear duct so now i'm obviously just going to do the exact same thing to the other eye again I just draw out that V with an angled brush and I just fill it in as you'll see right here you might feel like wait what do I do with the eyeliner because you actually want to connect it to something don't just literally a buff into the i leave it alone go back with a super dark brown matte shade and just buff it out you don't really want about that . color up into the crease you more want to buff it towards the inner corner of the eye to really give you that long it elevated cat eye effect then again do your liner just like you usually would along that lash line and then make sure you take it all the way to the outer corner so that does connect with that wing again I'm going to do the inner corner of the same way that the other eye this might be easier for some of you just using a precise eyeliner brush it's not an angle brush I definitely think an angle brush can be a little bit harder but it's just what I'm used to I'm going to go in with the lower lashes in the style lash in the city but I always cold my lashes with a thin coat of mascara first before going in I think it makes it blend a little bit better and also i never ever going with mascara after my false lashes are on because it can cut down the longevity in the life of your lashes and make them look a little bit more fake and I want my false lashes to look as pretty and fluffy as they possibly can so I don't go in with mascara afterwards I always do it first then i'm going to move on to foundation I'm using our glass of ale foundation it's a very pretty eliminating foundation i will say though that it has a high SPF in it so it does smell like SPF just a warning i'm going to be going in with a morphe brush this is the end for 39 i believe for foundation absolutely obsessed I've used only twice and i'm already claiming i'm obsessed you know what's love when I've only used it twice i'm using the word obsessed moving on I'm doing my eyebrows and I just showed you the first one super quickly because it was really out of focus the entire time i'm going to show you this one a little bit more slowly i am using the anastacio browse in the shade oh no i forgot the shade soft brown taupe I don't know i'll link it down below for you guys but I am going to go ahead and fill in my brows like normal with you guys want an updated brow routine just let me know in the comments section down below I'm going to conceal my under eye area and i am using NARS radiant creamy concealer to do this I know a lot of you've been saying recently that i have exchanged this one for the mac pro longwear and it's true you guys I just been using this recently i go through phases and this is just it's my boy right now so it's what we're doing I've been enjoying it and if you guys are wondering i do my concealer and foundation after my eyes when i'm doing a smoky or a cat eye look because sometimes you can mess up your foundation if you do your eyes second so doing your eyes first will ensure that you have the perfect foundation application and eyes as always i'm going to set my under eye area i am using mac pro longwear emphasize powder mixed with an associate of Beverly Hills banana powder this is from her contour kit and it also has put a little bit of that on my chin and my forehead just to even that out cuz sometimes a highlight underneath the eyes by itself can be a little overwhelming when you don't balance it around the face I'm going to go in with that same smoke color from anastacio if you guys can tell this is like the easiest thing ever right it's only two eyeshadows that is creating this look like yes please I'm going to go back in with that original shape that we went in Birken and i'm going to just buff that out with a pencil brush on this entire lower lash line if you guys don't have to be super smoky you can leave this part out and just do mascara and call it a day I wanted to blow it out I wanted to show you guys the full production the full effect and all the drama and potential this look really has so I'm going to call my lower lashes with Rima lash accelerator this is from the drugstore and it's one of my favorite lower lash mascara because it really separates your lashes and I don't like coffee bottom lashes I'm going to go in with mac cosmetics mylar I wanted to keep this look very mad I didn't want a lot of shimmer and it because I just absolutely love a smoky Matt I like who doesn't it's classic and it's timeless and my lawyer is a beautiful highlight that isn't a full map but it's not a shimmer house like this beautiful gleam to it then I'm going to go in and just do a little bronzing and contouring i am using a nars bronzer in the shade algorithm this is part of their holiday collection and i am using a morphe brush this is the 200m be 5 NB five and i'm going to bronze my face I'm going around my cheekbones around the temples in the forehead I absolutely love this brush i have been singing its praises for the past like three tutorials straight but seriously bomb.com I'm going to go back in with a makeup geek precision brush and just create a little line right there underneath the cheekbones just to accentuate this contour a little bit more so I really like a structured contour with a cat i think it's very flattering I'm going to go and with mac mineralize blush in the shade dainty which is just a really pale flattering girly pink so pretty i'm going to lightly dust that on the cheeks nothing too intense but we just want to have a little bit of a flush this looks painful honestly this shot makes me cringe anyways I'm going to be applying and I call on that lower water line in the struggle is real as always as you can see and then i'm going to finish this off with my new lipstick this is called buttercup you guys are the first to see in the first to know I am so excited to be using this and introducing it to you it's going to be coming out in a week and a half I will let you know when it's formerly coming out I think this whole video is me just telling you like this is coming out soon this is coming out soon but i wanted to use some new products so I absolutely love this color you guys it is just a gorgeous nude pink I am so proud so happy so I hope you guys are as excited as i am i'm finishing that off with a little shimmer of hope gloss this is also by drug cosmetics i will link it down below along with a twenty-five percent off coupon code for you guys if you're interested to complete this look I'm just going to curl my hair with a Bellamy six and one and with the power of editing la we are done I love you guys thank you so much for watching and I'll see you soon bye hey is the day I'm gonna be doing a really fun dramatic bright over-the-top colorful blown out smokey makeup tutorial I am honestly so happy because in my August favorites i asked you guys if you would like to see a makeup tutorial using the shadow and times of you guys said yes which made me a very exciting i got to create something really fun and different and just up in the box it's ok i hear my eye so anyway this is not the only way to wear a shadow of course like i did it very dramatic you can wear a really colorful shot like this in many different ways you can use it as a pop of color on that lower lash line you can put it gently in the outer corner of your eye can kind of look it up from your eyeliner for a little purple pop over you can wet your brush and then go in and do liner with it that is really really fun but you don't need to they're all or nothing I really wanted to see the shadow and its full capacity so i did a very dramatic blown out purple smokey eye which I love creating for you so yeah I really hope that you guys enjoyed this tutorial i enjoyed making it for you so thank you so much for watching and I'll see you soon but hey guys i am so ready to do this so the first thing I'm going to do is take smaller i call this is by Mac smaller is a jet-black putting a black color all over the lid is going to make any eye shadow you choose to put on later pop like crazy which you'll see in just a few minutes but right now i'm going to just sloppily put this all over my lid area cute so cute and I'm going to buff it out with an e 32 from sigma buffing out on I coal is actually a lot easier than you would imagine it to be because it is such a crummy pencil as you can see it really has a nice gradient to as your buffing out the only thing you want to make sure to do is not exceed your crease area as you can see as I'm buffing it out i'm not going anywhere past the crease in my eyelid so again i'm going to put that all over the lid and I wanted to be the blackest of the black right next to the lash line and then of course your buffing out and just kind of fading it once you get up towards that crease now i'm going to be going in with a new makeup forever artists eye shadow and if you can't tell i'm very excited about this color is in the shade em - 928 don't worry i'll link it down below for you and taking a sigma e25 brush I'm going to buff that in that entire crease area so this is just the next step we want to go from black to this plummy purple you guys can we just talk about how beautiful those colors right now seriously I cannot deal with it so as you can see i'm bluffing is all the way to the inner corner to the outer corner we wanted to be just as dark and intense from inner to outer then next I am going to go in with the shade orchid this is by ardency Inn and i'm using the exact same brush and I'm going to just go over top of that make up for ever eyeshadow and it's okay if it kind of falls down on top of what we've already done because we're going to go in and cover a lot of this up anyways doing all these steps is just going to give your smoky eye a lot of dimension and a lot of pop so when you're moving your face and you're moving your eyes people are going to see all different colors shining through now we are going to go in with the star of the show and this is in the shade royal oh wow she's so video to wall i am using a mac 242 to pack this color on my entire lower lid area all the way from inner corner of the tear duct all the way to outer corner I'm going to push that all the way up in my crease and then once i get to that crease area i'm going to go back in with the same brush that I used to apply that make up for ever eyeshadow and just blend those two together so that everything is seamless will have a very gradient I from a very bright purple to a plummy to be pink if you know what I mean and so basically you guys laying down that smaller eyeliner in the first place is going to make this eyeshadow pop even more if you ever want to take a color to another level just put a black eyeliner on before and it will just give it a really intense extra pop this is a very payment to shadow no matter what but I just honestly wanted to have a lot of fun and just see what we could do with it so as you can see i am using an e 25 just buffing back and forth to make sure we have no harsh lines then i'm going to go in with a black eyeshadow i believe this one is Mac carbon and i am using a makeup geek small crease brush just to I think this is a makeup brush I'm not sure I like this brush down below I'm going to pack that black in the outer corner of my eye just for a little something extra i will say a lot of times people can get nervous using Purple's they don't look like they have a bruised eye and the trick to that is using black and not grey do not mix great with your purple because that's when you can start to look like you got hit in the face caught in a dark alleyway but like this using black it really just gives a little extra smokiness so then I'm going to go in with my favorite lashes of life at the moment and they are by the brand flutter laughs ashes and this style is in the shade in the shade in the style Camilla all my gosh just get ready look at those flash oh my god they're so gorgeous I honestly want to wear them every day but they're very dramatic so they definitely call for a dramatic look so I was going to clean up that entire under eye area because of course working with bright colors you're going to have some fallout that i'm going to go in and do my foundation i am using giorgio armani a luminous silk and for those of you who asked i am currently using 6.5 as my color i believe is that down below to everything is always below i'm using my Sigma f80 kabuki brush just to buff this into the skin if you can tell I really press when i'm using this brush because it makes the foundation last longer now i'm going to be filling in my brows and i'm going to be using an SEO brow powder to do so today just because I thought I'd change it up so i am using the shade blonde and soft brown to do that but that's not fun so let's move on I'm going to be highlighting my brow bone with mac nylon this is such a beautiful brow highlighter it is very intense so make sure that you are light-handed when using it i'm going to be using a sigma f 72 highlight even though it's a concealer brush it's my favorite to highlight the brow bone and as you'll see i will bring this highlight down a little bit and turn my brush sideways and blend it in with that shadow in the upper crease doing this really helps complete the blending process to make sure that you have no jagged edges are harsh lines in that shadow area and it's beautifully buffed out it's a great secret makeup artistry and it makes such a difference then i'm going to just of course conceal hello this is necessary i'm going to be using my NARS radiant creamy concealer and then i'm going to be buffing out with a damp Beauty Blender I always make sure to tell everybody and make sure your beauty blender is damp that is what it is made for get it wet underneath the sink squeeze squeeze squeeze and then use it to apply foundation or concealer it just moisturize and hydrate the skin and it makes it so that nothing ever gets cakey and it's just fast and easy and it just looks beautiful so then i'm going to set that under eye area as always with anastacio banana powder this is an absolute must for me but you do you i'm going to use a flat definer brush and just pack on that same royal eyeshadow tightly against that lower lash line all the way from outer corner - the corner i'm going to make sure to take this all the way into that tear duct because I really want this to be dramatic and dramatic and bring it all the way really make the shadow more dramatic going back with that exact same m2m 928 eyeshadow for make up for ever and a pencil brush I'm going to buff this back and forth all over that lower lash line area putting two colors like this on that lower lash line will just make your eyes pop even more and get more dimension then using an e 25 from sigma i'm really going to buff this down I do not have any product on it but as you can see i'm going to just go back and forth over all of this under eye area and i will circle around on the edge of my eye to really make this look blown out cuz i want this to be more of a rounded I and a cat eye so that's why I'm going around the edges but i'm going to just pop that same nylon eyeshadow on the inner corner with a tiny little definer brush from Mac just for another little pop I love highlighting the inner corner and the brow because it really just evens out the I then i'm going to just mascara my lower lashes with remote lash accelerator and now i'm going to be bronzing i am using a Make Up For Ever bronzer and number 20 i'm using a nars a brush to sculpt out my face I will say number 20 and Make Up For Ever bronzer doesn't look dark when you're looking at it in the pan when you apply it to the face it's absolutely beautiful so even if you feel like you're kind of tan number 20 is really beautiful on tons of people so once i have done that I'm going to go in with becca flower child blush and i'm going to be using a mac 129 short handle brush to apply this all over the apples of my cheeks and then make sure you really blend into that contour so that everything is nice and buffed out of course they're going to go in with becca rose gold this is my favorite cheap product at the moment right now using a sigma taper highlighting brush I'm going to run that all over that blush area just to really make those cheeks pop and glow that i'm going to go in with a bite Beauty lip liner in the shade and nutmeg it's a really beautiful neutral pink color and i am using this to line the entire lip area and i will also fill in the lip area and then once i have the entire lips coated with nutmeg i'm going to go over it with my lip gloss i created with Gerard cosmetics in the shade buttercream which is amazing if I do say so myself and then once you have completed that you are completely finished with this look so hope that you guys enjoy this video thank you so much for watching I love you and I'll see you soon bye guys hey guys today I'm going to be doing in this makeup look at every single intro is always be a game and I'm gonna be going to make the turn on the look that I want right here anyway today I'm going to finally be going to make up tutorial i mentioned that was super pumped to fill my makeup tutorial like a month ago and this was a look that was referring to I have been so excited to film this love because I have to be honest I think this is the fate of my favorite look at least my favorite smokey eye and I've ever done here on YouTube but i love this look and the my favorite thing about it is that it will look good on every buddy any skin color any i call this is a comment absolutely everyone like it's got warmth in there and we get like up George he likes it too what I love about this look is it has some more than there but we also have a really fun color but the color is such an awesome wearable color for a smoky eye you know what I'm saying like if you're going to do a color of the smoky eye I definitely this is wearable and it's just so fun and it's different so i hope that you guys enjoy it I did add a double winged liner to this look you do not have to do that you want to do any liner you can do winged liner you can do just a regular black line you don't do anything special like I wanted to do this because the night that I came up with this look later that night I was in bed and I came across old photos of myself and when i first started working at Mac and I used to do the double winged liner all the time and I would you like a stripe in between out like a white stripe or like a yellow stripe in between the double wing and i was looking at that I was like oh my gosh it's so cool like I haven't done that in years so i thought i would incorporate it into this look to make it more fun so I what you guys do this video is not friendly i know i'm talking so much but that's because i miss you haven't been here in a while the past week has been so busy and the next week is also in certain busy I so many family and friends business associates all coming into town and I've had four meetings in the past week and it's just been a lot so starting februari fit everything is going fine go back to normal calm down a little bit but this like two week gap is like the busiest two weeks of my year pretty much so i am trying to be active on Twitter and Instagram though and they kind of keep talking to you guys so that you don't feel like I'm gone for too long so yeah I love you guys thank you so much for watching this video and i'll talk to you guys soon bye all right let's do this the first thing i'm going to do today is go in with makeup geek creme brulee and Peach Smoothie eyeshadow I'm going to mix those two together and then apply them in my upper crease area going all the way back and forth from my inner corner to my outer corner working in circular windshield wiper motions it is super important to lay down a light base as a transition color in that upper crease because it'll make everything else that you put on later blend seamlessly with no harsh lines i'm going in with an e 25 which is just a little bit of a denser brush just to make that color a little bit darker in the upper crease area then i'm going to go in with makeup geek cocoa bear this is one of my favorite shadows of all time and i realized i have not used it and quite a while and my videos so it's about that time again i'm going to take a knee 25 again and put that in the entire upper crease now i'm going to go in with a dark brown shade i honestly would not recommend this particular one this is ground brown from mac i would use whatever dark brown shade you have for yourself at home because it's almost kind of choppy and difficult to blend so I just want to go with this one if you got something else using a pencil brush from makeup geek which i absolutely love this brush I'm going to pack that on the inner corner of my eye right by mighty ducks and i'm also going to pack it on the outer corner of my eye as well leaving a blank space right in between kind of like a sandwich if you get this all over your lid don't worry because we're going to go in and cover a lot of it up anyways I always make sure to go back after every single step though and just blend everything out cuz that's really key - no harsh lines is continuously going back and blending now i'm going to go in with the star of the show and this is makeup geek oiled eyeshadow in the shade Houdini look at the beauty just take a moment oh my gosh the shadows are so gorgeous and i am using a mac 242 brush to apply this this is a flat synthetic brush which is just like my favorite brush ever to apply anything that's creamy or super shimmery or glittery because it really holds the product very beautifully and lays on the eyes beautifully as well so i'm going to put this all over the entire hi your lid for inner corner to outer corner and once i'm in that crease and I it's time to blend it into that cocoa bear that warm reddish-brown i'm going to go back with another blending brush and just go back and forth take your time do this for a few seconds I'm going windshield wiper motions and really make sure that those to kind of meet together beautifully and seamlessly so you don't have harsh lines because I completely covered up that dark brown was going to go back really quickly and pack a little bit more on the inner corner and the outer corner you could do this with a black as well to make it even more intense but i wanted to do brown because i just kind of like that brownish bluish kind of warm reddish-brown all together i think they're very complimentary and they just tied together beautifully and then once again i will go back in with the same blending brush and just make sure that all of that is blended out because I always blend every single step out then I'm going to take a q-tip and a little bit of eye cream or any moisturizer eye makeup remover whatever you have and I'm just going to gently kind of a wipe away the excess because sometimes you can get a little sloppy and this is a nice little trick to kind of sharpen up that outer corner make it look nice and energy so that it's not sloppy or you don't have fallout all over the place then I'm going to go in and do my eyeliner I'm using Maybelline gel liner in the shade of black is black as always an angled brush today I'm only going to do a little bit of liner on the outer corner i'm not gonna bring this liner all the way and across the lash line because i don't want to cover up this gorgeous shadow that I have going on so because of that i'm just going to do a half way and just kind of flick it on the very edge and then we'll be done with that I'm going to go in with a mac pro eyeshadow and this is in the shade Kelly I just wanted to add a little extra pop as you can see it's really not that big of a difference and not really that necessary but you know I'm having fun and doing my thing and so I wanted to add a little bit of this in the center just for giggles this is a mac pro item so you can purchase it online or mac pro stores it's not available at you know like regular counters or regular stores now i am applying the lower lashes in the style lash in the sea these have a little wing like a flick on the end of the false lashes which really compliments the winged liner look that we have as you can see right here the difference between both eyes but I did feel like the wing on the end it kind of slightly cover up my double winged liner so that's just a tip for you i am going to be priming my face with Smashbox photo finish primer water and oh my gosh you guys can we say obsession this is like my new baby so I'm going to douse myself in this primer water let it get a little dry of course dry off the lashes we don't need those things to be sitting there when the face and then i'm going to go in with my foundation I'm using make up for ever HD foundation and i am a number one two three as you can see my neck is number one two three and my face is like a negative zero so i am going to be matching my neck as always i'm using a sigma flattop f80 kabuki brush and i do miss it with a little bit of fixed plus from Mac just because I like how she was at my foundation a little bit and it has glitter in it so it helps just to kind of make everything stay together like glue for me some people can have reactions to fix plus so if you're super-sensitive so just be on the lookout for that so I'm just going to blend this all over the face as always nothing too special and I know that sometimes I can look a little yellow and this is going on but listen I'm matching my neck and that is what's important it will all tie together in the end I promise I'm going to of course conceal as always i'm using a mac pro longwear concealer my favorite concealer of life and a damp beauty blender which is my favorite way to blend out my concealer ever so i take this down the side of my nose and I go up towards my temple and it's very big upside down triangle motion and I blend all that out and then i dab some on the center of my nose the center of my forehead I always put a little bit on my chin and my upper lip on my Cupid's bow as well just to even out that highlight so that we do not have stock white under eyes and everything else is tad we want everything to be nice and even now i'm going to be going in and doing a contour and i am using the Chanel soleil de tan ok wow we're just moving on i'm using this cream bronzer from chanel and i am using an FTE again from sigma to do this I do prefer the f-86 which is angled but that was dirty so we're working with what we got right now so I'm going to put this all over the cheekbones and also the temples and the top of the forehead right by my hairline and then we're going to go in and sculpt this out a little bit I do intend on doing a full cream contour and highlight video very soon it's been very highly requested so i'm going to skip through this pretty quickly for you guys are not going to too much detail but i am using the Smashbox contour sticks to do this process that i am working with her right now and i'm using a damp beauty blender to blend everything out now a harsh harsh contour like this on day to day basis might not be so ideal and might not be ideal for any of you but I like a really intense striking contour when you're working with smoky eyes in a very dramatic look so I of course as always i'm going to set my under eye concealer and then i'm going to move on to my under eye area so i am using an angled brush this one is by morphy and i'm going back with the original color from makeup geek in the shade creme brulee and i'm going to just lightly kind of carve out that lower double wing that we're going to be doing I do want my double wing to be kind of smoky so that's why I'm starting off with a shadow and not just immediately going in with a black intense liner but i will go in and continue to make it a little bit more intense with liner but as you can see i'm going to do is go from that lower lash line and just run it parallel to that winged liner that we already have on the top lid this when you look at it looks like wow that's too complicated that's too much for me but if you really try on your own I you'll probably be very quickly surprised how easy this actually is to do on yourself so going back with a little teeny blending brush i'm just going to blend all that out because i do want it to be a little bit smokier than normal then with a little bit of concealer and a finer brush I'm going to put that in between those two wings so that it kind of stands out and it's a little bit more defined can we talk about how crazy is I didn't bring that blew down on my lower lash line I always bring the color down my lower lash line and today I did it and it's like what who am i but i really really like this i think that it just makes it look a little bit different than something that I would normally wear so I am is going back with that black gel liner and making it more intense i did just fill in my brows by the way I felt like it was unnecessary to put that on camera since i recently did an update a brow tutorial I am going to highlight my inner corner of my eye I'm using Mac nylon which is a very intense highlight I absolutely love it i use it for brow highlight cheek bone highlight any height you need nylon is a very intense shimmery yellow based highlight and very beautiful on tons of different skin tones so now i'm going to go in and I'm going to line my lower waterline i am using ardency Inn eyeliner and the black is color they have it is the creamiest of all time and then i'm going to go in and cut my lower lashes with mac google black mascara now i'm going to be highlighting my cheekbones and i am using the hourglass ambient lighting palette the center shade i'm not sure what it's called right now but look at how gorgeous this is it's like heavenly it's so beautiful i am using a sigma tapered highlighting brush to do this and then over top of that i'm going to lay down makeup geek spellbound blush which is a really beautiful kind of muted rosy pink and I just think that it looks absolutely gorgeous over top of this highlight it's like it's beaming through the blush I love it now to finish everything off i'm going to be going in with this new kat von d contour and highlight kit and honestly you guys i am just using an excuse to use this because i am so in love with this kit i am using the brush that you can buy along with it just to kind of set all the contour that I did earlier and sculpt out the John the chin and just make everything a little bit more precise and cut then i'm going to go in and finish off this look by doing my lips and i am starting off with the Urban Decay liner in the shade native I'm not overdrawn my lips or anything like that i'm just using it as a base and then i'm going to go in with lime crime coquettes which is one of my favorite lipsticks ever it's a nice kind of peachy pink kind of nude shade I love lime crime lipsticks because they last such a long time on my lips personally and then to finish everything off i'm going to go in with my favorite makeup setting spray and this is urban decay chill makeup setting spray you use whatever you want you do you boo that completes this look I hope that you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching i love you guys and I'll see you soon hey guys so for today's video I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look at just the right here all of my place I am really really excited to be doing this look because i have been wanting to do this look for about five weeks now and i was debating if I should do it or not sounds like I just say screw into a spring tutorials like I gotta do it I've been thinking about this look for way too long to not do it I five weeks I've been what I've been planning this look out honestly I talk to you guys about on snapchat I had to get this out of my system guys before jumping into a spring tutorials i'm very excited for spring and summer trends not excited for spring and summer because here in florida i get so humid enjoy brace yourselves but spring and summer makeup trends mmm very excited about I can't flippin wait flippin know why I that such a funny term oh yeah so for today's video I'm doing a brown and glittery smokey eye and let me just tell you it has been a journey finding a beautiful dark brown glitter I have been online for about four weeks ordering glitter from all different companies and even company the cell like over a hundred different litters it's so hard to find like a beautiful true dark brown leather so for today's video i use the pretty star groundwater that I could personally find on my hunt for today's tutorial I carried my silky I with a really intense dark brown lip and i'll be honest when the dark brown lip first came to the scene and people were wearing it I was like no thank you all passed that looks like doodoo all up on your lips not for me within about three weeks I was like do I absolutely love a dark brown lip now but it is not for everybody so for those of you who want to recreate this look don't think that you need to put a bullet you can do a nude and neutral lip and you will totally be good to go i'm going to call it the circle because it drives me crazy it's a very long story but people have asked questions about it and an electrician came here and made this mark on my wall he didn't have a pen with him and he's like well I don't have a pen as it will all I have eyeliner and he was a battle work so with my eyeliner he was like oh like a move that's what that is but this is changing very soon so it'll be gone for those of you who are like like I get it I'm like I'm like that - I'm nosy one of those girls let's just I get it I'm going to stop babbling now I swear to God I see that in the beginning of every single video don't I but anyways keep in mind that even though that this is a really dark smoky look this can still do more in the spring there are no rules there's trends of course but if you want to rock this and like at on a date night and the spring and girl do you all wear these colors all spring along like of course so that's the beauty of makeup people set trends but you're a person too so you can set a trend and I'm saying transferred to my people where people look for around friends I'm gonna be wearing this in the spring and summer you do what you want to do that's the beauty of makeup i love you guys so much for watching this video and i will see you guys in my next video bye guys hello my friends thank you for joining me here today first thing to do is pick up my morphe 35o palette and I'm going to grab this really light orange II kind of pale peachy shade us one of my favorites and using the morphe m4 for one brush I'm going to put this in my crease today I'm going to try to keep the colors a little bit lower on my eye because it's going to be really bold and intense so I don't want to go overboard and go up too high to the brow that i'm going to grab the shade which is a little bit more neutral but in the same tone as the first day that we went in with I'm going to pack that literally right on top the reason i will go in with two or three shades on top of each other is because it makes your job easier when blending out shades when you only blend out one color can make its kind of difficult you can sit there for a while can be kind of choppy when you go in with multiple shades over top of each other just a little bit at a time it blends out easier and it gives more dimension to the eye now i'm going to go in with this darker brown shade this is one of my favorite colors in the palette because it's such a beautiful brown it's not cool whatsoever but it's not to neutral and it's not too warm and it's the perfect shade of brown it's not too dark I absolutely love it so with that color I'm going to do the exact same thing as before and I'm going to pack that right on in the crease keeping it nice and low as you can see all the way to the inner corner but i'm not going to go up whatsoever on the bridge of the nose i'm going to keep it nice and flat on the inner corner I don't want this to be blown out to dramatic today since it's going to be such a dramatic intense dog I I don't look like i've been hit punched in the face is not a cute look so now i'm going to pick up a Natasha danone a palette and I'm going to use the shade aight aight viso 88 V and now i'm using the morphe em 433 rush this is my go-to blending brush if you guys need one blending i brush this is the one I would go with I can't live without this brush and as you can see this is a warm dark brown if you don't want to spend the money on Natasha danone shades i would suggest Mac swiss chocolate it's extremely similar to the shade you'll get the same result pretty much i'm going to pass that on the lid in the exact same area that I do with the other colors really making sure that its darkest in the crease of the eye and I'm going to go back and with my original blending brush with no product on it and just run over the edges to make sure that it's all blended out but as you can see i'm keeping it nice and light and I'm sorry not like nice and tight and low on the lid so it's not too dramatic and over the top now i'm going to pick up a kat von d and this is occur metal crush shadows I believe they're called in the shade energy and then i'm going to dampen my brush with mac fix+ and everyone always asks i put the product on my brush first and then I dampen it that's how I think I get the best results and now i'm using a mac 242 brush which is one of my absolute favorite go-to all over lid brushes i just think it's perfect it packs on pigments glitters metallics everything you can think of i just love this brush so much and I'm going to pack that on the entire lid from inner corner always outer corner kind of as a base for the glitter that we're going to go in with but first i'm going to go in with a gel liner and i'm going to be using color pop call me which is a dark brown kind of purple undertone and it's definitely a different color it's really pretty and i'm going to be doing just like a baby half wing today because I didn't want to leave the outer corner of my eye I totally blank but I didn't want to do something totally typical like always and do an intense thick black winged liner so I chose to do a dark brown and I thought that this dark brown was really pretty because it had some purple notes in it so it didn't just completely blend in with the rest of the look one hundred percent and i am doing like a baby half wing as opposed to doing a thick all over the lid wing I wanted to keep it just the outer corner and that way the glitter can kind of speak for itself and they're not both fighting for who's boss and then I'm gonna go in with obsessive compulsive cosmetics also known as OCC loose glitter in the shade coffee i'm going to be using it too faced shadow insurance glitter glue this glitter glue is hands down the best glitter glue if ever use I've tried so many from so many different cosmetic companies and this is my absolute favorite so you put the glitter glue all over your lid with the brush and then while it's still tacky you just go in and start packing on glitter and as you can see this is a loose glitter and I am barely getting any fallout whatsoever all my face if any like it really is the best glitter glue in the world I would never ever use anything else honestly especially if it's an occasion where you really don't want your glitter to be messy and you wanted to stay nice and perfect to face glitter glue is where its I'm telling you it is the bomb so using that same exact brush that I've used for everything else on the lid I'm just packing this glitter all over i want to make sure not to cover up my eyeliner on the outer corner and I want to grab some mac cosmetics reflex antique gold don't know why my face gets so splotchy I don't know I'm so sensitive you guys at my face is such a mess all the time and I'm just going to pack a little bit of that just in the center of the ideas for a little bit more dimension you really don't even notice that it's there it's just going to kind of make this one of your I pop a little bit more then I'm grabbing blinking butte lashes these are the style Samantha created Samantha's here on YouTube her name is Samantha with 3 s's and these lashes are beauti ful so I was pop some of those on and then i'm going to prime my face i am using the Becca back lighting filter or something this is the luminous fiber i'll link it down below I'm going to prime my entire face with that and i'm going to be going in with giorgio armani a luminous silk foundation one of my favorite foundations of all time and i am back to using a my morphe foundation brush brush this is the m4 39 brush I was on the artiste brush kick for a while which I still really love that brush but i have been back to this one the past couple of weeks i just love it it's one of those brushes that it's just it's always going to be there for you no matter what no matter what you go through no matter how bad times get that brush will always work I love it now i'm going to put on some urban decay naked skin concealer and I'm going to blend it out under my eye area i am using the new on kat von d & Beauty Blender collaboration which is why the Beauty Blender is black I think it's super cool even though you can see every little speck of concealer and Iran it's cool to see a black beauty blender and then I'm going to take that same concealer and put it down the center of my nose on my Cupid's bow and on my chin and i'm going to kind of just blend it out everywhere so that we have a nice highlighted center of the face as well because that under eye area was looking pretty white because my spray tan is very very orange you talk right now so I need to kind of even out the face then I'm going to grab Anasazi a banana powder and normally i mix this with some mac and the size but recently i have been loving just using this all by itself I feel like it makes my under eyes look better I feel like it kind of hides any creepy or dryness it really brightens it doesn't accentuate any like on like under eye lines or anything like that i love it now i'm going to be going in with giorgio armani powder I just discovered this like a week and a half ago and oh my god I why did I ever know about this powder before it is such a beautiful face powder so I'm going to lightly set my entire face with this powder that way i can go in with bronzer and everything will go on a nice and smooth I'm going to grab this color again that we use on the upper lid from the morphe 35o palette using any pencil brush I'm going to begin to put this on the under eye area all the way from inner corner to outer corner but when I say in our corner I don't like to go too hard on inner tear duct because then it can start to look messy especially throughout the day so I don't bring it all the way and I kind of just go towards the inner corner and it kind of stopped right at that tier . if that makes sense these shots are terrible when i was adding this I was like I need to lower my camera this is such a mess and the facial expressions i make i just can't so right now i'm going with that same Natasha didn't own a shade and I'm just fucking that out and then I'm going to grab some black liner this is by ardency Inn I've said a million times this is the best black liner i've ever used on my waterline it doesn't move it's so creamy and easy to apply and then I'm going to grab a little bit of a black shadow on a definer brush and just stay right on that lash line and just wiggle back and forth so that it smokes out look at my mouth though honestly I'm like all up in your face pretty much out of focus of my mouth hanging open like could I really chocolate like get it together haven't you been doing this for like three years now four years come on reevaluate your life i am putting mascara on my lower lashes of course i'm using L'Oreal what is this l'oreal carbon black voluminous mascara that's what it is and then for brows i'm going to be using the Anastasia brow definer oh you guys are probably gonna get sick of me talking about this freaking product but honestly you guys it is so good like I don't even care it's getting to that point in our relationship I am loyal you'll be getting our invitations very soon the wedding is happening we are in a committed relationship so let's just move on I'm going to be bronze in my face using Mac give me son I just recently purchased this product again I was shopping on like mac cosmetics calm and I saw give me son and I'm like oh my gosh why have I not use this if you guys are watching my very first videos here on YouTube I went through probably five of these like this was my favorite bronzer of all time i've been using again this week and I'm like why did I ever stop using this bronzer it's so beautiful and i am using the mac 135 brush to apply it and then i'm going to do just a little bit of cooking and I'm going to use some are cma no color translucent powder i'm going to let this sit here for just like two minutes while I just run over my face with some other products so that it's not as sloppy as i just applied it i am putting some anastacio clear brow gel which is the gorilla glue a brow gel honestly it's the bomb and i'm taking a little bit more of a banana powder and just putting it on the center of my base my chin and just kind of running it over like the t-zone area cause I just felt like I wanted to be a little bit more defined that way the bronzer didn't like run over to the center of my face i'm going to go ahead and blend out that bacon if you will always the best feeling when you blend that out on your contour like in your bronzer just nice and sharp and clean like I swear I think that's my favorite part of doing makeup now for blush I'm going to go in with two Mac blushes this whole palette you see here is matte blushes I'm going to grab modern Mandarin such a tongue twister for me and copper tone and i'm going to mix those two together and then i'm going to put that on the apple of the cheeks going a backward towards the temple kind of blending in with the bronzer I didn't want to be too much on the apples of my cheeks though because then I can look I had a sunburn I'm trying to kind of angle it to the side and brush it back i'm going to use the charlotte tilbury bar of gold to highlight this is my first time using it and I think it's really really beautiful and for the brush I'm using the morphe am 310 fan brush i mentioned this in my favorites video i have been loving this recently to highlight with I just think that it makes it so easy and just distribute it evenly across your face I've really been loving it I'm gonna take a little bit that same highlight and put on my Cupid's bow and then it's time to go in with our lip i'm going to be using jeffree star dominatrix which is a very very deep dark brown it does have a red undertone in it which I really really like because there are a lot of different shades of dark brown out there this one definitely has a red undertone which I just think is really pretty and complement to look especially like this one not to mention jeffree star liquid lips are one of the best and my personal opinion I'm not a liquid lip fan overall but i do like Jeffrey so yeah after you apply that lip we are good to go so i hope you enjoy this video you guys thank you so much for watching i love you and i will see you hey guys todays video is going to be a festive holiday makeup look I have seen that I request recently for gold glitter and red lips which i absolutely love because it's just still Christmas he's all like and I ran to my makeup collection i started pulling out my gold my glitters and I need to come up with this look at my mind and it was like gold foil glare on the lid and like a brown cut crease maybe with some purple smoke down underneath and an inner corner cat eye and I was like my creative juices were flowing at the mad scientist that sounds disgusting but you catch my drift and then I was like you know this is so over the top and so dramatic that it's not even obtainable it's just entertainment like it's fun for me to do and it's cool to look at like how many people are actually going to get inspired every create this not that many because it takes a lot of effort and a lot of precision so I completely change courses and I decided to do a makeup look that is obtainable for the average woman maybe someone who is more of a beginner and makeup and you're not comfortable doing over the top glam and tense glittery sparkly eyes for the holidays but you still want to look festive and you still want to look very glamorous this Christmas as well so this makeup tutorial is geared towards you I have one is look outside of my house four times in the past couple of weeks and each time I cannot even begin to tell you how many compliments i have gotten on this look from everybody just random people walking by my waitress the host is just so many compliments which is crazy because this look is so simple to achieve so since so many people have complimented i figured it's a great tutorial to do for you guys because it's so easy to achieve and if you are in the mood for it over-the-top amazing glam makeup tutorial just type it dramatic Christmas makeup looks and you will get thousands of results I think every day a new amazing makeup tutorial pops up in my subscription box so many people are coming out beautiful dramatic makeup looks right now so they are there are millions of them out there for you I just wanted to do something a little bit easier to achieve so i hope that you guys like this video it is going to be a top through video today meaning i'm going to be talking to you and I'm applying my makeup as opposed to a makeup tutorial with a voice over so you guys at the style this video let me know and I will talk to incorporate more voice overs in the future so let's jump into it so we're going to be starting off with my skin today so I'm going to start by priming my face i'm going to be using the Makeup Forever skin equalizing smoothing primer so i'm going to be putting this where I have issues with pores because I don't all over my face and I really don't want this to matt face so only going to put it right on the nose in this cheek area because that's really where the poor issue 6 not for the rest of the face i'm going to be going in with the hourglass fail mineral primer this is oil free and I'm going to be applying this to the rest of the face where I did not apply on the smoothing primer right there in the center so I'm going to put this everywhere else and it's not necessary to use two primers obviously you can just use one but I'm happiness ok so now for foundation I'm going to be going in with the new L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion I'm so excited when I saw that lore'l was coming out with a new formula and the true max lumi meas True Match Lumi used to be like my my ride or die oh my god if you guys remember from back in the day I used that for a year straight i'm using the shade + 3.5 so the system is a little different because the original True Match Lumi I'm a w5 and this is n 3.5 so I don't know how it works exactly but it looks like this little cushion and then foundation comes out there also it's so cute I'm going to go in with a new brush my morphe I haven't tried yeah it's brand new and this is the e 50 for me to lead collection so it's a synthetic brush and literally just going to take a brush and put it straight in here hopefully I like this brush oh god I'm like okay wait to see the color my beloved I've gotten so pale the past couple of days because I've been exfoliating and all my tan is coming off and it says it's a buildable coverage but I honestly feel like this goes on initially as a medium to full coverage it's really easy to build it up see can you see how much is going on my face like it's full coverage i really have to like spread it around so that I don't get cake face and I were not found a shin i'm going to go in with concealer and I actually just got to New on Real Techniques Beauty sponges because my was getting so nasty and dingy and falling apart and i stopped me . amazonas they just got in the mail this morning so so happy so I just went and wet this one under the sink and it's so firm I was like oh that's what it's supposed to feel like I have totally forgotten um so I'm going to be going in with the new makeup forever concealer I don't know these are actually out yet they sent them to everyone on their PR lyst but there wasn't any note as far as the launch date or anything in the bag that came in so i'm using shade why 33 so I'm just going to . it under my eye area like this if you're super creamy but it doesn't feel so thick that you're like oh this is not going to blend out like it feels really really creamy kind of slimy but very blendable it's super hydrating - it's not dry which is amazing so now it's going to take the damp Beauty Blender and i'm just going to blend this out I just bouncing up and down very quickly this is my favorite way to blend a concealer of all time is using any sort of damp sponge if you really dry on the under eye area a tip is to take some pics + from Mac like this and spread it on your damn under and then blend it out and that will make your concealer really really hydrating but because it has blisters and it will also help it stick to each other as well so if you suffer and struggle with super dry under eye area i would suggest using some mac fix+ on your beauty blender ok so now i'm going to set that and i'm going to kick it old school and have to kick it old school and I've been doing the same damn thing for the past year and a half but recently i've been using the laura mercier translucent powder and today I want to use the mac pro emphasize powder and the Anasazi of banana powder the nslc banana powder you can buy individually on her website and the mac pro and the size you can buy this on mac com or any post or I'm going to be using the morphe e 48th this is a new brush in your recollection I just got these yesterday and I haven't tried them yet so I'm just trying them now for the first time and then i'm going to just set that under my eye ok so not the face i'm going to spend it very lightly with a powder normally i would use the laura mercier well the laura mercier translucent powder but today I want to be as mad so I'm going to keep the old school using a demon mineralize skinfinish from Mac this is the shade medium is going to be using a big fluffy brush is the e34 morphy and i'm just going to get all up in there I'm just going to lightly set the face i'm not doing this for additional coverage mineralize skinfinish is very very light coverage so I'm just doing this simply just set the foundation in place so it doesn't run anywhere and this will make it really easy to blend products on the skin with bronzer and blush and highlight but this is not really going to get much coverage alright so now we're going to move on ties and I actually put a new lens on my camera today so look at what we can do all we can zoom in i normally film like a 50 millimeter lens so i can zoom into my eyes all the way and get closer but today gotten lensbaby so we're going to be able to finally zoom it ok so for the eyes I'm not gonna lie i'm challenging myself not to make a beat today because I always going to make a beat for this look especially i use the eyeshadow deserts and if you're a shot all time but today I'm going to branch out and use different brands so what let me see what i got here so I'm going to grab some shadows from the lorac Pro make it 2 palette i'm gonna start off with the shade right here called Tommy the third one in on the top row I'm going to take that and just dust it right there in the crease you guys know this process the transition color I'm going to not keep this precise really at all we're going to blend it out in this entire crease area and then once we don't have a type of product on the brush computer you put it there in the crease that's we're going to start working kind of upward just to make sure it's blended out in this entire brow bone area anything over here just going to go in and place that color initially right there in the pocket of my crease if you do not have a crease just create one just do this wherever you want to create a crease on your eye area if you have put it I just brings color up a little bit higher than your hood crease area if that makes sense it's a very important when you're blending your I try to not only going windshield wiper motions but also circular motion so I start off with windshield wiper and then I go in tiny little circular and I go back to windshield wiper and then I go circular that's really the key to getting an eyeshadow to blend is windshield wiper and circular a nice shadow color though like this ok so now i'm going to go in with my is not focusing now i'm going to go in with burlap right here which just had a little bit more of like a baby puke coloring do it with you know I all about that life i'm going to just layer that right on top of Tony the original quality when I'm with the exact same area is going to give it more dimension by layering the shades windshield wiper motions and then circular motions so it was kind of like put it on there like this kind of sloppy can see it really choppy and unblended and then we'll begin to do circular motions and windshield wiper just back and forth between those two motions we've got those two shadows on our eyes i'm going to grab the mac pro and besides shaping powder again that I used to set my under eye area in this time I'm going to put it on a eyeshadow brush my hair brush I'm going to grab this on a mac ok that's attractive I'm going to get this on a mac 242 brush just any flat synthetic eye shadow brush will work I'm going to get to pack this on the inner corner of the eye to make it nice and bright this powder is just so pigmented as you can see i love it so much for an eyeshadow i think it's so beautiful the great thing about it is that it's not frosty but it's not a full mass so it doesn't look chalky it hasn't a really beautiful natural sheen to it that's why it's so easy to apply and it looks so nice I'm just packing us on and just patting motions looking to make sure to bring this up in this area this will help open up the eyes more if you leave it just on the lid it kind of close the eyes but if you bring it up like this towards the bridge of the nose and towards the brow this will open your eye up i'm also going to take this and put it underneath the eye area and the inner tear duct area and make this nice and bright right here I'm doing this because we are going to go in and put some glitter liner in this area so I want this nice bright highlights too kind of shine through and make that glitter pop even more so that's why I'm pockets on the inner corner here because I now that we are very white eyed and right I'm going to just fill in my brows because it's a good time to do so I always start at the bottom of the ground to give it the shape that I want and I make sure to hold the pencil far down I never hold it up here otherwise it will make it really dark and intense i will it really lightly at the very bottom like a pencil and I just do light strokes to get the shape that I desire and then go from there I am constantly using the spoolie I cannot live without the spoolie I physically could not do my brows without this now i'm going to highlight my brow bone and i'm going to be using what do you know something better change i'm going to be using Mac nylon and i'm just going to strictly put it right at the tippy top part of the ground ball just like a little a little battle yeah i'm not going to drag it around and like blend it out otherwise it's just going to become too much too over-the-top to quickly so just right there at the high point so now i'm going to go in with my favorite Brown shadow right now and this is by anastacio is in the shade fudge I'm going to grab budge on a sigma e 15 which is just a flat definer brush I'm going to begin to press it really tightly into my lower lash line only strictly on the outer corner of the eye so we're just going to keep that like a super harsh line okay it doesn't look good right now but it will it's a process do not try to blend with a small precision brush like this one just pack it on there and make it harshly get sharp it's not going to look good but we will blend it out with a pencil brush I'm going to go back the same eyeshadow that I used on my upper lid i will grab you could grab Tony or burlap or any sort of warm round to use on your lid it does not matter either one of these will work I'm going to grab the burlap and just on the very tip of the brush this is the morphe e18 pencil brush and then i'm going to just put it directly over that fudge eyeshadow and just blend it in tiny little motions back and forth I'm kind of wiggling my brush downward so I'm kind of going like this and I'm going down like this because i personally love the look of a smoky lower lash line and the outer corner and when it's kind of brought down it really helps open up the eyes if your upper shadow was brought up your lower shot at shadows brought down on the outer corner it widens the eye and gives you a doe-eyed effect so that's what we're doing right now is we're opening the eye by dragging us down and out I need to do the no mirror makeup challenge I want her how bad I would suck at that because I don't look in the mirror a lot when I'm blending my lower lash line and i always think like I wonder how that I would do with that challenge i'm going to use the map , graphic pencil in the shade and see 15 / and w20 any cream eyeliner pencil will work I just don't want brown shadow in this water line I want it to be nice in wide-eyed ok next step is going to be applying lashes this is totally your call though you do not need to apply lashes for this look you could just do mascara and totally get away with it i'm going to apply lashes though because it's just going to add that extra glamour and it's very easy to apply lashes once you practice and get the hang of it you'll be able to pop them on like boom this is the Loreal voluminous carbon black such a good drugstore mascara so for lashes i'm going to be going in with on this legal actions by flutter these were limited editions they're no longer available what makes me so sad because they're like the most comfortable beautiful lashes everyone in my life they're extremely long though so I know that not everyone is going to like the drama these lashes on them personally like I do I'm just comfortable with myself and very dramatic lashes but I know that these are very over the top for a lot of people on it is important to find your lash and what works for you i always recommend the floor lashes whisper sweet nothings they are long so if you have small eyes or really hooded eyes you might not love them but they're so fluffy and girly and beautiful also the are dealt with speed and the drugstore those are great Vegas nay I know that she has some lashes that are so not at walgreens and alton and i have not tried them yet but I just order them online but I've heard great things about those and those are an expensive as well so there's so many great lash brands out there now it's just important to find like what style works best on you because we all have different styles so when I sit here and say oh my god I love this boss so much there's gonna be thousands thousands of people are going to hate it because it's not gonna look the same on my eyes that will on your we all have different shapes so please flutter please sheyla bring it back here so good I'm gonna pop these super duper close to the lash line and that's why my tweezers come in handy there are tools out there made for this aren't losers because these could definitely poke your eye out so I do not suggest going in with razor sharp tweezers on go in with an actual professional last tool but that's what they're so great for as you can get them so close to your actual lash line and not have any gaps or spaces I could never apply a lash without some sort of tweezer or tool like this is my secret to getting it so close to the lash line pop them what on I always start on the outer corner to make sure that that here is first and then I go in with the inner corner because the inner corner can always be a little bit testy here so i do the outer corner first just to make sure that we're all going to go alright so now we're going to move on and we're going to go in with some glitter liner we are going to be using the Urban Decay heavy metal glitter like glitter liner this is my absolute favorites glitter liner of all time so all I'm gonna do is line directly over where we put that white on the under eye area so i'm going to start on the inner corner and i'm going to get really so make sure that you don't do your mask area you need to do this with no mascara on the lower lashes and i'm going to get super duper tight to the waterline and just begin to stroke glitter on that area if you have mascara on at this point you're going to completely ruin it and get glitter all over your mascara so make sure you do this first I just start on the very inner porter and then I just drag you do not put on your waterline you don't want to put any inner rim you just want to put it on the skin right voice right underneath of the water line on the lash line ok so once you know that you are totally done applying glitter and that's when you can apply mascara to your lower lash line but i would not apply mascara until you know for a fact that you're done with your glitter otherwise you can just get messy and not have that clean look that we're going for i'm going to be using the volume mascara about having a quantum my mom squares is mascara so like let's give it a try and see what she's hiding up about trying so hard not to make my ugly face because whatever i apply mascara on like where is my sculpting powder ok so i'm going to be using Mac shade start today shade sir is actually permanent item at the mac pro store so you can get it on mac.com i believe and at any pro store it comes in a little individual pan like this its magnetic map shade started my favorite contour like all time I think it is such a good shade kind of want to try this brush for contouring I'm really scared of it I haven't used this before I kind of think that this could be cool this is the morphe e 58 brush so I'm going to try this for the first time for a contouring powder so since i haven't used it yet i'm going to get nice and dirty and rough I'm going to get a lot of product on there and then went to dust it out this is how I always go in with a brush for the first time and then I'll kinda like rub it on a paper towel beat it up a little bit the process I gotta show this bitch who's boss ok so because this brush to not make my contour on like precise and sharp i am going to just quickly do a little baking the only thing I ever do Scott that my face just bake away so I'm going to dust that off to clean up the lower half of the face and make it look much smoother more put together for blush I'm going to go in with this mix blush in the shade coral dream just like this Knicks have great blushes I love their blushes are very pigmented and they're very inexpensive which is just a bonus is going to pick that up and just go in short stroke emotions now for highlight i'm going to be going in with Bobby Brown bronze glow I'm not going on sheriff a paucity which is very hard for me because we actually look freaking course with this look but that's okay i'm going in with bronze glow because i'm trying not to you champagne pop so much even though it's my baby it drives me so crazy that my highlight looks like that on camera because I'm person as looks completely different person my highlight looks so smooth and blend it and then on camera it looks chunky and glittery and creepy and like clockwork almost every single time I need a subscriber you guys always Tony and my makeup looks a better person than it does on camera and I'm like why I need to figure out my lighting game but I mean I don't I do it all on my own like I don't have anyone to help me with my writing anything you like hire professionals to ask them like what I'm doing wrong because this is not the same oh ok so now for lips i'm going to be going in with her red um i have worn the captain lights for the night several times this is her collaboration with over cosmetics for a second liquid will be it's absolutely amazing the formula so beautiful it's nice and moisturizing it's not too dry and the color is gorgeous but today I'm going to go in with a true red this is ho ho ok just whatever ho ho by jeffree star so i'm going to be going in with this one I haven't used the shape yes i'm really excited to see it is liquid lipsticks they're so nice out of the password packaging their high-quality he is just awesome i love him it's serious it takes me it's such a long time to apply liquid lipstick or line my lips because my lips are naturally so on even like one side goes straight down and the other side is rounded and in this side goes straight down and then this side is so much like fatter and have it more meat in it my lips are so out of proportion I've always wanted to get lip filler to balance them out like temporary lip filler to see if it would look better but I don't kind of scares me but maybe one day but for now that's when they get this for last but not least I'm going to get a quick spritz of the indicator makeup setting spray to my face and we'll all right so here we have the finished look I actually just talk a little bit of gloss on my lips this is the Anasazi I Beverly Hills runway red lip gloss I just thought i would put it on so I never ever too glossy bold lips I'm very uncomfortable with it so i thought why not step out of my comfort zone and try a little ghouls um keep in mind that for this look you do not have to use false lashes if you're not comfortable false lashes if you never do saw flashes you do not need false lashes to complete this look just coating your own lashes with some mascara and giving them a curl will be more than enough the thing that really makes this look glamorous and festive is definitely the gold glitter liner and the bold red lips combined so I really hope that you guys enjoy this video and if you

going on I love you so much thanks for watching and I'll season I hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a tiny Jenner inspired makeup tutorial when I had my Rihanna inspired makeup look a while back i asked you guys what celebrity would like to see next and hands down kylie jenner to the cake the reason it's taking me so long to get around to building this tutorial is because for the last couple of months i have actually been formulating a lipstick inspired by kylie jenner her lip color is just like crazy in the makeup world and the beauty industry people are just loving that the color and going bonkers over and so many people have been asking me what little combination i think it is what color I think it is and I thought to myself you know what I'm gonna figure this out so let's create one that's exactly what I did I tend to withdraw automatic and we created a kind of general inspired lip color I did the entire process I was so thinking about the formulation I was so good about the color that's why it took me such a long time and so so happy to introduce this color to you guys it is called 1995 and in the shade that I was wearing in my Instagram post with mr. in California last week and I am so excited to finally have this launch because it's been a long time coming so it is going live on your cosmetics website right now this video is going up so i will link it down below for you guys to go check out if you guys know Kylie Jenner is or if you don't like her that's fine no big deal this makeup look at simple gorgeous on everybody I don't think I've ever gonna make a book so Universal on my channel for add this one is what I saw so many requests to do a makeup makeup look inspired by her I literally went to Instagram and stop this girl like boom screenshot probably 0 pictures so basically took all these pictures like a true stalker compile them into one makeup look at that I came up with right here that I believe is going to be extremely universal no matter what skin tone about what I color you can rock this look it is completely mapped from beginning to end there's no shimmer on the look what so ever and i personally love sugar I love to look dewy so the fact that i like this everybody's gonna like this because I never want to look Matt and I'm shocked by how much I love it I keep looking at them here on my I just love this it takes me back to the nineties and i love the 90 that's why I mean this lipstick 1995 because I just love the nineties i love the 90 style and he's grunge that music I just love it hope you guys enjoy this lipstick that I created thanks so much for watching this video and if you want to see you how to get this kylie jenner inspired makeup look then just keep watching bye guys i'm going to be using that whole lot more concealer to prime my eyes in the shade nw20 i'm going to go in with makeup geek purely naked who looks like this has just a little bit of sugar in it not too much though where it's not going to get in the way we're blending in our crease - very useful neutral brown color I'm going to take on a Bigfoot fluffy brush this is a e 40 from sigma i'm going to dust that in my crease area i'm also the resume you it because let's get real I know you want to see this bad boy up close yeah I am initially when i pick up that pigment starting on the outer edge so that that is the most intense and once there's not much product on the brush I'll bring it in work so this color is light i'm just going to blend it upward towards that brow area but i do not have very much and I rushed right now I'm just blending so we don't have any any harsh lines i am going to go in with a more d eyeshadow in the shade number 2 it looks like this it is not a really warm or really cool eyeshadow it's right in between so it's a nice neutral shade and i love the tone of it is it's got some depth so we're going to take that on a smaller more precise timing brush and we're going to put that in the full crease area and yes these are more the eyeshadows the ones i was talking about my last video there are only two dollars a pop yes please so I'm going to start this outer corner I'm going to push it in that area and i'm going to bring around all the way about right here i'm not gonna bring it all the way and i'm going to bring it about right there and then blended back and forth on the actual lip because at this point i'm only working in the crease on the actual lid you can really just kind of bring this down however you want but I don't want the lid to be as dark as the crease area i want the main product to be right here in this section and then a little bit can come down this little area that's fine ok now I'm going to clean brush this isn't a 25 from sigma and then just with absolutely no products on it go over that entire crease area because we need to lend so now i'm going to go in and do my eyeliner and i'm going to use Maybelline eye studio gel liner in the shade black black I'm going to use an e 65 right by mu by Sigma this is my favorite eyeliner brush and just the perfect all angles nice and petite so what kinda typically does her eyeliner and she does a little wing and then she keeps it nice and bold on the outer corner and then trimmed it down really quickly and it ends right in this area where the eyelashes start to thin out so i'm going to show you exactly how to do that and what you're going to start with is the inner corner you're going to trace it right along the eyelashes i do much can't talk while I'm doing this because I'm talking my eyes moving it has to be really precise so i'll see you in a show you ok so as you can see i have literally just like dab right at the lash line and all i have created is just the finish line ever on my lash line and you honestly can't really tell that huge difference from the side to that I that's what we're going to start off with and now we're going to create the wing and once we follow it and we connect it to this little line that we have it will come together beautifully let's hope and I do have an eyeliner video that's kind of old something walking through this right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to follow the bottom lash out of my I up to towards the corner of my eye brow write like this and that is going to be the exact line i'm going to draw for my little wing them doing just like that so that line literally it goes from bottom lash line towards the brow that's exactly how you follow that and then if you do that on both eyes your wings will always be even so now i'm going to go ahead and connect the dots i'm going to be using the last of the Rimmel lash accelerator this is my favorite drugstore mascaras and I really really like it to curl my lashes before i go in with false lashes just because i think it makes a nice and long and separated and your lashes don't get in the way of your falsies sometimes using these two volumizing your lashes they can be too chunky and they can really stand out laying against your balls lashes so literally cannot decide which one should I want to wear these are both from house of lashes this one is called Bambi and these are called siren and I love them both and i do not know which one I want to do I'm kind of leaning towards Bambi ok so i have decided on Bambi my gosh these are so much fine all I'm doing is going out with the same gel liner that using the first place I'm just going over the band of that latches to cover it up I never liked to see the band of my false lashes even though it's obvious these are false I don't make them look even more faults and they need to look in the first place if you notice it so now i'm going to move arms my skin Kylie usually seems to have renounced looking is getting you know it's obvious that she's wearing foundation she's just not kicking it on and she typically is all mad that's something that I've noticed about her look is it is very rare that she does any sort of highlight the only highlight she will do is I can under i highlight with her concealer but it's still mad so I wanted to do a foundation that is not going to be doing whatsoever or give me a glow and make it forever is that foundation for me if your oily make it forever is going to probably make you a little doing but since I'm already so dry this is not going to make me look do you whatsoever i'm gonna look completely matte foundation will go sweets color so it works good I'm really going to spread this all over my face so that it's not too heavy so I'm going to a light application a foundation you can totally see my skin on using the camera but I can still see my little freckles and my blemishes but now i'm going to go in with nars radiant creamy concealer i'm using the shade custard and i'm going to apply this under my eye area i'm going in with a damn you wonder it's gonna make you more sure okay i'm going to just set that under eye concealer i'm going to be using the Anasazi of banana shade from her contour palette and I'm also been using mac and besides as always mix those together before this look I'm mainly using the anastacio banana shades and i'm just going to set this entire under eye area ok so now i'm going to go ahead and fill in my brows normal i am not in any way to try to replicate or duplicate had dinners I drive you completely different browse and i'm not going to go to come that road so I'm going to fill them in like I normally would one brown John wanted to go ok so now i'm going to shade mylar by Mac it looks like this right here it's a really really light shade have a pearlescent to it it's not shimmer and not Sparkle were just as a nice lean to it it just kind of reflects the light it's hard to explain it's a beautiful color very very neutral basic i'm going to use this to highlight underneath the brow bone because whatever she is using up there is extremely natural pretty much like she is nothing but i can see there's a little something i'm going to use that same I large touch on that inner corner for a really natural inner corner highlight i'm going to take a touch of black i'm using make a geek corrupt and I using i'm going to eat 15 black liner brush by Sigma i'm going to take this on that outer corner right here and match it up to that wing wire that we did earlier and just press it into that lash line only in the outer corner like that I'm going to go back with more key eyeshadow in the shade 62 i'm going to use that to blend out this under eye area I'm going to buff that back and forth i'm going to be doing is bronze in my face because she really doesn't do much blush for faces look very natural just a little bit of color is touching the skin so i'm going to be using agar lactic map bronzer and shade Cabo start blending you I have never used this product before so this has been my first we'll see how it goes oh my god this bronzer is Georgina oh and the brush I'm using to apply this is by tom for I I can't talk about it don't don't ask okay it just looks so beautiful and it's way too expensive and i bought it anyways now I'm in love it was an impulse purchase and I'm sorry so last but not least we get to move on to the famous kylie jenner lip color and like I mentioned the beginning of the video i did create a lipstick inspired by the general lip color I am a very part of this lip color is taking a while because i was so ultra picky i kept getting it and sending it back like note too pigmented around to me - mom - Rosie Super Bowl i'm going to put on right now for you guys without any lip liner if you do choose to use the wire I would suggest using macworld pencil which I've heard and read that that is the lip liner that her makeup artist does use on Kylie and world is going to go perfect with this I made it so that it had like the world color is in this lipstick so I absolutely love this show you exactly how it looks smells super dry right now to let me more starting to look really quick and then i'll try this for you so there you have it that is 1995 and 95 only on my little right now with no lip liner I just move those colors so much seriously I'm not just saying that because I created it I love this color i will link down below it is going live on drugs cosmetics website today so i would go ahead i'll put the link down below if you guys want to go check out 1995 i will also put this compost that down there for you guys as well we'll get twenty-five percent off i believe my discount code is just Jacqueline about put it down below and that will pay you a decent amount of money and you unless you want to pay full price that's up to you and I mean you just one last tip if you want to make your lips with a little bit fuller take just a bronzer i'm going to use the bronzer use or dark eyeshadow something that matters have any shimmer on a blending brush and then just lightly put it underneath that bottom one just ever so slightly and that bring it down a little bit now that we don't watch on a rock brush and that creates a natural shadow making it look like that bottom lip is kind of folding over and make that a little slumber this is a look very up close I will be honest with you I was not expecting to actually like this look on me as much as I do I really hope that you guys enjoyed this tutorial as always thank you so much for watching hey guys so today I'm going to be doing this natural glam makeup look for you and what I mean by natural lamb is we are going to be working with all neutral tones but it is still a glamorous look so this is a full face of makeup it is not like a five-minute natural makeup when you're running out the door it is a full face but instead of focusing on like dramatic winged liner or intense contour we're really going to be focusing on keeping everything soft and feminine and blurred out the point of this look is to really make it look like you are just glowing from within and just enhancing your natural beauty this is very on trend right now you see tons of celebrities wearing this look and tons of celebrity makeup artist wearing and doing this look right now so i just wanted to make a video showing you how you can achieve it for yourself every single person watching this video can do this look and it will look good on you and I can promise you that and it is so easy to achieve anybody can do this so I really hope that you enjoy this video as always i love you guys so much and I'll be seeing you soon all right guys the first thing I'm doing is throwing my hair up so that we are not distracted by it hanging all in my face we are going to be starting off with the skin today so i am going to prime my face using L'Oreal magic Lumi this is a light diffusing primer and went to warm it up on my fingertips and pressed it into my skin pressing primer and your skin will help with the longevity and make it work much better then we're going in with lush feeling younger this is a skin tent it is absolutely beautiful full it reflects light in all the right ways you can put on before foundation during foundation or after oh we are absolutely in love so i'm going to apply this all the cheekbones some of the forehead and chin wherever you want light to reflect then we are going in with a new foundation you guys are actually the ones who told me that i need this in my life and you are correct so this is the Chanel left Lumiere it is such a beautiful medium to full coverage foundation and i'm going to use as always my Sigma f80 kabuki brush and as you can see i am pressing this into the skin once again like we press the primer into the skin this will just help it lasts the longest and will give a nice dewy glow so just pressing all over the face as you can see it's a little bit darker but it does match my neck which is what I want to match then we are going in with mac pro longwear concealer and i'm using shape and w20 i'm just going to dab this on the skin with my fingers going all the way back toward the temple area and then grabbing the sigma f 86 brush and blending this out this is not technically a concealer brush but I just recommend everyone uses it for concealer because it is absolutely beautiful don't forget to also run over the eyes to prime the eyes for the shadow that we will be going in with I also slightly go over my eyebrows it doesn't really matter but it can help to prime the eyebrows as well speaking of brows boom done I did use the anastacio caramel and ash blonde to fill in and then I'm going to go and sculpt again with that mac pro longwear concealer i will put my full brow tutorial down below in the description bar as always for you I just like stopped in my brows out like the way it looks just having a little bit more defined and other intense right now but it will all work out using the anastacio contour contour kit in the banana shade we're already hit pan and the mac pro emphasize powder what can i say some things never changed i'll be using this powder forever using the Sigma taper highlighting brush I'm going to dab as you can see literally dabbing motions I really prefer dabbing when i'm setting my concealer as opposed to rubbing and sweeping it really presses the powder into the skin and keep the concealer in place all day long I've never had an issue with my concealer breaking up at all then going in with the mac this is mac mineralize loose powder who can remember that for a second i'm going to just dab this almighty zone because i have an issue with my makeup breaking up in my t zone because I make so many facial expressions who would have thought then I'm going to kick it old school and use mac soft brown today for my eyes i'm going in with a sigma e40 brush which is just a big fat blending brush and I'm going all the way from inner corner to outer corner as you can see i'm not putting it all over the lid I am starting deep down the crease and working my way up so we're just going to blend blend blend and don't forget to practice patience while blending because it's definitely going to come in handy so just keep going all the way from air corner and our corner making it as dark as you please I've also done this look using a bronzer instead of an eye shadow and it's just as beautiful then we're going with mac texture its a Mac day what can i say who . for me for that right I'm going again and inner corner and the outer corner as you can see i'm leaving the ball of the eye blank you don't have to you can just continue to get this all over the eyelid but i'm just leaving the center of my eye with not much on it just focusing on the inner and outer corner and then make sure you go back and blend that out once again against again blend blend blend blend blend then we are going in with becca highlighter in opal haha I've been seeing the praises of this highlighter for a while now i just love it you can use any brush I'm using them - 52 brush tapping this all over the center of that lid which is why I left it blank and then as you come to the outer parts just start to lightly blend it out word once you don't have as much payment on that brush using mac fix plus i'm going to just dampen the brush to make it more intense you can use eye drops for this water won't really work but I drops will you can wet any shimmery eyeshadow max don't work but any shimmery eyeshadow will become more metallic and give more of a finish or a foiled application when you wet it with 6 plus i'm sadly not right on the center just for a little bit more intensity than going in with mac nylon such a beautiful highlight it's a yellow base make sure you are right handed with it because it is a very very intense highlight but as you can see it's absolutely gorgeous so just a tiny bit will go a very long way you can see i absolutely love love love this highlight and I'm going to curl my lashes very lightly and yes very lightly because we are going to use false lashes so you want to make sure that curl is not too intense otherwise it's going to be very hard to get false lashes on i am putting a coat of giorgio armani eyes to kill this is still my sample size , himself says i love it then we are going to pop on a pair of lashes these are bias quito they are mean clashes which looks so natural beautiful it is not always easy to wear false lashes without eyeliner but if you get it close enough to that lash line and you're very patient you can do it and it will look beautiful as you can see I'm squeezing just to make sure that there's no separation and boom beautiful just make sure that you get those tweezers in there and really squeeze that fall / with that natural lash obviously be aware of your skin but it will just keep it super super low so that you don't have any separation between your naturals and your falsies then we are going to just go in with any pencil brush and blending texture underneath that island starting in the outer corner i always like to start in the outer corner because i like the most intensity to be in the outer corner if you don't want the most intense thing at a corner you can start in the inner corner just once again don't forget to blend so many clients for the past few years have always had issues with their under eye area because they just don't like to spend time under blending so just don't give up keep blending back and forth constantly and I was going in with a smaller more precise brush just putting more of that texture shape just more densely up in those lashes just to fill them in so there's no gaps or separation then in the inner corner going in with nylon again just highlight you can see this highlight is moving so we have the highlight on the inner corner follow the eye and on the brow bone so those three areas of highlight on the I really are very flattering on everyone then going in with nar's long wearing eyeliner and rue bonaparte which is this beautiful nude that I go back to every single spring and summer i'm going to just line my waterline i'm not going to show you me doing this for a very long time just because my allergies have been off the chain and my eyes are so red right now I really don't watch myself to this forever either moving on we're going to just mascara the lower lashes and I feel like it's very important to put on a generous amount of mascara on the lower lashes when doing a look like this with a nude liner and the waterline and false lashes and sneeze them eyeliner ruined a whole sad day so i'm going to show you how we can clean this up wait about 40 to 60 seconds and then get a q-tip and just wipe and literally it will just come off like a chalkboard like it never even happened do not try to take off any one mascara or eyeliner wait until it's dry then going on with Studio care blend pressed powder this is in shade medium deep because I'm pretty fair right now I'm going to grab a big that brush I don't know the number of this one I will listed below for you and I'm going to bronze the face we are not doing any contouring we are just bronzing but it's pretty much the exact same thing is contouring just not precise so we're just going to bronze the cheeks right underneath the cheekbone area on the temples around the forehead bottom part of the chin we just want to give a really beautiful sunkissed glow to the entire face make sure you don't put a lot on your forehead or knows you want to leave that area blank so just the outer part then kicking it old school going in with mac peaches blush if you guys have been a loyal follower of mine from the beginning you know I used to be obsessed with matt peaches I actually think I've gone through three of these blushes which is the most i've ever gone through a blush all my years working at mac i put this on everyone who walked into the store so I'm going to blend this with a mac 129 into my bronzer going backward even though it doesn't even though it doesn't have a sheen or shimmer in it it really gives a beautiful glow to the face compliments so many people everyone thinks it looks scary in person until you put it on it is such a gorgeous color I use it every spring and summer moving on going back with the Bekaa highlighter and opal we are going to use be Sigma taper highlighter brush once again and just dust this all over the top of that cheekbone bringing up to the side kind of by the eyebrow that will get a really beautiful glow especially when you're turning your face from side to side make sure that you do a light amount of this you do not want to be too generous with this because it is a very intense highlighter and it on the chin Cupid's bow and of course in the center of that knows you do not have to do all that if you don't look super glowy but I love lighting up like a disco ball then we're going in with anastacio clear brow gel just so that are brown hairs are not flapping all over our face throughout the day because my will fall and look a hot mess and there's this there's just nothing worse ok really first world problems then we're going to go in with mac Japanese maple i am using all my old staples today I just love love this color it is such a beautiful nude and you can finish it like this and just do a super new lip which of course totally gorge but instead we are going to go on top of that with the new mac mineralize gloss and be nice which is such a pretty coral rosy shade I absolutely love these formulas they're such great losses so just mixing that is going to be a nice glossy nude coral shade absolutely perfect so that completes our look I hope you guys enjoy thank you so much for watching i love you all so much and I'll see hello my love today's video isn't making sure how many lives are going to change before embarrassing myself in front of thousands of people moving a lot today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look that i am wearing right here and I'm super excited for today's video because it isn't all affordable makeup look which I am very very excited about the only thing that I kind of skipped over was the brows i use the Anasazi of Broadway's but I figured you guys would forgive me because you know how it is with the brows it's like don't mess with the brown I saw recently a ton of requests on like two videos ago for an affordable or drugstore makeup look so I was like let's do it i also saw your quest incorporating cool tones into a smoky eye so we did that as well which is very outside of my comfort zone let me just say when I was going in with the cool tones in my crease like because I always work with neutrals or warms all myself because I just don't love cool tones on me but I actually do like this look right now I really like how it turned out so I am comfortable with this and i also saw a time of you guys asking for me to work with the jaclyn hill favorites palette that I design with more feet last December so I thought I would bring that back for this video so we're doing cool toward the jackal favorites palette and we're doing an affordable look at one video so I'm trying to me as many requests as possible if you don't own this palette don't worry they sell the shadows individually for two dollars a piece so I will go ahead and list them down below for you guys at which ones i am using so if you do want to purchase these you can go ahead and purchase the exact same colors that are in this palette for yourself online so don't feel like left out because you don't have this gallery thing like that you know saying I also want to say really quickly that i use in the elf blush palette today for the first time ever a subscriber recommended this me so I immediately went out and bought it a couple of days ago and you guys have seen me use this palette which is the morphe 9b palette I I love this palette I don't just love this palette for its affordability I can't look at this palette say oh yeah it's good for the price like no this palette is just good like these blushes are good they're pigmented their blendable they're soft I love them but i wanted to try something different today because I just got these a couple days ago and I was really excited to try them i will say they're just as pigmented as the morphe brushes the only difference is the more key ones have a little bit more blendabilities there a little bit creamier but other than that they had the same pigment on so the more he was gonna be easier to work with but still if you're looking for a great inexpensive blush palette to grab at your local drugstore this alpha one was really good i just want to mention that before jumping into the video because this was my first time using this and so that's like my little baby mini review on it i hope you guys enjoy this video and if you do get a big thumbs up and please subscribe i love you guys so much you know i mean it and i'll see you soon alright so first thing we're going to do today is prime our face i'm using the Loreal light infusing a primer this is my favorite drugstore primer because i am very dry so this helps give me like a radiant glow to the skin and makes the foundation glide on just a little bit easier and today for foundation I'm going to be mixing the original Lori true l'oreal true match and the L'Oreal True Match Lumi i'm using shade w4 and both foundations the original one is just a little bit too dry for me but the looming one can be very luminous so I want to mix them together to kinda get the best of both worlds so I am using a more p.m. for 39 foundation brush as always to blend this into the skin and this is a very affordable foundation brush as well if you're looking for a good one this one is bomb now i'm going to going in with concealer and i am using the Maybelline master concealer i really really like this concealer I am blending it out with a real techniques sponge which is basically the same thing as a Beauty Blender but again it's more affordable and i love this I've been choosing it over my beauty blender for the past month it's super big one side having a flat side and the other side is like a point is you can really get up in the corner of your eyes and blend everything out so fat and squishy and i love it now i'm going to go in with a next highlight and contour kit and i'm going to be using a more p.m. for 38 brush to use these two middle shades together on the under eye area just to set my concealer i normally use the anastacio powder and the map emphasize but these do the exact same thing and they did a great job so I'm just going to be blending that out on the entire under eye area and then i will also put that on the island as well so that my shadows blend a little bit better now i'm going to be going in with the morphe jaclyn hill favorites palette which is so like awkward to say that but anyways i am using this kind of medium tone warmish neutral brown that you saw all the way to the left side the palette i will put the exact numbers and names down below for you guys if you don't own this palette and i am using a sigma e40 to dust this all over in the crease area I like to initially go in with a neutral or a warm shade because if I go in was just nothing but cool colors you can sometimes look like I've been punched in the eye so I always like to start with kind of a peachy warm or neutral base to blend everything out and then pack on the cool shade on top of that i'm going to go in with the first cool tone brown right here and I'm going to be using a what is this more fee and 433 brush to apply this in my crease area I'm going to go all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner I'm going to keep this as low as possible because again i do want to bring this too high up because that's when you're i can start to look a little bruise when working with cool tones so I keep this really low and that crease as you can see i'm really hollowing out back and forth and then once there's less product on the Block brush i will begin to blend upward in that warm color to kind of combine the both of them into a neutral shade now i'm going to go in with an even duck cool tone brown which is the one right next to the one that we just picked up and using the exact same brush I'm going to do the same step right in the crease of my eye I'm going to go back and forth and really carve out this crease area if you do not have a defined crease and that's okay you can create one and do the same step and full people that you have a deep set crease even if you don't that's the beauty of makeup if i seemed distracted or i'm laughing I'm looking around I'm talking it's because my mom is in the room she was on the phone and she had on speaker so i could be a part of the conversation but I'm like I'm still filming even if you're going to be behind the camera so that's why I seem a little distracted at times anyways once you don't have as much product on you brush you want to blend upward that is like the biggest part and blending out your shadow and making it really seamless now we're going to grab the shade right next to those are the two Browns that we've been using this whole time which is kind of a neutral kind of cool tone sandy brown that's how I'm describing it and any synthetic brush will do to pack this on the lid i'm going to go over a couple of times to really make that color a little bit brighter if you want to spray your brush with some fix+ that would be great you want to I actually tried spreading my brush with the law real makeup setting spray and it just was not having it at all it was not it didn't have glitter in it so it wasn't really sticking and giving that metallic look but you could use eye drops and that would also wet your brush and it would give it a little bit more sticking power if you want your eyes to really listen so now i'm going to go in with lore'l smoldering eyeliner this is a creamy Cole liner and i am going to just put this all over the lash line as you can see I'm not really trying to make it perfect but I want to keep it more on the thin side and right on the lash line and then I'll take any sort of small definer brush and just very lightly kind of smoke that out i don't want to be too smoky though but i just wanted to be a soft liner not to black not too intense not too smoky which is a little bit of definition on the lashes so that we don't leave the lash line completely blank but I didn't want to do like a dramatic cat I today now i'm filling in the brows as always and I am just using the Anasazi or browse in the shade hope I tried the I think it's by NYX the NYX brow pencil I think maybe was NYC and it was just so hard to use I just stuck with the Anastasio one that one which is super dry i don't know if i got like a dud and if they're usually good but it just wasn't working for me so I just stuck to what I know so that I didn't mess up his eyebrows so I go a lot lighter on the inner corner and then I go much heavier on the outer tail and I just blend it all out with the spoolie now we're going to go in with lashes and i'm using house of lashes in the style siren these are very fluffy and I refer to them as daytime lashes but for some they are not daytime lashes but they're very fluffy and very beautiful without being really over the top and dramatic so I am using the Loreal voluminous mascara and carbon black and I'm only putting this mascara on the very base of the ashes and the reason I do this is because it really helps blend the lashes with your fake ones but at the same time I don't want to take it up all the way out all the lashes because it can really kill the longevity of wearing these lashes multiple times not to mention it can make them look noticeably fake so i just do it at the very root and base of the lashes now i'm going to mix the two highlighting shade from this palette 1 it has a little bit of a pinky undertone and the other one has a little bit of a yellow undertone so I mix them together to make it a little bit more neutral and using any synthetic brush just pop this at the high point of the brow bone and then blend it down along the tale of the brow if you want more of a natural daytime look you can skip this but you know me I'm always going to add the drama for you so that you can see how it looks now using the same a l'oreal smoldering eyeliner I'm just going to align my entire water line because we are going to smoke this out a little bit and once I've done that I'm going to go in with this really super dark brown has a little bit of a purple undertone in it for the lower lash line any definer brush i'm just going to pack this really tightly up against that lower water line so that the black liner and this doc brown can kind of mix together and become its own little special cocktail and then using a pencil brush I'm going to blend out the whole lower lash line all the way back and forth i always suggest putting a light brown shade on the pencil brush because it'll really help get that lower lash line nice and seamlessly blended and then basic where it's going to go in and apply some mascara to the lower lashes again i am using the Loreal voluminous and carbon black because i like my lashes black just like my heart but I couldn't resist i'm sorry i'm going to be bronzing my face and I'm using the morphe for brush to apply the jane bronzing powder and a shade inspire love this brush and love this bronzer these two together are amazing i think this bronzer is so great it's so blendable it's very light so I like that it's not orange and i like that i actually have to pack it on to get some color because you can sometimes go overboard bronzer right and you're like whoa why does it look like I have an orange blob on my face or it can look muddy but this one you really have to pack it on to get the shade to show up which I kind of appreciate because you won't go overboard to easily so it's going to blend that out all around the cheek area down on the job on the forehead the temples basically everywhere except the center of the face and i'm going to go in with my blush palette and this is by elf and this is in the shade dark they have a light one and a dark one and i'm using the doc one and i'm going to mix these two shades together one is like a raspberry any other one is a pink you can see how pigmented this is it is like it's pigmented and i'm using that exact same p for brush my morphe to blend this out and i'm really going to make sure i work at blending this out because it is really pigmented they aren't that crazy blendable but that's okay because they're so pigmented that my group worth it so now i'm going to make these to highlight shades in the Knicks highlight and contour palette and I'm using the morphe and 501 brush to apply this and look how pretty this highlight turned out it's so pretty I mean it's definitely white it's not like a champagne color or a gold color but i just think that it's such a beautiful highlight shade so i'm going to put a little bit out on my chin and a tiny bit of it on the side of my nose and really blend that out so we can get a nice glow going on because you know strobing is all the thing of this fall so I'm now going to line my lips using the revlon colorstay lip liner in the shade chocolate which this color does not like chocolate to me right like it looks like such a berry fault I'm shade it doesn't like chocolate but that's okay any lip liner will work i'm going to go with a super super dark lip but i just wanted to line my lips because this is going to kind of act as a base to keep the lipstick that we're going to put on next in place so it doesn't slide all over our face and now i'm going to go in with an oldie but a goodie and this is revlon black cherry any of my OG subscribers will remember this from like the first six months that i was on youtube so i thought we would bring it back so after that this look is complete I hope you guys enjoy this look thank you so much for watching I love you and I'll see hey guys for today's video I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look right here using the man emu a make it palette he's already got like obsessed I love you have I'm all right anyway so for today's video I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look right here I kind of Drew some inspiration on this look from my last video because there was such a high request for a makeup tutorial on that look um but I didn't want to do that exact look for you so instead what i did is i recreated that look with the mani and you a palette that he created with makeup geek and I am so excited to finally be holding this and I'm so happy for Manny I'm so excited for Manny I'm so proud of many I'm just it's awesome to see this come together and I first time I ever watched many the first video ever saw his he said in that video like oh my god could you imagine if i collaborated make one day I would just die and it's so funny because when you're later these collaborative makeup geek and it's like it's so cool it's just it's so cool so I'm really happy for him hair its just oh cool I'm gonna stop talking follow me if you want to get updates on the palate it's sold out currently but it will be restocked i believe next week he said but follow his social media to get you keep you guys updated on all social I'm sure so yeah it's not backing and coming to the video thanks for watching i love you and I'll see you soon I I wouldn't room Annie fashion if you don't like it please don't watch it I mean it's not exactly how he says it but you know I'm trying to be a lady here on my channel hm you know I am a quick disclaimer my spray tan is bad this is not cute on my wrist so throughout the video orange hands orange everything uh it's not good so I want to throw that out there yes I'm aware this rate as bad it's not a good situation all right let's do this thingy first things first I'm going to prime my eyes and I'm going to be using the Too Faced shadow insurance I typically use a concealer and then set it with powder for my eye primer which I actually do prefer but for some reason i was just i don't know i was in a mood and I was like you know what we're going to do this today so that's what I did now i'm going to be going in with the man emu a and makeup geek eyeshadow palette and I'm going to be grabbing beaches in cream right here top Center taking any fluffy brush that you love and you trust and you have a long-term committed relationship with going to go in and just blend that out all the way from the outer corner to the inner corner as you can see beaches and cream pretty much doesn't show up on me especially when I have a spray tan like I do right now I'm still gonna throw it in there just for good faith and it'll help blend out the next colors I'm going to be mixing sora and frappe and I'm going to do the exact same thing as i do with peaches and cream i'm going to take these two colors and i'm going to go from inner corner to outer corner all the way back and forth and windshield wiper motions I'm putting the heaviest of the pigment right there in the crease of my eye if you do not have a crease in your eye you can just create one just pick a place and go back and forth and windshield wiper motions and then whatever is left over on my brush I will just lightly kind of blend upward as you see me doing right now but I don't have barely any pigment on my brush at that point now i'm going to mix Mars and Aphrodite Mars is like a really intense kind of reddish raspberry and Aphrodite is a really kind of beautiful true deep dark brown I'm going to mix those two together to get almost like the color of like chocolate cherries i want to say I'm going to take again any fluffy brush that you love this is the more p.m. 4 3 3 i'm going to keep this a little bit lower than I did with the first shade since it is so dark and i'm really gonna go heavy in the crease itself as you can see I'm being very sloppy on the lid because i don't care how that looks I'm not gonna worry about blending that out because i'm going to cover that up with another shade in just a few moments I'm only going to worry about blending out the top area in the crease so i will go back with another fluffy brush which is a little bit more of either frappe or saw just any light brown you could grab beaches and cream and we're just going to go over that area nice and slow and very soft just to slightly blend out those edges without making them come too high or look too jagged now i'm going to pick up cosmopolitan which is a really beautiful kind of Rosie golden shade and grabbing a mac 242 brush I did wet my brush a little bit with fix plus i'm going to begin just to put this all over the entire lid and at first I was like do I only one purpose in the inner corner and kind of fade out I wasn't quite sure but then I ended up doing a really intense it almost creates like a an illusion of a cut crease because I want my brush and I made it so metallic i'm going to really use this brush to make it really intense so my lid color is just strictly cosmopolitan and then that darker chocolate cherry shade is just strictly in the crease so that's what i decided to do with that and then I packed on glitter later I just love the way it all came together I'm going and just making it a little bit darker in the crease area because I just thought that it is a little bit more extra what I had on cosmopolitan now for liner i am using the Maybelline gel liner I swear to god you guys like this is still my favorite gel liner is my favorite gel liner forever like nothing compares to it everything smudges nothing lasts nothing is as black as I wanted to be like this is the most bomb liner ever and it's from the drugstore you can get a walgreens CVS alta it's my favorite gel liner of all time so i am doing a wing but I'm going to keep it a little on the thin side this is at least 10 for me because i love a big huge intense whoa I like a big intense thick week but I'm going to keep this one small so I'm going to go in with a little bit of the two-faced glitter glue this is my absolute favorite way to apply glitter it's the best glitter glue out there it doesn't separate it doesn't like it really is super glue for glitter it keeps on your eyes it's not going to fall off throughout the night it really does stay in place it's a gorilla glue for your eyeshadow it's amazing so I will pack it on with a brush and I'll grab glitter and almost immediately pack the glitter on right over top of it you want to make sure you do it fairly quickly because once the glue dries it doesn't serve the same purpose you want that glue to still be tacky on the lid when you're packing on the glitter and since I am packing on so much glitter by the way i'm using eye candy glitter in the shade taffie such a gorgeous color it's like a rose gold kind of coppery pink it went perfect with this I look this is the same girl I was also wearing in my last video because a lot of you guys were asking so i will find it link it down below for you I'm just covering up my eyeliner again so i don't have a glitter all over my liner because that is definitely a pet peeve of mine is when you have glitter all over the liner so I always make sure to cover that up on myself and then i'm going to pop on some lashes and i'm using flutter lashes and the style Ashley these are such a cool ash they're like very wispy very long but yet they're not super duper thick so you can still see through them and see the eyeshadow look if you know what I'm saying now i'm going to prime my skin and i'm using this ridiculously bougie YSL primer um I don't know the exact name of it but again i find it below I'll find it all this if you guys down below but it's a blurring primer it's my second time using it and i really like it we're gonna kick it old school with the giorgio armani a luminous silk foundation i am using the morphe and 439 foundation brush to apply this I swear this foundation is just so good like if you've been around my channel for a while you know this was pretty much a foundation I use for a solid eight months and I haven't used it in a long time have been trying to foundations I went back to this one and I'm just like oh I missed you so much it's just such a good foundation i forgot how much I loved it so then for concealer i'm going to you know just past the entire bottle on my face no big deal i'm going to be using the Urban Decay a weightless naked concealer this like i said before my favorite concealer of all time I have gone everyone addicted to it i've got my mom addicted I've got my sister I've got my friends I've got my cousins I've got everybody to do this concealer I swear works for everyone i know it's so beautiful it is so weightless it doesn't get a crazy mess it's not too oily it's not too creamy it's it's it's the most beautiful concealer ever I swear like urban decay has like some voodoo going on in their lives because they created the most incredible concealer of all time so i am putting that under my eyes forehead nose and a little on the chin and I'm going to grab the anastacio banana powder and I'm going to pack that wherever I put the concealer so i use a pretty light amount and I am blending out with a really really fluffy brush this is the e3 it's part of the more feet Elite Collection and as you can see it is really yellow and the reason i like that is because it's going to help - really bright in my face and especially once i put on bronzer it'll just kind of pull the whole look together everything will look nice and light and fresh now we're going to go in and contour using my favorite contour powder and my favorite contour brush this is my favorite way of contouring as far as the brush goes this is the m5 23 brush my morphe i am obsessed i think it's the most amazing contour brush I used to love the NARS e21 and now this has taken over my holy grail because it just makes it softer and more blendable and easy to apply it's just it's beautiful and then for the actual powder i'm using Mac shade stir you can find on mac cosmetics calm and I realized the center of my forehead was looking dingy and dirty so I grabbed a little bit of that Anastasio banana powder and i lightened it up my face looks really like because i was so dark like darkly spray-tanned but once everything oxidizes in like 30 minutes I will get a little bit darker my face will match my body a little bit more I'm going to grab the rcn day and no color powder and i'm going to just put this right there going from the corner of my lip to the corner of the top of my ear not quarters right corner of my lip to the top of my tea i'm going to make a line going to let that sit while I finish my makeup and then it will just sharpen my contour got it from the brows what you gotta do when you see that extra hair grow and just get rid of it I do not suggest is going in with scissors to your browse by the way if you haven't done it before like first go to a professional don't chop off your browser ladies my best friend literally took scissors to her eyebrows when she was 12 years old it was the saddest thing ever oh my god girl i still feel for you i'm filling in my brows using the Anasazi a brow definer i feel this is the only black pencil never going to use for the rest of my life I'm so obsessed that makes it so quick and easy and then i'm going to go in and grab the highlighting shade from the man emu a pallet and this is the color artemis on the kind of its kinda reminds me of mac nylon in a sense it's a really beautiful highlight and it's got a little bit like a yellow sheet and it's gorgeous so I'm going to pack a little bit of that only the high point of the brow and then a teeny tiny bit on the very inner corner of the eye just to keep things kind of nice and bright and I'm going to grab a frappe and then and just any pencil brush and I'm going to just run this over the lower lash line I want this to be darkest and most intense on the very outer corner that's just a personal preference for me though that has nothing to do with the look that's just the way I like it on my eye shape is i like it to be the darkest and I get to come down the lowest on the outer corner of the eye that I'm grabbing a little bit of Aphrodite I didn't show a shot of it but that's what i'm doing right now is that super dark brown and then pack that on super super tight to my lashline like literally in my lashes on my lash line as close as possible and then i will blend it back out with more frappe you can grab some Mars and go in and blend that out if you want to make it a little more rise Barry under there that's totally up to you and then I'm going to grab mac cosmetics fascinating i call this is like stark white like is white as paper it's not creamy it's not a nude it is white but i wanted to use it today to really make the colors pop and also make my eyes stand out as well then i'm going to go in with a blush and i'm using the sephora brand blush in the shade tangerine tease I was online shopping a couple weeks ago on sephora.com and I just tried a couple of these i bought some of them because I've never tried before brand blush and some of them i don't really love but this one I think is really really beautiful it's got some nice shimmer and it's a beautiful coral i'm going to go ahead and just erase that bacon if you will to reveal a nice shot contour if this is too sharp for you totally understandable go back with your contour brush ever so lightly and just lightly go over it and it will make it a little bit more buff out but I'm going to keep it nice and sharp girl i'm going to go in with this malli face and cheek palette i discovered this because of kathleenlights and I'm not gonna lie i ordered on amazon for like two times the price because I'm just that kind of girl when someone's reading about something I'm like oh I have to have it i'll do i need to do to get my hands on this bad boy but can we talk about this highlight no let's just take a moment of silence for the highlight oh my god I can't breathe okay i'm gonna take that same highlight i'm going to put on the Cupid's bow this is just a little trick to make the mouth look a little bit powdery ER and i'm going to take a latte and I'm going I'm sorry frappe and i'm going to just coat that all over the bottom lip again you will see it's going to give it more of a shadow to make it look like it is fuller now i'm going to go in with mac cosmetics subculture lip pencil i just purchased this last week because this used to be my favorite lip pencil ever when i worked at mac i wore every day with every shade of knew that you can think of it was my go-to color and I just remember like why don't you use that color anymore so I jumped online and i bought it and I'm in love with it all over again it's such a good everyday lip liner like it's just the perfect color for day-to-day lips at least for me it is a great neutral and i'm going to go in with the Ariana Grande and mac cosmetics Viva Glam gloss if you guys don't know about the mac viva glam program it's amazing one hundred percent of the proceeds go to men women and children living with and affected by HIV and AIDS so it's always nice to know that your money is going to a great organization whenever you buy a Viva Glam gloss or lip sticks so last but not least I'm going to just cut my lower lashes with some mascara because i forgot to do this and I looked at myself in all right way something missing so i'm using the mac extended play mascara which is my favorite for lower lash and then this look is complete I hope you guys enjoy the video thanks so much for watching i love you and i'll see you in my next video bye guys hey guys today's video I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look that you see right here i need to come up with a different row my goodness gracious every single he got me like it's been like almost four years i think i'm still doing the same intro really rockin I am ridiculously obsessed with this makeup look I'm trying so hard not to stare at myself in the viewfinder and seem like a total narcissist because every two seconds I want to be like hmm i don't remember the last time I loved my makeup look as much as I love this one like this like filled up my cup if you know what I mean like I just feel like alive with this makeup look on and the reason I'm putting this tutorial for you guys is because i was wearing the same look a couple days ago and i was on snapchat that day and I went over to Twitter and I could not believe how many requests there were from you guys treating me to film this makeup for you guys so that is exactly what I did you know how it works so wish is my command that's how we do it around here but i did just kind of spice it up a little bit i added lashes that are a little bit more dramatic and I made my lower lashline pop just a little bit more I just feel like every time I do the same look like a second time it gets better like the first time I like it but the second time I usually love it and keep that in mind because if you try to look one time and you're not like crazy in love give it a second shot I feel like the more you do something more you can perfect it like practice makes perfect and i'm saying so yes I am so in love with this colorful liner trend I know colorful liners are really in every single spring and summer but this year it's everywhere and brands have been coming out with more colorful liners which I just love so much I've seen so many gorgeous looks with colorful liners on Instagram there was this one girl that you like a smoky black eye with a white liner is so gorgeous i saw in the popular page on Manny he recently did a makeup look using the same exact liner i think i think it was the same exact liner a couple weeks ago his look was much more subtle than this so if you want to check that out totally beautiful but yeah i'm just i'm in love with this i really wanted to a yellow liner like a yellow line would be really fun and different but i'm trying to think of how it would work i think like a turquoise like almost like sea foam we have a gorgeous like a yellow liner and I'm dying and rambling i love this look and I hope that you guys maybe get some inspiration to jump outside of your comfort zone and try something different like a weed colorful either because it's just so much fun not to mention it's like fun for everybody around you every single time you blink it's like but a nice surprise for all of your friends and family so I hope that you guys enjoy this video thanks for watching i love you and I'll see you guys soon no right please God no I don't want to get glam I want to go back to bed I'm just kidding okay i want to start by priming my eyes I'm using any concealer that's just the way i prime it i'm using a dry Beauty Blender just to blend that out you can use your finger a damp Beauty Blender a brush it doesn't matter this is just the way i prime my eyes it's what works for me after I had my entire eyelid covered with a thin amount of concealer i will just a little bit of powder over a translucent powder it can be like a setting powder it doesn't matter just anything to make it Matt and first and foremost i'm going to be going in with makeup geek chickity since we're going to be going in with reds and corals and kind of picky shades today i wanted to go in with chickadee first it is one of my favorite all-time colors for the crease when i'm doing a warm smoky eye and i am using a sigma e40 which is one of my oldies but goodies it's a great blending brush and as you can see i'm bringing it all the way to the inner corner to the outer corner and I'm keeping it very low on the entire crease area and then once i have basically no product left as you see I bring it up basically all the way towards my brow and that's how we get that really seamless blending perfection look that we want on the ice now i'm going to go in with more fiesta this is a single eyeshadow by morphy recently I'm package like every single morphy eyeshadow like a couple weeks ago and put them in pallets and so I've been kind of dabbling around them more and more and so I'm going to do the exact same thing with this that I do a chickadee and put it just directly over the first color right there in my crease then i'm going to reach for makeup geek morocco I don't know why I just discovered this eyeshadow like why have I not been using this every day of my life welcome home mama you are now a part of the family how long with this eyeshadow is so gorgeous as you can see me doing the exact same thing and bring this one down on my lid a little bit more than the rest just because i felt like it there wasn't really no rhyme or reason I was just having fun and I'm going to grab Mac red brick going to be honest you guys it is not necessary to put on four different shades of corals and oranges it is so totally not but just because this is one of my favorite colors to work with I wanted to utilize as many of my shadows as possible but honestly can do this with two or three of the shadows you do not need all of them I'm grabbing anastacio burnt orange which is such a beautiful kind of caramel camel shade if you're like a doctor all complexions would be such a beautiful shade for your transition right there in your crease for an everyday color it's so gorgeous picking up another blending brushes the morphe and 4 3 3 i'm going to do is just grab a little bit more of that makeup geek morocco and Anasazi burnt orange and just put a little bit more intense and make it a little bit deeper in my crease because i want to just a little bit more like pronunciation in the crease area so then I'm going to pick up the new tart clay pot waterproof liner and this is in the shade mint and I'm going to be applying this the exact same way that I would apply any regular basic black liner except honey today we in basic I want to make this pretty thick honestly I felt like when I was done with the entire locals like I could have made this wing even thicker you can honestly go as thick and dramatic as you want with this wing because it's already such a fun bold look it will just add to it and grow up you're gonna do it do the damn thing right i have to of course obsessed over my wings to make sure they're even because I'm not being funny you guys it's not normal I'm such a perfectionist with my makeup if my wings aren't even I will literally wipe off my makeup and just leave the house with no makeup I rather have no makeup and uneven liner because i am that I'm a psychopath ok moving on I'm cutting my lashes with mascara to make sure that I don't have any of that eyeliner like stuck on it so that my natural lashes blow up my fake lashes really nicely and i'm going to be using the lower lashes and fluff and wispy these are probably the number one or two favorite dramatic lashes I think they're so gorgeous and now i'm going to move on to the face and I'm going to be priming it using my favorite primer right now which is the backlight priming filter it just gives such a gorgeous radiance to the skin if you're dry and you want radiance girl this primer is bomb and I'm going to grab my L'Oreal True Match Lumi cushion foundation and i'm going to take my foundation brush like I just take it and directly put it into the center of that cushion I don't press really hard because it can get full coverage really quickly i press like halfway down and i am using the morphe and 439 brush to blend this out this is my all-time favorite foundation brush a bar ever ever I've gone through a lot of obsession with a lot of foundation brushes and this is my absolute number one I feel like no matter what i try i always go back to this guy right here and then I'm going to pick up my favorite concealer ever and this is the Urban Decay Naked weightless concealer we put this on the entire under eye area and I know it looks like it's a lot but that's because it is i'm going to use a damp Beauty Blender though and using the damp Beauty Blender makes it so that even if you apply too much concealer it will pick up the excess and just make the under eyes look so natural which is why i have been die hard for a Beauty Blender for like the past two years now I'm going to grab the Anasazi a banana powder i'm going to set my under eye area i'm only using the banana powder today and I'm not mixing with anything else because i didn't want the under eye to be to highlighted I didn't want to be too shiny or to radiate I just wanted it to look really nice and soft with the rest of the skin and now using a fluffy brush I'm going to just apply a shear amount of powder no additional coverage just wanting to kind of slightly modify myself so I'm not super duper do we eat and then i'm going to go in with ardency Inn liner in the shade lilac oh these liners are my number one favorite liners in the game they're so creamy they stay so long my inner line and it kind of frustrating me because you can't really see the color popping on camera button person this color was gorgeous and I'm going to grab Mac deep damson this is a matte kind of wine purple shade and i'm going to take a definer brush any definer brush anything small precise will do we take it all the way from my lower lashes we're like my mint green liner ends i'm going to bring it into the inner corner and i'm going to stop it where my lashes stop growing if that makes sense and i'm going to pick up another morphy single eyeshadow this is in the shade magical magenta and i'm going to overlay it right on top of deep damn sinks I just felt like it was looking just a little too basic and typical under there and I wanted to really brighten it up and make it a little bit more fun because if we're gonna do it we're going to do it right like I want this look to stand out and be really colorful and different I'm going to pick up just a little bit more of that make a geek morocco and use it to blend out that lower lash line this will also help tie the entire look together to bring some of that warm orange on the lower lash as well now i'm going to go in with mac nylon my favorite brow highlight in our corner highlight of all time this has been a ride or die product of mine legit since what 2,000 oh my god 005 it's been a while I'm going to fill in my brows using the anastacio brow definer today is full of my favorites guys I just cause my favorite favorite product video because this is my favorite brow product ever like I don't think you understand everybody in my life has this definer now because I'm like wait a second you're still using the Browse i'll come on girl what are you living in a lot like this is the most amazing brow pencil of all time there's nothing like it i'm just ridiculously dedicated so let's just move past that we are going to be doing a little contouring and i'm going to be using a benefit hoola bronzer an oldie but a goodie I want to do an update a contour video soon because I just been using so many different brushes recently and we have been doing it I've been making it much more of an intense angle as far as from the top of the ear to the corner of the lips and then as always I am blending out the forehead area just around the hairline and making sure I don't get any product in the center of the forehead or center of the face because it will defeat the contouring purpose all right now mom's gonna bake do you see how much power I'm you think it looks like it's snowing in here do you see hope i'm using the RCM a no color powder to do a little bit of baking while i apply my blush and i'm using one of the new Becca blushes in the shade Tiger Lily they are very high pigmented they are very shimmery very frosty they're like similar to their highlight formula but for a blush so i use this coral shade to kind of tie the eyes and the cheeks together and then on top of it not necessary but I just felt like a little bit of pink - I picked up a little bit of mac kini pedal and i'm going to just put a little bit of that right over top so I feel like it was a little to call on my cheeks and I was like again not necessary I'm just extra and when you have a big makeup collection you want to use a lot you know what I'm saying so you can totally Capac blushes on do more than one but it is not necessary to all you guys going to go ahead and wipe away all that power that I put down there but then I was like wait a second I like the way this area looks i'm going to put just a little bit more and I'll dust it off in like a minute I'm going to grab some of the becca shimmering skin Perfector in the shade opal on a more feet 501 brush and I'm going to just highlight the tops of my cheekbones i still love opal so much it's like a cool tone highlight having a little bit of gray in it but it's just so beautiful it really stands out in a crowd I just love like the silver tones and I think it's really pretty I'm going to coat my lower lashes with some mascara I'm using the cabinet qua mascara i love this one it's my mom's favorite mascara and i've been using it a lot recently again and I i forgot how much i love it as well for lips i'm going to use color pop BFF lippie Stix it's like a really pretty orgy coralie kind of pale terracotta has a longer description of my life and then for gloss i'm going to go on with the Kylie cosmetics lip gloss in the shade so cute which is the Palace of all her shades I personally and not the biggest fan of these glasses I don't hate them but I'm not crazy about them you know you know I'm saying ok now i'm saying but I really like this with combination i think it looks super super pretty you know me I love a good nude and then just because I want to do a little something extra I'm going to take a little bit of brown shadow and just put it on my lower lip area just to give a natural contour to make my lips look a little bit fuller and powder and then use a little bit of clear brow gel so that these babies stay in place and that completes the look I hope you guys enjoyed thanks for watching love you see you soon hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial for you this actually feels more like a get ready video though because i am actually getting ready and I have to leave my house right now like I finished right on time so yeah I am sick i woke up this morning with eight terrible sore throat hurts so bad and probably go to the doctor because it's just not going i'm starting to think i'm getting a fever 2 which is just beyond typical because i am flying this week on i am going to New York City for a half business half vacation I will be there for four days i'm leaving on thursday return on monday so it's like of course I'm getting sick right now right so today is actually easter sunday so i am getting ready I'm leaving my house soon as i'm done with this to go spend the afternoon with my family for easter so yeah I hope you guys enjoy this makeup tutorial it's very spring appropriate very fresh I absolutely love this look I'm wearing it constantly constantly recently this is the same look that was wearing in my favorites video that i just did and so many of you were asking what I was wearing if I could do a tutorial so here it is I hope that you guys enjoy thanks so much for watching i love you guys and I'll see you soon bye hello my loves the first thing we're going to do today is prime our face i am using the Makeup Forever radiant primer I'm going to massage this on my face with clean hands you know the drill you know how to prime your skin moving on i'm going to use the smashbox primer water only because i was so dry from being sick but two primers not necessary let's get real I'm going to also go in with the cabin a quan liquid highlighter I talked about this in my most recent favorites video this highlighter is my favorite going to massage that all over my bare skin just to give a really beautiful radiant glow as the base then i'm going to go in with your new dare foundation and I'm going to be applying that with what do you know the Sigma f80 kabuki brush as always i'm currently using the shade 030 in this foundation and actually is a pinch too light for me but that's okay i'm going to go with bronzer and i'm going to warm up the skin and add some color I would prefer my foundation to be a little bit too light over too dark any day of the week now I'm going to be applying my under eye concealer and i'm using the Urban Decay Naked weightless full-coverage concealer I think I just nailed it i'm going to apply a little bit of on the under eye area and then also on the lid as well and I'm going to blend all that out with a damp Beauty Blender a tiny bit of this product goes a very long way so as you see i do not have to over use it and this is my favorite way to prime my eyes is to just use concealer and then go over top of it with a powder so i am using the anastacio banana powder to set this entire area that's my favorite way to Prime and i am using the morphe m510 brush for this i really like it because it's kind of tapered and precise and i really like it for that area now i'm going to go in with the Chanel cream bronzer I should have done this before i set my under eye area i never recommend using any creams after powders but I wasn't feeling well so I wasn't really with it that day so I forgot but if you're doing this on your own do the cream first and then set the under eye area so i am using the Sigma f80 to which is an angled kabuki brush to apply this all over the cheekbones the forehead the temples the chin I'm just kind of bronzing not contouring now i'm going in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow and i'm using a sigma e40 brush to blend this back and forth and windshield wiper motions in my crease like i said before peach smoothie is my absolute favorite number one eye shadow of all time I basically can't do any makeup look without it it's just perfect for a nice transition shade now i'm grabbing makeup geek cupcake on that exact same brush I'm going to dust this right i mean that color back and forth and windshield wiper motions from inner corner to outer corner and then i will blend it upward as that product kind of disappears from my brush i will start going up like you see right now just to make sure that everything is blended together and we have no harsh lines now i'm going to go in with makeup geek latte this is kind of a reddish medium brown color and using a more precise brush this is the e25 from sigma i'm going to put that lower in my crease area so as you can see i am no longer kind of blending upward like I do with the other colors I'm kind of blending onward onto the eyelid if that makes sense as you can see right here then I'll go back with the sigma e40 and blend everything out once again with absolutely no additional product on that brush now i'm taking make a get chickity this is an oldie but a goodie has been one of my favorites forever it was just a touch of that i'm going to put it in that upper crease as well a lot of people are fearful of this color because it's orange and it can look crazy but if you use just a touch of it adds such a beautiful glow now i'm going in with makeup geek foiled eyeshadow and this is in the spotlight this is one of my absolute favorite shadows ever it is so beautiful it is such a gorge is beaming highlight shade for the lid i am using a mac 242 brush which is just a flat shader brush to apply that all over the lid you can use your finger for this product that works really well what's great about these is you get no fallout which is like my favorite part so once i put that generously all over the lid i will go back with the Sigma e25 and just kind of go over the edges that way there's not a distinct harsh line to where the shadow starts then i'm going to fill in my eyebrows i'm using anastacio browse in the shade nope i'm going to skip through this really quickly though because it's not so fun to watch in my opinion now i'm going in with mac and bark I love embark this is one of my colors that I just have to have from Mac it is a go-to color for me it's a super dark rich kind of purply brown and using an e 15 from sigma i'm going to just press that really tightly on my lower lashline not too generously because i don't want to be too dark and smoky then taking any pencil brush and a little bit of that same latte color that I used on my upper lid i'm going to just blend that out making the goofiest face of all time I'm going to go in with mango tango this is another shade from makeup geek such a pretty kind of orangie pink I love this color and I'm just gonna put a little dab of it on that lower lash line as well just to give some more dimension now i'm going in with a creamy ivory eyeliner and I'm going to line my waterline to really open up my eyes and make them look very fresh and springy i will list the one that I use in the description bar down below now i'm applying mascara so I am prepping my eyes for lashes we're going to be going on with my absolute favorite which are whisper sweet nothings by the lore lashes I love these because they look beautiful with or without eyeliner they're not too over the top of my face into dramatic but yet they're still super girly and they make a statement now i'm going to go in with makeup geek blush man it's a makeup geek day I'm going to be mixing a rendezvous and spellbound to make a really kind of purply pastel pinky cheek i have been loving loving this color of cheek recently for spring it's just so girly and dainty and super feminine now i'm going to be doing something that is so unnecessary and i'm going to be using it to separate highlighters these are both by becca and we are going in with opal and moonstone and i'm mixing those together just because i own them both and they are absolutely gorgeous when combined so i am using PM 501 brush to place this all over the tops of my cheekbones I keep the bow a dot on my chin and i'm also going to use the shades to highlight the brow bone as well i am again using the mac 242 brush to highlight the brow now i'm going to go and of course with mascara this is Mack nigga blacklash this is my favorite lower lash mascara I know it seems high maintenance to have a favorite lower lash mascara but I do now i'm going to go in with colour-pop lippie sick in the shade a westie a beautiful baby pink I'm going to top that off with a nars gloss in the shade glow pink which is coming very soon and their spring collection so that is a wrap on this fresh spring and makeup look I hope you guys enjoy thanks so much for watching as always I love you and I'll see you soon bye guys today I'm going to be getting a jump start on spring trend tutorials I don't know how many cents the way that just came out but anyways I am very eager for the spring trends to be amongst us and so leading fashion week I thought this was like the perfect opportunity to go ahead and start spraying friends i live in florida so I really feel like it's spring for those of you who are braving heat horrific storms and all the snow and ice up north I feel you I was once there with you I'm sorry seriously think so bad so here i am bringing you a little bit of sunshine i have been wearing this I look for nine years of my life which is a pretty big deal to continuously where the same island for nine years and still like it and still not get sick of it not to mention i have done this look on tons of my clients in the past and it really does look good on all skin tones and even if you are very fair a lot of people who are super fair Bernie's II feel like they can't wear copper you totally can and especially those with blue and green eyes is going to make your eyes so bright and there's a brown eyes and it's going to really bring out the honey in your eyes so it's beautiful on everybody i hope you guys enjoy this spring a huge trend is copper eyes oranges yellows coppers warm ground which I love because you usually think of autumn and fall for that type of trying but this year's spring you guys know that is like literally right up my alley I am so super excited so I thought I'll go ahead and shows with you it's a very fresh based super easy not even wearing eyeliner today which is crazy for me right so i hope you guys enjoyed this video i hope that you do it yourself a call if you do don't forget to tag me in any pictures and as always all the information every single detail every single question everything product that he mentioned in this video is going to be in the description bar below so many guys so much else sees it but we are going to start off today with the skin so first I'm going to do is primarily using do our globe maximizer like boosting primer and we are going to press this into the skin it will make such a difference if you press your primer into your skin as opposed to just rubbing it across your pores then we are going to go in with NARS sheer glow foundation and marc jacobs mixing these two together just gives me a really nice natural luminous finish I just that's just me I like mixing my foundations and i am using a sigma a brush to apply the foundation as always and then I'm going to go in with tarte amazonian clay concealer which I don't think I've ever even use on camera before but I actually would like to finish of this and i'm using it just too lightly highlight some areas of my phases where needed so around the lips Cupid's bow chin nostrils where you just get more morally red and as you can see this is not a very intense highlight it's nice and mild which I really like for a look like this since we really do want the skin to look nice and fresh and youthful but we don't want it to be like BAM highlighter or BAM contour your face so a little trick is just using your concealer for the face and I do prefer this concealer on the face as opposed to under the eyes I find that increases a little bit so under the eye i am going to use mac pro longwear concealer this one isn't she NW 20 which is a pinky beige undertone and as you can see it looks like i'm putting a lot on but i am actually blending it out and my finger will pick up a lot of the excess and then this is the f-86 brush by Sigma and the reason i love this brush so much is because it picks up so much excess concealer so you really don't get that buildup of chunky concealer that crease is underneath your eye i just love this brush because of that i'm also sweeping across my eyelid to prime for my eye shadow then I'm going to go in with my Bobby Brown Foundation stick to contour i will put my contouring video down below that's all about cream highlighter so you can see exactly what i'm doing and how I'm doing it but I am just using an angled brush again by Sigma absolutely love this brush for contouring as you can see it just blends out so naturally so beautifully I do pick up the product on the brush first as opposed to drawing on my face where the contour can be a little too strong and intense this will make it look much more buff out and natural just like you've been kissed by the Sun then i'm going to go in with Smashbox suntan matte bronzer with the NARS eat a brush and just hit that on that high point of my cheekbone and just dust it out I'm not going to really take this or drag all around the face just to bring more depth to certain areas and then using a Marc Jacobs foundation brush don't ask i'm obsessed with it i don't know why i bought it and now i'm just i'm in love this brush for buffing up my bronzer then i am using the brow bar to go this is by lightning lightning I have fallen in love with this product recently so i'm just going to use the lighter shade to fill in the inner part of my brow and the darker brown to fill in the outer part i am using anastacio brush I'm not sure which one it is but i will list it down below and then using the anastacio contour kit i am going to go in with this banana color right there in the center and mix it with mac emphasized as always and then just lightly dust that around the eye area i am using a sigma tapered highlighting brush to do so and as you can see i am just padding padding padding you don't want to go too generous with this highlight because again you don't want the skin to be really intense today you want to keep it nice not natural not au is not the word because this definitely isn't natural but you understand we don't want anything to be too intense and in your face so make sure using a light hand with all the products that you are applying so just using these highlighting powders just set everything that I've done then i'm going to go in with amber lights and copper ring both by math cosmetics these are the two shadows that i have been wearing for nine years of my life mixing them together is just absolutely beautiful so I am using a sigma e25 brush just about this all over my lid which is just a white goat hair blending black brush and this is the only brush that you will need for this look on the top of the eyelid and because these shadows are so creamy and smooth you don't even need another brush or another color to buff it out where typically in your transition shade and this look this is all you need with putting no additional products on that brush just buff upward and it will just naturally blend itself out just make sure you continuously go and windshield wiper motions then with any pencil brush this is an old-school pencil brush i just use it all the time is like my tried-and-true die don't even remember what brand is from it might be sedona lace just put that on earth your eyes from inner to outer corner buffing it back and forth again make sure you get even amount of product of the gold and the copper if anything like to pick up a little bit additional gold then with no additional products and a blending brush I just go back and forth just to buff that out even more and give a really blown out feel then i'm using Giorgio Armani is to kill mascara which oh my gosh I'm falling in love with this is a sample size and I do not want to spend that kind of money on mascara i'm pretty sure i'm going to have to then i'm using Mac spring machine blush which is absolutely gorgeous it's the perfect peach with a little bit of pink and i'm going to dust that on the apples of my cheeks working backward blending it into that bronzer toward the temple area making big buffing circular motions to again adds that sunkissed glow look then I go in with the same brush that I used to highlight and I just kind of go over that blush area and that's what gives you the really blown out airbrush look on the cheeks then i'm using the Bekaa highlighter in the shade opal which I am falling in love with this is such a great dupe for mac whisper of guilt which is only comes out like once a year in a collection and everybody loves it and it's such a beautiful highlighter but this one is so close in comparison I absolutely love it so using a sigma taper how to brush again I'm going to touch on the high points of my base moving on and I'm just going to cut my bottom lashes and any mascara you want just to finish off that I look now it is totally optional but i'm just going to pop on a pair of false lashes with look like this false lashes can be really really pretty and you don't need any eyeliner as long as you get close enough to your lash line these are escudo lashes I'm not sure which style i will list that in the description bar with a link to it and then using the Maybelline gel liner this is totally optional i just wanted to show you an easy tip just to push it up on that top waterline this will make your lashes look thicker fuller and blend your natural ones with your fake ones it's also a great tip just to make your lashes look fuller you know if you're not wearing falsies then using the Tarte Amazonian butter lipstick and golden pink I'm going to also mix that with the YSL rouge alup number 15 using patting motions to get my favorite lip color for spring absolutely love then setting everything with Urban Decay eyeshadow makeup setting spray i'm going to take a shower in it just as everything is set and then you're all done so i hope you enjoy this fresh-faced spring tutorial and love you guys and I'll see you soon hey guys so today I'm going to be doing it really easy everyday fresh face makeup look this is truly an everyday makeup look this is as little as it gets for me if I am NOT doing this and I'm not doing anything i typically only wear make up about three or four days a week me sometimes like one or two days a week but three to four days a week and this is a look I wear one like I have to get up early and i'm going to be running errands all day long I don't want to be looking like a caveman but at the same time I want to give a little something so this is like my happy medium where I'm not all dolled up and glamorous oh yeah i'm not looking like I dead so this is super easy basic gonna work for everybody of course i have a couple versions of like my everyday makeup look this is the most easy basic shortest one that I have you have an upgraded version of this that's a few more additional products a little bit more glamorous I of course will be happy to do that for you if you want to see that look as well but I thought we would start with the basics so i hope you enjoyed this makeup tutorial and i will see you guys soon good morning everybody well hello honey boo go nice to see you shirtless ok moving on the first thing we're going to do is put on our foundation I'm using bucks and show some skin weightless foundation i'm going to be using my very own brush line today making your tips I'm going to just warm this up and emulsified on the tips of my fingers make sure your hands are freshly clean and then i'm going to just rub this on my face I know you're probably thinking oh what the hell just froze over where is your Sigma f80 but when you're in a rush and if your brushes are dirty mhm my situation sometimes you just gotta use your fingertips God made him for a reason so make sure you Bluff in the foundation it's not gonna look as pretty as a brush but hey we can manage that i'm using maybelline fit me concealer this is a drugstore concealer obviously since its by Maybelline it is a nice sheer concealer but you can get a medium coverage out of it because it is buildable using my middle finger i'm going to just blend this in and then i'm also going to make sure that I get it on my eyelid I always always do this because you have a lot of veins in your eyelid and if you're tired you're definitely get redness there and it's gonna show all your dirty secrets so cover up your eyelid area it will smooth everything out make you look a lot more fresh I tap this nav as always I take it back towards my temple make sure when you're finishing off you go in an inward motion from outer corner in your corner it will help prevent creasing then using bare minerals well rested powder this powder is formulated to make you look well-rested has a brightening effect in it but it is not a highlighter so don't get it confused this is just going to set your concealer and give a nice well rested effect it's really nice for everyday look because it looks nice and natural and there's no shimmer or highlight happening it whatsoever I always set my eye area just so that that doesn't move around whatsoever now i'm going to go in with benefit give me brow gimme brow sorry give me about the tiniest little itty-bitty brush of life I'm gonna go in and just brush through my natural brow hair I love gimme brow because it has fibers and it adheres to your natural brow hair so not only do they still and it makes it look fuller instantly it is such a genius product and because the brush is so tiny it grabs on to every single little baby hair it is so so fast so double grass and i'm going to go in with makeup geek creme brulee eyeshadow you can use any eyeshadow you want or bronzer whatever you prefer this is just my go-to eyeshadow that looks nice my skin tone and I can just put it in my crease any day of the week and I'm never going to be disappointed by it we all have those go to colors and this one is mine so using an e 40 brush by Sigma this is definitely my go-to i brush when it comes to blending and buffing things out so i'm just going from inner corner to outer corner and it's just going to contour our eyes so we don't look like we're sleeping I'm going to curl my lashes any lash curler will be just fine as long as you like it and I get a couple of pulses squeeze squeeze squeeze and I'm good to go i'm gonna go in with l'oreal voluminous original mascara in the shade black and make sure that when you're applying your mascara you really wiggle especially at the root of your lashes it's a little trick that we all use just like you tease your hair for fullness you want to tease your lashes for fullness as well so really go back and forth and wiggle at the root of those lashes and then drag it down straight work if that makes sense then we're going to go in with mac care blend pressed powder in the shade dark this is my go-to bronzing powder right now and i'm using a big fat fluffy brush and I'm going to just bronze in the outer portion of my cheeks as you can see i shake off a lot of the excess this will help / bronzing any streaking or muddiness that could happen on the face so I'm just going to bring the cheek area and then around the forehead just to even it out don't neglect your forehead when bronzing because it can look a little weird I'm going with matt spring sheet i always choose a blush it has a really nice shimmer in it because on days like today I'm not going to be doing the whole highlighting and contouring so using a brush like this already has some shimmer in it will help to highlight and a more subtle way and not just like BAM streaks of highlight on the cheeks then i go over with that well rested again whatever is left on that brush and this is just a trick to buff things out so you don't have any harshness and it looks airbrushed on the cheeks now we're going to go in with mac sure we're going to just dad this underneath that brow this is my favorite most universal beautiful highlight shade I've loved it for years and i truly pretty much use it on everyone and going to dab and inner corner as well putting a light shimmer in the inner corner and brow will really help in making you look more awake for someone who's more mature i highly recommend mylar my mac cosmetics it doesn't have as much shimmer but it's beautiful I'm going to go in with stigma lip gloss in the shade tent this is my favorite lip gloss right now for days like today because it's pretty much the exact same color of my lips but just nice and glossy it's got that perfect little rose effect to it going to put that on and then we are all done can we get any easier I think not I love you guys thank you for watching and I'll see you soon hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a prom makeup tutorial this

is back in stock and will be available until wednesday April thirtieth which is one week from today unless it sells out beforehand I will list all of the direct links along with the discount code for you guys in my description bar below this video if any of you are interested ok let's get into the tutorial first thing I'm going to do as always is prime my eyes I'm using mac pro longwear concealer in the shade and w 20 this is a little bit lighter than my natural skin tone which will really help to get a nice blank highlighted canvas as the background and make your shadow show up a little bit more intensely not to mention such a smooth surface to blend and work with your shadows on then going in with good old scotch tape we're going to take off a piece and put on the back of our hand just to get off that intense stickiness so it doesn't pull out your eye area now we're going to match up kind of winged eyeliner from the angle of your ID going toward the tail of your brow I did the same method in my smoky Cateye tutorial and it works like a charm then going with makeup geek peach smoothie and creme brulee we are going to take an e-40 brush and just dust this in our crease we're going to start in the outer corner because we prefer to have the darkest color in the outer corner and wherever you first lay your brush on the skin is where you're going to have the most pigments but we are going to blend this all the way into the inner corner and add that pigment is leaving the brush start going upward and that will help blend it out then going in with makeup geek trap we are going to take this color which is a mid-tone brown it's not as warm as the others which really helps give more dimension to the look and we are using a sigma e25 starting again and that outer crease you can go right over that tape which is what makes this look so easy just that tape makes it impossible to be too messy so just go right on that tape blind to all the way from inner and outer corner and make sure you blend it out with a clean brush another shadow by makeup geek is cocoa bear we're going to take this on the same a 25 x sigma and put this predominantly in that outer corner I know this seems like a lot of shadows but that's because it's a lot of shadows and this is going to give you the best result then going in with make a beak corrupt any black shadow will do make it because the blood shadow I've ever personally worked with before and this is a makeup geek brush I don't know the name or number of it i will sit down below in my description bar of course which is going right over top of that tape we're going to blend it in work the great thing about this is you do not have to worry about blending two perfectly because the next step will really take care of that for us so just go over with any brush you can have a little cocoa bear left on it or can be blank whatever and I just go over that black area just so that you don't have any harsh lines right in there but don't worry about blending it on your lid we're going with Too Faced shadow insurance glitter glue huh one of the best products in the world when working with intense pigments or glitters at all we're going to put this all over the lid as you can see i use my finger then we're going to go in with makeup geek it's making me kind of gay people utopia this is such an amazing pigment but listen to me when I say use a glitter glue if you don't use a glitter glue it can be a hot mess packing this all over our lid we are using a mac 242 brush because when i find working with messy intense pigments like this you're going to have the best outcome when you use the thinnest brush possible that brush is gonna take too much of it and slaughter on your face so thin brush like this we'll pack it on as you can see I'm patting i am not sweeping so you want to pat pat pat pat pat this and you want to blend and sweep your brushes when you're blending your other shadows but with this pigment just strictly Pat we did the eyes first because otherwise this will be all over our foundation so just peeling off that tape you can see shows am baby you have got an intense cat eye when you first pull it off it always looks kind of weird like okay that's a really really harsh line but you will see how we are going to blend that out you can see up close it's intense you could just pop on a pair of false lashes like this and you'll be good to go just mascara your natural lashes and you can see super pretty i'm going to show you how to do eyeliner if you're interested because it is so easy so you're going to follow that natural line at the scotch tape made taking any black liner i am using Maybelline blackest black and i'm just going to follow that exact edge and then just sculpt out my eyeliner as always whenever you are doing eyeliner over any sort of glitter sparkle chunky pigment anything along that line just be patient you're gonna have to go over a few times back and forth to make sure that it is black if you're a perfectionist like me you have to go over a lot of times because i hate glitter being on my black liner and then we're going to pop on a pair of false lashes by the Brandis quito i am not positive of the name of these so i will sit in my description bar right below this video they are very dramatic and very prominent proprietary when I got them in the mail I looked at them and I was it from oh sorry how to bust out and dance for two seconds moving on make up for ever micro perfecting primer is where i'm going to be using it's important to Prime and times where you really want to make up to last last last in this primer i do see a difference i really been enjoying it so make sure you press it into the skin has a nice yellow tent in a few different colors depending what you need now i'm going in with NARS sheer glow foundation I'm using the shade punjab and using an f-86 up kabuki brush one of these days I'm going to switch it up on you guys use a different foundation brush and you're going to be like hell froze over what's happening for right now I'm going to be using the f80 as always impressing into the skin i always start in a pressing motion and whatever is left over you can kind of move around in a sweeping motion but pressing into the skin will help it lasts the longest make sure you blend it down the jawline so you have a line of demarcation then i'm going to fill in my brows I'll put my brow video down below in the description bar i usually put all my basic videos down there in case you're curious i'm using the Anasazi or browse in the shade soft brown and then caramel for the tail so by being we're going to finish that do you whatever you want to do with your brows have fun then we're going to go in with the same concealer that we put on our eyes in the beginning mac pro longwear and w20 as you can see it's lighter than the rest of my foundation which we are going for because i want that highlighted look I'm blending it out with the sigma f 86 brush which is my holy grail foundation I'm sorry concealer brush I absolutely love this brush evening out our highlight under our eyes we are going to highlight other areas of our face using the Mac prep and prime highlighter and shade light boost which is the green yellow shade there is also one that is a pinky shade and a peach i'm going to just put this around the mouth area and then in between the eyebrows this will help so that you don't have that stark white under eye area and the rest of your face just looks kind of strange you want to balance it all out by doing this it's very quick and very easy i know it looks intense promise you then i'm going to go ahead and set that under eye concealer using macpro highlighting powder in the shape emphasize this is a stark white powder so make sure that you are not going overboard with it just a light tapping is all you need again I tap this and press this into the skin other than a sweeping motion it will help to truly absorb that powder and not crease throughout the day as opposed to when you just sweep it across the face sometimes it can settle into the fine lines even more then we're gonna go on with Smashbox suntan matte bronzer and we're going to contour using our nars eat a brush i highly recommend contouring on prom as opposed to bronzing because this will definitely show up and pictures it'll make you look nice and mature and really give you that Kim K look that everyone is going for I of course will put my contour video down below I am sculpting out my cheekbones and around the temples of my forehead and you can touch a little bit on the jaw line and blend it all out then going in with mac shroom we are going to put this right underneath our eyebrows on that brow bone and a little tip if you have issues blending your eyeshadow up on top by the brows just kind of bring this brush down and blend it into that shadow that you already have on the eye area and it will help bring it all together and we're going to put a dabble of cocoa bear which was that warm brown and our outer corner on the lower lash then going in with whatever you want creme brulee frappe anything you have just take any pencil brush and just blend back and forth back and forth this is really going to open up your eyes so i recommend you really blend don't be scared blend back and forth and really buff out this under eye area and make them look much bigger especially and photos then i'm going to use makeup geek I don't know the name of this liner for the first time in my life I'm at a loss for words I cannot remember the name of the signer it's a black gel liner i listed down below I love this for the water line because it does not move and it does not burn and those are the only two things i'm asking for life when it comes to liners then I'm going to go in with back a wild honey blush saddest day ever i'm going to just blend this all of the cheek area this is a bronzy color with a little bit of terracotta in it's so gorgeous it doesn't have a super shimmer which I don't want a really intense shimmer I want my keeps to be a little bit more mad and then we're going to go in with a highlight this is opal by becca one of my all-time favorite highlights ever in a sigma taper highlighting brush just to highlight those cheekbones this again will look absolutely beautiful and pictures you wont be over shimmery over Dewey it will be the perfect amount and photos just a little top of it on the chin Cupid's bow and nose and you're done i'm going to remove the foundation i have going on my lips and you can see how naturally pigmented my lips are it's a little intense and it's difficult for me to get new lips because of how pigmented my naturally are so we're going to go in with mac creme brulee this is a cream machine i believe so it's nice and creamy and on the sheer side and i'm going to top it off with color your smile lighted lip gloss in the shade nude if you guys have not heard of these glasses yet you need to jump on the bandwagon they're amazing and they have a mirror on the side of the lip gloss tube and they light up so you can do your lip gloss in the dark in public it is definitely a prom and all night out essential I love mine then i'm going to set the masterpiece with Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray and take a quick bath in this and we are all done i love you guys so much thank you for watching happy prom and i'll see you soon hey guys today I'm going to be doing my first holiday look I am super excited to finally be doing this oh my gosh so the story behind this yes there's a story as always so I uploaded my blog - it's a couple of days ago and if you guys watch that you can see that i have my friends in town and I like a little vacation and I got sick to top it off and it's like we're not running Cygnus but anyways because of that I haven't got around to doing quality looks and I have all these ideas and everything is so last night I was setting up my lights and everything to film this morning and I wanted to do something like really crazy colorful and glittery and the holidays and then I was like you know what yes those things might be fun but we're already in the middle of the month and I thought I want to do something it's more neutral and wearable for you guys that are actually watching this video because even though it can be fun to watch something like glittering over the top but like why i like you know like not actually useful for the average woman and we're already in mid-december so it's like I figured let's just do something that like you guys can actually take tips from you guys can actually use for yourself at home you're saying so I i love this look it's like a very soft cut crease we have some glitter in there but it's not too much not overboard I just think that this is very subtle but at the same time screams the holidays you compare this I with any lip color that you want right now i'm wearing occ lip tar in the shade harlot Marlo harlot is what i am wearing so yeah oh yeah and he's ready to thank you so much for watching i love you guys so much i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and i'll see you soon but so I'm going to be starting off priming my eyes because we are going to start with our eyes today since we are using glitter I don't start my foundation because the glitter can fall down and kind of ruin the foundation so study with eyes i'm going in with mac kid eyeshadow this is a great transition color if you're familiar with soft brown it's kind of similar just a little bit cooler and lighter in tone which i absolutely love so using an e 40 brush from sigma i'm going to concentrate this on the upper crease of my eye I'm trying to kind of avoid the lid just because we we're going to do a soft cut crease today now i'm going in with a morphy eyeshadow and this is number 62 this is a little bit darker than kid and it's very neutral in tone so it's not going to be too warm or too cool using a sigma e25 i'm going to just put that again in that upper crease area kind of trying to avoid the lid once we have that on i'm going to go in with another morphy shadow and this is number 15 which is much warmer in tone i'm going to take a makeup geek blending brush you can go in the same be 25 this was just laying there so I just used it for you no no really different reason but i'm going to again to the exact same thing with this and I'm going to just start buffing everything upward again just avoiding that lid board the fact that we are doing a soft cut crease then I go in with an e 40 from sigma always this is like the magic wand in my collection just to buff everything out and make sure that we have no harsh lines and then i'm going to go in with mac shroom this is very loved in my house as you can see i go through probably i would say one of these a year because I just absolutely love it it's gorgeous all over the lid it's gorgeous as a brow bone highlight as a chick highlight it works pretty much on all skin tones it's just a great color so using a 242 brush from Mac I'm going to just press this all over the lid and going to help it to carve helped carve out of that lid area even more so we have more of a defined cut crease as you can see i will push that up on the entire lid up into that crease area to kind of erase some of the brown fell down on our lid this will just help define it just a little bit more and then as always I will go back with a blending brush and just ever so slightly make sure that we have no harsh lines because even though i'm doing a slight cut crease I still don't want to be too harsh so now taking a makeup geek pencil brush and makeup geek corrupt eyeshadow which is a very black intense shadow i'm going to just ever so slightly press the shadow on my upper lash line only on the outer corner of my eye this will give kind of like a romantic soft smokey effect but I love doing this only on the outer corner and leaving the inner corner blank because I just think that it really gives you like that cat eye and it's just very romantic as opposed to lining everything which can be a little bit more dramatic and a little bit more harsh Plus this brush makes this step just like foolproof anyone can do it I'm going to go with a pencil brush and literally just above it back and forth with really no rhyme or reason just so that it's not harsh whatsoever because i do not want it to be too black or too intense at all i want to be nice and soft and subtle so now for the fun part i'm going to be going in with mac cosmetics loose glitter and this is in the shade reflects pearl this is a mac pro item mine is from an old wonder woman collection but you can still get it online on just the regular mac cosmetics website to add here that to the eyes i am using two faced shadow insurance and glitter glue I put it in the back of my hand and then I kind of pick it up with a 242 brush anything that's flat and I press that glitter all over the lid and then I immediately put my brush in the glitter and I start dabbing if you do this your glitter will not move it will not fall on your face it will not crease this glitter glue is everything there are many different brands that have glitter glue but i just love this one it's like my tried-and-true it literally is like super glue for glitter i absolutely love it i've never had an issue with it so i put it all over my lid and then immediately within 10 seconds I pack on that glitter well it's still tacky now i'm going to go in with flutter lashes in the style Kim oh my gosh i love these lashes they are so fun they're like have these lashes so they're not going to go on your entire lash line they're only gonna go on the outer corner but they are so cool I was not expecting to love them as much as I do but look at how awesome that is like it's just a little extra something so i didn't want to go overboard the lashes because i wanted the inner corner to be nice and subtle and kind of blank and I wanted the outer corner to have more like a romantic kind of flirty vibe so I love these lashes for that purpose I'm going to be priming my face and I'm using our glass of ale and I'm gonna rub that all over and then i'm going to go in with the what do you know the same foundation is always giorgio armani luminous silk i'm using shade 6.5 and no it does not match my face whatsoever but it does match my neck and that is what we want to color match it with I need to get my selfless tanner on though because this is not a good look for me so yeah I need to remind me to do that later thank you moving on i'm going to go ahead and conceal my under eye area i'm using mac pro longwear concealer which is try to intrude absolute favorite concealer ever ever ever ever for the under eye area I'm mixing shades nw20 and NW 25 just to get my perfect color i really wish that they would make like an NW 22.5 because hello I need up in here using a damp Beauty Blender I'm going to blend that concealer out towards the temple is just to kind of give a slight sculpted lifted look to the face i'm going to set my under eye concealer as always i'm using anastacio banana powder from her contour kit I also mix it with mac pro emphasize shaping powder i am using a tapered highlighting brush from sigma which is ideal for the under eye area and i'm going to use a mineralized skin finish from mac and shade medium plus and i'm just going to put powder on my nose because i don't like a shiny nose I'm totally out of focus here for my brows so i'm going to move right past that because i just did a video and i will link it down below so after my brows I am highlighting my brow bone using the same car that we use on the lid which is shroom by Mac then to finish off the eye area I'm going to take the same black shadow from makeup geek and i'm going to just put that only on the outer corner of my lower lash line and then buff it out with a pencil brush as you can see it took 2 seconds I don't really want it to be perfect on there i want to be a little messy just to kind of give that soft romantic feel and on the inner corner i'm going to highlight as well using any highlight that you want i think im using shroom here i might be using crystal avalanche because they're right next to each other my palate but whatever you want i'm putting a quick coat of mascara on my lower lashes i'm using a rimmel lash accelerator from the drugstore so that is our completed I look and now to finish this off we will move to the face i'm going to use a mac studio careful and pressed powder in the shade dark which is technically a face powder but like I've said many times before i love using face powders for sculpting the face because i think that they usually are the softest ones and most blendable since they are designed to be a full coverage foundation I typically like those the best for contour e so using a makeup geek blush brush I believe this is I'm going to just put this on the temples in a contour a little bit we're going to go in with a more fee and b5 and just buff all this out so that it looks more like bronze and not like LA in your face contour I'm going to go in with becca flower child I wanted some pinky cheeks and i am going to be using the morphe what is this this is the more feet mm no g8 the morphe GA as my blush brush i absolutely love this brush for blush it's like my favorite right now for highlight i'm going to go in with artists couture this is the diamond glow powder and i am going to be mixing the shade conceded and yeah as I give myself seriously want to say that I'm going to be mixing those two colors and highlighting my cheekbones I'm gonna be honest this looks way better in person the camera is picking it up very chunky which I am NOT happy about but in person these really are very beautiful to complete this look you can pair any lip color you want but i did choose to use occ lip tar in the shade harlot and i will put the lip liner that imac shit with in the description box down below so that completes this tutorial i hope you guys enjoy i love you so much happy holidays and i'll see you soon bye guys hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial and honestly I have no idea what i'm calling this yet I am so scatterbrained right now I just literally grab some eyeshadow sat down and just fill this as i was coming up with it in the mirror so typically i am much more thought-out and put together before I fill my tutorial for you but this was just like I was inspired to do this because twice yesterday i saw in a magazine article and on the TV show how orange eyeshadow is so I'm trying for summer but so many people are intimidated by the color and don't know how to wear it so I was like I got it because if you watch my channel and if you are new to my channel the first thing you should know about me is I am orange obsessed anything warm brown orange corals gold yellows I just I love itself about that I would do a tutorial for you guys showing you how all of you can get an orange eyeshadow look that is not overwhelming not gonna be scary and it's going to come with all I shades this look is really going to make light eyes such as mine blue green hazel eyes really bright and really stand out there very complimentary sorry I'm like talking so much with my hands way too enthused about this situation my personal favorite eye color for this look though is brown eyes anytime that I use the shadows on a brown eyed girl oh so beautiful it will just make the honey stand out in your brown eyes and just really shine through so this really will look good on all I colors and as you'll see the tutorial it is so easy to achieve so I'm going to stop rambling and one of you guys enjoy this video sorry for being a little over the place in a little wacky Jackie is always i love you guys so much thanks for watching and I'll see you later hey guys so the first thing I'm going to be doing today is applying lip balm i am using the sugar lip treatment it's always a good idea to moisturize your lips before you apply your makeup so they don't get dried out then i'm using an oldie but a goodie L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation I'm using my Sigma f80 flat top kabuki brush to press this into my skin this foundation is ideal for somebody who is dry to normal and skin type because it has such a beautiful dewy luminosity to it it does not have any glitter or any shimmer or Sparkle and it just gives a really dewy fresh face glow I absolutely love it it is from the drugstore but feels much more like a high-end luxurious foundation it is beautiful on the skin then we're going to go in with mac pro longwear concealer and i'm going to tap this starting an inner corner of my eye lightly dragging it down make sure you're very careful towards the temple and then going in with sigma f 86 this is not technically a concealer brush but i use it as a concealer brush because since it has the synthetic fibers it really soaks up the excess concealer so if you're somebody who can accidentally be too heavy-handed on your concealer application this will really soak up the excess product so that you won't have creasing or cake under eye area then we are going to go in with mac pro soft focus which is the yellow shade and emphasize which is the white one and we're going to mix them together and just tap this underneath the eye area to set that concealer using a sigma tapered highlighter brush I use this brush for many different things and this is one of them i am currently out of my anastacio banana color powder so i am using the soft focus one instead which is absolutely ideal for anybody who is a little bit darker and skin tone of the meat but I'm making it work then I'm going to fill in my brows just like normal and i'm using anastacio browse now i am using oh yeah look at the difference in those brows baby i am using a different shade accidentally like i told you i'm a little over the place today accidentally using the wrong shade to fill in my brows so because of that they come out looking a little ashy today but we can see past that and just move right along and filling them in like normal though no intense like shaping or anything just a typical brow Phil situation then we're gonna move on to eye shadow i'm using makeup geek peach smoothie and a sigma e40 fluffy brush and I'm going to dust this from inner corner to outer corner as you can see i am a lightly building it up but I'm starting off with just a tiny amount of eyeshadow and just making it more intense as we go it is so important to start off with a light color like this higher up and the crease this will really make it so that your blending just comes out perfectly start with a light color first then move downward and darker shapes going on with makeup geek chickity and an e 35 brush any 35 brush is a more tapered brush it has less hairs and it is longer so it's going to blend a little bit more precisely and get deeply in that crease so I'm going all the way from inner corner to outer corner back and forth and windshield wiper motions them back with the e-40 to buff it out you can use more peach smoothie if you want you don't have to just make sure you blend blend blend and windshield wiper motions this is a part of the tutorial where accidentally didn't record the majority of applying eyeshadow so i'm going to explain to you exactly what i do i am using makeup geek glamorous eyeshadow as you can see right here in this clip it is a beautiful bronzy gold shade it is more of a rose gold with some copper tones in it is absolutely gorgeous we're putting that all over the lid from inner corner to outer corner then we're going to take makeup geek gold digger eyeshadow we're going to put that on top of the shade glamorous and the ball of our eyes so right in the center of that lid we're going to put gold digger or top just to get a pop so now you have that bronzy copper and gold going on on that lid then we're gonna mix tickety and cocoa bear and rub that all over the lower lash line and then last but not least we're going to highlight the inner corner and the brow with becca opal highlighter such an amazing highlighter look at that thing it's beaming it's amazing and then we are going to get back to reality okay we are now applying the lower lashes and whisper sweet nothings these are like my top three favorite lashes of life I just absolutely love them and i am using a different glue than normal this is a house of lashes I ran out of my duo glue this month and so i have been using this for a few weeks and so far i really really love it so no liner just lashes then I'm going to take that gold digger shade on any brush that you choose and I'm going to push on my lower waterline if you let me push the water line will flip out and you can get an easier application without causing wrinkles and tugging on that lower waterline it might seem weird that I'm using eyeshadow instead of eyeliner but for people who have sensitive eyes eyeshadow can actually work better because it doesn't hurt or burn your eyes at all as opposed to some liners and it really will stay for a long time and I was going to call my lower lashes with lashes with mascara black mascara and this should be your eye looks so far so very gold very warm not overboard in the orange right I think it's the perfect amount of orange then we're going to go in with math care blend press powder in the shade dark using the NARS eat a brush I'm going to lightly contour i do not want to do a heavy contouring but i do want to do a little so we are just going to buff this out on the cheekbone and then around the temples and the hairline I typically don't like to go too far down on my forehead i like to leave a nice circle in the center of the forehead as a highlight and then I just contour by the hair line on the outer portions of my forehead make sure you blend then we're going to go in with backup cosmetics songbird blush this is such a pretty color we are going to start an apple of the cheeks and just work backward blending into that contour and a going backward on the face towards the temple to make sure you lightly dust and blend and then we're going to go in with mac global glow this is a newer highlighter to mac and this is my first time using it and as you can see i am already a fan this is really beautiful on someone with my skin tone over top of a blush if you want to use this as a specific highlight on the face you're going to be a few shades Tanner that I am now we're going to go in with the mac limited edition lipstick in the shade would rose this is very similar to blankety so it would be ideal for somebody who is again a shade or two darker and skin tone than me i'm getting all you ten girls many recommendations throughout this video then i'm going to go over that with color your smile coral crazy which is a new lip gloss by them it is a nudie peachy pinky coral shade it is absolutely beautiful so after that your look is complete I hope that you guys enjoyed this video I love you so much as a way to talk to you soon bye hey guys today I'm finally going to be doing a makeup tutorial using the morphe 5o palette and I am so excited to be doing this you guys because it is so highly requested not to mention i'm using this palette off-camera literally almost every single time I do my makeup i'll use at least a shade or two because I'm still in love with it but I haven't been able to do a tutorial on it because the fact that it has been sold out for the past six to eight weeks so it is finally back in stock and I wanted the time I video out so the day came back in stock is the day I feel my video on with life so that is why it has taken me a long time to film this video but this is the 350 palette right here as you can see it is a fall I shadow dream I mean at least it's my dream when I saw this palette it was like like you know the heart I'd emoji that was me in the 350 when we first connected it was a very very magical little bit past couple of months I feel like more feet pallets have been like on steroids like I am so ridiculously impressed with how pigmented and smooth and buttery it's been a while reviews that word I want to sit here and tell you that morph use the exact same qualities like makeup geek but i will say that they are getting closer and closer with every palate because this palette really impresses me I did reach out to more fee and I just straight up asked them if they would be willing to give you guys a little bit more of a discount code because of the fact that I post this on Instagram about two months ago rating about how much I loved it and coincidentally the pallets sold out literally like 15 or 20 minutes later and so many disappointed comments and tweets and even emails that i asked them if they'd be willing to give you guys a little bit more of a discount code to help make up for the fact that i did post about it and then it was just gone so they did agree to get you guys fifteen percent off and this is only gonna last for five days because they do not do fifty percent off my normal discount code jack attack is only for ten percent and that is an affiliation code but they are going to up it to an extra five percent for you guys just for a limited time of five days for those of you who really really want to get this palette but you couldn't so I hope that that's is exciting to you guys because i was really excited when they agreed to it because i know its hands of you were really disappointed about not getting this keep in mind this palette does sell out again it is a permanent items palette is not going to be gone forever does sell out a couple of times they will keep coming back it's not limited edition so don't worry you will be able to get your paws on i have some point so yeah that's not I'm translators anything else I have to say oh yeah i did get a spray tan earlier this week and you know i like the way it came out of my body my skin on my face is not having it and I literally have like alligator skin and has dry patches all over the place so in the tutorial if you're wondering what the heck is going on with her skin it's just my spray tan is all going to be okay i'm sure my skin will be back from on a couple of days I don't know why I'm talking about such first world problems right now I you guys enjoy the video let's just get into it okay okay my thanks and gave me alligators and there are people dying in the world Jacqueline hi everybody so today we're going to be starting off with our skin first and i'm going to be priming using the new backup backlight priming filter that's a mouthful I am loving this primer because it gives your skin such intense luminosity which is great for someone like me who's looking for the glow who has dry skin etc so once i have that on i'm going to go in with foundation and i'm going to be using the Makeup Forever ultra HD stick this has been one of my favorites for the past month or so so I'm going to put a line on my chin and two lines on my cheeks that I'm gonna grab some mac fix+ and more feet foundation brush this is M 439 I'm going to give it a couple of spritz and then i'm going to just buff this out this foundation is super creamy it's very dewy so if your oily i would suggest probably staying away from this one because it definitely is going to give you a luminous dewy finish which is why i love it because I feel looks very natural on my skin since I am dry to normal so if you're looking for a dewy foundation the last for a really long time i would highly suggest this one I love it and a little bit goes a very long way and it's a medium coverage which is great because recently I haven't been inside the full intense coverage like I used to so now i'm going to conceal my under eye area and i'm using the Urban Decay ultimate coverage concealers that's what it's called about sure but you guys know what i mean i'll link it down below this is my absolute favorite concealer at the moment I honestly think it's my favorite concealer of all I'm you guys it's just so high coverage while still remaining hydrating because sometimes a really high coverage concealer can get really dry on the under eye area and make it look kind of creepy and unsettling even more this is just like the perfect amount of hydration while still being full coverage so i love it i am using a real techniques damp beauty sponge to blend this out and then i'm going to go in and set the entire under eye area using the Kat Von D shade light palette this is her highlight contour kit and these to highlight shades are basically my favorite highlight shades ever i really wish that she would sell these individually and not just in the kit because i would buy them in the pan like hot cakes because i love the formula of these so much so I'm going to make sure i said that entire area in the v all the way down the side of my nose up towards the temple and then i'll also dust it over the eye area that way at prime is my eyes for shadow and shadow will go on a lot smoother so now we're going to go in with the morphe 35o and we're going to pick up this first shade right here and we're going to mix it with the other one that I'm pointing out that they don't have names so I'm just like this one and this one it's like a light brown and a medium tone brown one is a very neutral and a little bit more is like a camel e warm shade so going in initially with the m4 for one brush this is my morphe it's kind of a long haired blending brush I'm going to put this right in my crease all the way in the inner corner and blend out all the way to the outer corner add the product begins to leave my brush I'm then going to go upwards and start buffing this out towards my eyebrow then I'm going to pick up this kind of burnt reddish shade very warm one of my favorites it reminds me of like a mack brown script or a makeup geek cocoa bear and just going in with the exact same & 441 brush I'm going to begin to put that right over top of the first two shades that we initially went in with and i'm going to again go back and forth and I'm really making sure i go deep into that inner corner of the eye and then all the way outward and then again buffing it up and then i'm going to go in with an even a red shade and i'm going to mix it with this one in the center of the palate this is going to give me a really really rich red brown this is what's going to bring a lot of that warmth in those red tones - this looks so if you don't like those red tones go with a more medium brown in this palette but you guys know that I can't get enough so that is what i am doing and I'm going in an e 17 brush my morphe to initially pack on this red brown color and the inner and the outer corner and then i'm going in with an m4 33 and just making sure that it's all blended out and we don't have harsh lines this East 17 brush is great if you're really looking for something small and dense you can really precisely pack on color but yet you still have some blending control it's a little bit bigger than a pencil brush so it's still have that blending shape to it which makes it so great an ideal for something like this so as you can see i'm leaving the center of my lid blank because we're going to go in and put something in the center so now i'm going to go in on those - dark Browns the very bottom and i'm going to mix those together because since i have 5 colors i might as well use as many as possible so i just keep mixing them and going back in with the exact same East 17 I'm going to begin to pack that super dark color on the outer corner of the eye because I just wanted to be a little bit more intensified out there then going back in with the m4 33 which is just a great blending brush I'm going to just go over the entire area all the way from inner corner to outer corner to make sure that it's all blended out we don't have any harsh lines now picking up this pale orange shade that reminds me a lot of makeup geek tickety i'm using the same blending brush i'm just going to put this at the very top of the crease just make sure that everything is nice and blended out and we have a smooth transition and now i'm going to pick up this very bottom intense oh my gosh I don't even know what to refer to the shade as it's just gorgeous I'm wetting my brush with a little bit of fixed plus i'm going to begin to pack this color on so i wanted to be super metallic make sure that when you wet your brush with 6 plus that you don't get soaked otherwise it's going to kind of meet the purpose and you're not going to pack that much product on so just a little spritz will do and then you'll get that really intense foiled pigments had look that I'm going for so this shade as you can see is super or super warm it reminds me a lot of makeup geek flamethrower which is one of their foiled eyeshadows especially when you wet your brush with fix plus it looks like a foil shadow which is why i use fix+ so often because you can completely change your eyeshadow look with just a spritz of fix+ now i'm going to pick up a super dark color at the bottom of the palette either one of these shades would do and i'm going to use a sigma e 15 definer brush to pack on the shade on to the lower lash line and I'm literally going to draw this color from the outer corner to the inner corner of my by using this definer brush and then once we have that intense dark shade on i will go in and blend this out so it's not so harsh of course otherwise it looks like you drew it on with a sharpie so picking up a little bit more of this burnt right shade and a pencil brush I'm going to just blend this out from the outer corner to the inner corner i really like my under eyes to personally be smoky I think that they open up my eyes they bring more attention to your eye color and they just give you a really intense global smokey look so I always really blend that out on the lower lash line so now i'm going to fill in my brows nothing special i'm using the Anasazi of broadway is in the shape taupe Anasazi as browse is my favorite pencil of all time when it comes to browse when I switched from the mac 12 Anastasio one it was just like that having gates open because i love it so much so I am lining my waterline with a vanilla shade pencil but i'm actually going to take that off in a minute or two and replace it with a black because i realized i wasn't feelin myself so I'm going to go in with this highlight shade and a teeny tiny little brush this is an e36 from morphe and it's ideal for highlighting your inner corner of your eyes i've been loving it recently it's the little things in life I swear to God literally so after I highlight my inner corner i'm going to pop just a little bit of that same shade only at the high point of the brow and kind of blend it downward onto the shadow itself now i'm just going to give my lashes a coat of mascara because i am going to prep them for lashes don't feel like you need to wear lashes but I'm a last girl and I wear them all the time so i'm gonna pop some on and today i am using the new Sophia lashes by Sophia chang who is known as fashionista 804 here on Instagram she collaborated with velour to make these lashes and i have to say they're one of my favorite styles by them i love them so much and i will definitely be showing you guys them again because they are so gorgeous perfect for a smoky eye I've been wearing them with minor without liner on a day-to-day basis on a smoky basis so I'm all about these lashes right now congratulations girl so I am a scurrying my love mascara i am putting mascara on my lower lashes and then i'm going in with some eyeliner this is the ardency Inn eyeliner in black because I realized I was not liking that vanilla liner I wanted something a little bit smoke year so I went over it with a black kohl little bit and just completely cover it up and made it darker and smoke year which i liked way better and then I go back and with that same Sigma 15 definer brush and just kind of smoke out and blend out that liner since you can't see what I'm doing some looking straight down i'm explaining it to you instead so now for cheeks i'm going to be using the mac cosmetics sculpting powder in the shade shade stirrer which I've talked about a few times i love it so much and i am using the NARS eat a brush which I have really fallen in love with recently and I'm going to be contouring my cheeks and I'm doing kind of a hike on tour today meaning i am sculpting starting a little bit higher by the ear and bring it down a more intense decline down by the mouth because i wanted to get that kind of sharp intense contour and i'm just going to blend that around on the forehead and i'm going to pick up some of the laura mercier translucent powder and then i am using this intense sculpting brush from morphe and what I'm going to do is put this powder right underneath my contour and I'm going to blend it all the way down on the rest of the face by the jaw bone this is going to set that powder so that I'm sorry set that foundation so that it doesn't wear off throughout the day because my foundation always leave the lower half of my face because I'm like leaning on my arm or something and I'm going to go in and blend all of that out and just immediately erase it so that everything is nice and set and sharp sharp and then i'm going to go in with some blush and this is the NARS luster blush and i'm using the morphe e4 blush brush I love this blush I don't know how old it is I don't even know if it's still available but if it is i will link it down below if i can find it but i have been loving it and now i'm going to highlight my cheeks using what do you what do you know champagne pop I'm so surprised i'm so surprised i'm using champagne pop aren't you using a more fee and 50 1 i'm going to just dust this all over the very high points of my cheeks and then blending it downward today I'm keeping it more on the high points and not so much on the apples I usually blend it down there but not today i'm going to go in with a very nude lip to begin I wanted to show you guys options so this is occ lip tar in the shade interlace and i'm going to go over it with one of my favorite with glasses at the moment which is nars Chelsea girl so you can see what this look would look like if you chose to do a nude lip i personally like this i think it's very pretty but i wanted to do something a little more dramatic because i rarely do bold and bold but recently I've been having fun with these fall looks so i'm going to show you what it looks like when we go to a bold lip and bull dies so i am using the Anasazi lip tar lip paint I'm sorry in the shade vamp and i'm going to put that all over my entire lips as normal I'm not going to go too hard on the center of the lip though because I'm about to cover that up with a little bit of a person and i am going to just dab this right in the center of the lip and tapping motions on the bottom and then I'm going to take my finger once I have this tapped all over the center and i'm going to begin to just kind of balance my finger up and down on my lips to blend this out we're doing an ombre lip but I didn't want it to be too intense or over the top so I'm just pouting and buffing this out with the tip of my finger and I want the most intense of this brightness to be in the very very center of the lip like you just got them sucking on a strawberry that's how it's supposed to look so what we've done that I'm going to set my base with Urban Decay Jill makeup setting spray and this look is complete so I hope you guys enjoy thank you so

that I will wear off of camera because it's so requested I know you guys want to see it so i'll do it for you but this look is something i will personally wear again for sure I love this look and especially because i put a creamy white eyeliner on the waterline it kind of made a little bit different a little bit more daytime appropriate if you want to darken it up and they get more sexy he's not work on camera just so uncomfortable with like you want to make this sexual but if you want to make this more night time appropriate and smoky just do a black color on your waterline and this may get much deeper and more intense so I hope that you guys enjoyed this tutorial thank you so much for watching and love you guys go follow Kathleen I'll see you soon bye first thing I'm going to do is prime my face i'm using makeup forever radiance primer using clean fingers of course because we do not want to spread any bacteria or germs I'm going to massages all over my entire face then I'm going to take the same makeup forever line using the smoothing primer I'm going to take this and just rub it in my t-zone I know this seems excessive to use two primers but I've just been loving the way it makes my skin look recently them for extra hydration because i am dry i'm going to spread some max mac fix+ all over my face and I'm going to go in with my foundation I've been loving the dior new dare serum foundation recently I've raved about a couple of times it's just my absolute favorite at the moment it's a shared medium coverage just looks so natural and blends beautifully and i am using the Sigma f80 flat top kabuki to just massage that and blend it all over my entire face then we are going to go in with urban decay and naked concealer I'm going to put this in the entire under eye area and a triangle shape kind of down the side of my nose and up towards my temple and i will also put on my eyelid and i will blend that out with a damp Beauty Blender the reason i put on my eyelid is because it will help me prime for eyeshadow i don't usually use an actual eye shadow primer this is my way of priming and color correcting at the same time I'm gonna take that same highlighter i'm going to put on the top to the cheeks the chin the Cupid's bow the center of the nose and make a little flower in the center of my forehead as well just to kind of even out that very subtle highlight it's not that light but it's kind of then i'm going to set the under eye area with some powder and move forward i'm going in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow as my first shade i am using a sigma e40 eyeshadow brush to blend this out this is just an absolute must color for me it just works so great with my skin tone and it works for a transition shade to make all the colors that i use blend seamlessly it just works for my skin tone it might not work for everyone but i honestly can't live without it now i'm going to go in with ardency Inn eyeliner and this is in the shade black what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to smudge this all along my lash line just very messily not doing anything in particular then with any brush this is a morphe brush ride on the number i'm sorry but i'm going to just blend this out back and forth and you do not have to make it a seamless blending application just blending it upwards this is going to help give our lash line depth when we go in with more shades now i'm going to go in with the first shade which is called Cornelius I'm going to go in with an e 25 brush from sigma and just put that in the entire crease area going back and forth and windshield wiper motions all the way to the inner corner all the way to the outer corner back and forth I want this to be just as dark in the inner corner as I do in the outer corner I really want this to be very rounded and very smoky now i'm going to go in with my favorite color which is blaze i'm using my finger to apply this because honestly it's just what's going to work best so why not use the best tools that God gave you so using my minutes middle finger I'm going to rub that in the eye shadow and Pat it all over my entire lid once i have packed a good amount of that on going to go back and with the e25 brush from sigma and blend it out because if you just use your finger it's going to be kind of hard not to have harsh lines so i'm going to go in just to make sure that's completely blended and then I will pack even a little bit more on the center of my lid because I wanted to be really intense in the very center of my lid then going in with the shade kathleenlights I'm going to pack this on the center of the lid as well and i'm using a mac 242 brush I don't know why I even picked up the brush it's not necessary just use your fingers for this part as well because I go back in with my fingers you can see and I kind of blend that together I just wanted an extra pop right in the center of that lid I'm going to fill in my eyebrows with anastacio browse in the shade taupe but i'm going to skip right through that because you've seen you fill my brows and it's just not fun to watch so now i'm going to take the exact same colors that i use on the upper lid and i'm going to put them on the lower lash line literally the same thing in the same order i'm going to put them on the lower lash line I'm taking the e25 from sigma and I'm going to meet that outer corner and very softly kind of smoke it out so it gives a very subtle kind of cat I appearance with that light medium brown shade as you can see it's very subtle but it kind of brings the eyes outward and upward then i'm going in with an e 15 from sigma and i'm going to go back in with the shade blaze and just coat the whole lower lash line then grabbing a pencil brush I'm going to go in with kathleen lights for just a really big full glow on top all three shades that are on the top right up on the lower lash line and then we are going to separate them by going in with a very creamy kind of ivory white pencil this is a mac pro pencil so I will link it down below for you guys in the description bar if you're having a hard time finding it i'll make it easier for you this is my favorite white pencil ever because it's not too white it's got a very kind of fleshy creamy vibe to it and it just gives a very different look when you're working with a smoky eye and makes it much more daytime appropriate then you can exchange it for a black eyeliner at night and make it more night appropriate I'm going to be going in with lashes and today I'm using a brand called wink wink lashes in the style Tribeca I love these because they're fluffy and their girly but yet they also have like kind of a spike eNOS to them and they give a lot of definition to the iso they're absolutely beautiful now i'm going to go in and cut my lower lashes with mascara whatever mascara will do my favorite lower lash mascara as always is mac duggal blacklash there's something about the wand it's just so small precise it's just my favorite for lower lashes now i'm going to go in and bronze my face well it started off with the idea of bronzing and then it kind of turned into contour whoops sorry story of my life i am using the Wayne Goss brush number 13 which is a beautiful brush for bronzer application and i am using hoola bronzer benefit to do this i'm going to just give my cheeks definition and i'm also going to sculpt the forehead as well and i will just blend until my arms hurt and my hands feel like they're going to fall off and then I'm going to go in with a lighter shade i'm using the anastacio banana powder i believe using the kat von d brush that came out with her shade light palette i'm just going to do this because this helps give just the face and more sculpted look because like i said at first I wasn't playing on contouring but then I was like I changed my mind I want to contour so here we go we're doing it I'm going to contour underneath I'm sorry highlight underneath the eyes and on the forehead as well to even everything out then going in with becca songbird blush blush is my current obsession I am so in love with it it is so absolutely ridiculously beautiful as you can see right here on camera it is just the most gorgeous war me pinky amazingness that ever happened to my cheeks now i'm going to go in with the new color pop highlighter and this is in the shade smokin whistles such a gorgeous shade so I do recommend recommend using this with your finger you can use a brush as you see me doing right here but I'm going back and forth between two morphe brushes applying this but honestly if you just use your finger it'll work absolute beautiful because I ended up just using my finger to do my chin and my Cupid's bow was kind of a smooth kind of squishy moose e water-based highlight so it is what it is use your finger you'll be good then I went in with the same Cornelius eyeshadow and just put a little bit underneath my lower lip just to give kind of a fuller powder your lower lip going on i'm going to use colour-pop lippie Stix in the shade bounded which is my favorite nude pink ever buy them and then i'm going to finish off this look with Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray and your look is complete so I hope that you guys enjoy this video thanks so much for watching I love you and I'll see you soon hey guys so today I'm going to be doing a makeup tutorial on this look right here obviously I'm so unprepared for this intro because i'm actually getting ready to leave for dinner i'm actually leaving in about 30 minutes from now and i thought that i would fill message like send up all my equipment and record myself getting ready for tonight because i knew i wanted to do something super dramatic so i thought was recorded make it easy so I'm very unprepared for this intro i have seen no idea i'm calling this look all I know is I came across an old photo of me and john from when I was 18 years old and I'm wearing like this exact smokey eye except there was a little little junkie but that's okay um I used to rock these colors like every day for a year and a half and when I saw this picture i was like i am not done those colors and such a long time so I felt very inspired to redo the look that used to wear and I was 18 years old so I absolutely love love the smoky eye we are working with gold and cranberries and purples it's such a pretty color combination and I made it really dramatic and really edgy as you can tell I really smoke - I made like an intense cat I knew of course the modified for your face - what fits your needs you do not have to make it as edgy and angular's I did you can soften it a little bit not as much product but you don't mean I'm going to do it all I'm gonna do it all so yeah I hope that you guys enjoy this video thank you so much for watching I Love You a season hey guys well hello let's transform this message shall we ok let's get started first thing I'm doing is priming my eyes as always and i still use the mac pro longwear concealer because it's just my absolute favorite way to prime my eyes ever then I'm going to be going in with the one the only scotch tape any brand of table work but i'm using scotch just using a tiny bit like an inch inch and a half of tape and I'm going to put on the back of my hand I'm going to peel off put on my hand again peeled off again this is just going to take a little bit of the stickiness away so it's not too harsh on the eye area what I'm going to do is put this underneath the eye and a diagonal line from the corner of my eye up to my brow really focusing and concentrating because I want them to be as symmetrical as possible because it'll make your life a whole lot easier if they're symmetrical to begin with I'm going to go in with makeup geek Peach Smoothie eyeshadow I know I know ok you can use maxima silk bamboo you can use bobby brown toast they all have a similar vibe to them but makeup geek peach smoothie that is like my ride or die that's my girl so I'm going to blend that in the entire crease from inner corner to outer corner and then I'm going to go and with makeup geek creme brulee this is another go to shade for me and that personally works for my skin tone for a great transition color and my crease whatever works for you will ever go to call that you have in your collection that will work just fine for this look so i am using a sigma e40 to blend this back and forth all the way from the inner corner to outer corner and then i'm going to go in with a little bit more precise brush I'm using the morphe em for three three for this you can also use a sigma e25 if you have that brush as well and i'm just going back in with creme brulee and the crease just to make it a little bit more dark then i'm going to be going in with an emergency in shadow and the shade copper I don't know why this is called copper because as you can see it is not a copper color i did a wet in my mac 242 brush with a little bit of fix plus because I wanted just to be super metallic and very vibrant and shiny and I inner corner this is a beautiful pure gold like it looks like a bar of gold which is why I love it so so much so i'm going to put that on the whole inner corner area and then just kind of fade out in the middle of the lid I'm not going to cover my entire lid with this just focusing on the inner corner of the eye then i'm going to go in with one of my old school all time favorites this is Mac copper ring eye shadow I told you guys before how back in my mac days other fellow like employees would call me copper ring because I would wear this every single day that it became my nickname so using that same 242 brush I'm going to pack that right over top of that gold and the center of the lid and then i'm going to go in with one of my favorite Purple's of all time and this is deep damson again this is by Mac this is a pro color i believe it's still a pro color I don't know if matt has changed in the last couple of years but you can get on that cosmetics . com just like anything else that is a pro product so using a pencil brush i am just going to really focus this on that outer crease of my eye this is where that tape really comes in handy because you can be as messy as you want to be and that tape is going to keep it nice and sharp and clean for you which is why i absolutely love this method so as you can see i'm just packing it all over that outer corner kind of focusing on that v-shape and then taking it up into the crease try to keep this purple as low as possible in your crease and don't take it too initially because as we start to blend it will begin to go higher and higher so try to initially keep that purple nice and low that way the more you blend the higher it goes i am using the morphe and 433 brush to again blend this up and then I'll go back in with the sigma e40 just to make sure that there are no harsh lines you know how it is you go from bottom to top and then you blend blend blend you want to use the smaller blending brushes for the bottom and the bigger for the top so as you see I'm using a pencil brush now then i'll go and with the morphe and 433 then i'll go on with the bigger the e-40 picking up a little bit of cocoa bear by makeup geek now which is another one of my absolute favorite shadows we're going to put just a little bit of that in the crease area because I felt like that purple wasn't blending as seamlessly as I wanted it to so sometimes picking up another shade will just really help with the blending process making it look super smooth which is why i use that now i'm going to go back and was a little bit more coppering because in that blending process I felt like I kind of lost the pop of that copper shade and I really want to have a nice gradient transition from gold to copper to purple so we're going to touch that up in the center of the lid now i'm going to go ahead and remove the scotch tape and you can see the big reveal of what we have on that outer corner now due to the scotch tape i'm going to use a face wipe any sort of makeup remover will do and i'm just going to clean up this under eye area because you'll see like everything kind of disappear we had tons and tons of fault that you don't always notice but when you have that scotch tape you can really see all that follow on the cheek so i'm going to remove all of the fall that we have that i'm going to go in with a q-tip because sometimes using scotch tape that line can be super duper harsh so using a clean cotton q-tip i will just go in and kind of rub back and forth and this will soften that line so that it's not like whoa that's intense and I'm saying it will make it just a little bit softer on the outer edges now i'm going to be doing my finer i'm using Maybelline as always this is like my favorite eyeliner ever it is from the drugstore the price is right and I swear like there's no i mean i've ever used that is a gel liner they're like better than this one so i am very thankful for maybelline making this liner and as you can see because we use that scotch tape to make that really precise harsh line on the edge it really acts as a great guide for your wing the liner which is awesome because it makes it that much easier now i'm going to cut my lashes and any mascara will do for this because i'm going to be going in with false lashes anyways i'm going to be using a lily lashes in the style Mykonos these are my new favorite lashes this is the fourth time I have worn the style and I'm just the one love with them they are very dramatic if you haven't heard of Lily lashes yet they are awesome i just tried them for the first time this past month and i'll link them down below for you guys who want to go ahead and check it out for yourself now i'm going to be priming my skin using and make up for ever radiance primer and the reason I'm using the radiance primer today is because I'm gonna be going in with the LC cosmetics mikrosil foundation and as I have talked about this foundation before it is a little bit more on the dryer matte side so i like to use a radiance primer and i'm also going to spritz my brush with some mac fix+ this is the m4 39 foundation brush that I've been raving about I swear this brush the foundation are a match made in heaven and i am currently between the shade natural and sand depending if I have self tan or not I know if you people have asked about my shade in the LC foundation and if you guys are wanting to try it i do have a limited coupon code it's not going to last too much longer and i will put that down below for you guys again thank you so much too late for giving this cold because i was very generous of her so now i'm going to be filling in eyebrows i'm using the Anasazi or browse in the shade taupe and I have actually really changed the way I do my brows I make them much center now and I'm just very happy with them they're not overboard like I feel like they used to be so yay for finally feeling like my brows are getting to a happy place I'm going to be concealing my under eye area using my absolute obsession at the moment which is this Urban Decay Naked concealer i know i say in every video but i swear this like my favorite concealer of all time I think this concealer would work the best for all different skin types if you have fine lines if you have wrinkles to dry under area whatever it may be it is just an amazing amazing consider that will work for so many different people so i am using this in a shade lighter than my skin tone so because of that i will also put a little bit of it on the chin in between the eyebrows and a little dab of it on the center of the forehead as well just to balance out that highlight and other areas of my face because I don't we just want the under eyes to be a highlight i really want to kind of balances out so that it looks morning actual I know natural really huh full face of makeup but still it will actually balance out and make everything come together much more beautifully in the end and then i'm going to set my under eye area with powder so I don't have any creasing and i am using the anastacio banana powder that comes in her contour kit and it's also sold separately on her website and I mix that with the mac pro emphasize which is like a stark white powder i mix those two together from my personal perfect highlight shade and i will just go ahead and set the under eye now i'm going to go in with who faced a bronzer ok if you watch my husband tag then you know i am saying food face we're going to be going in with the to face and bronzer this is the chocolate Soleil one and i am using an oldie but a goodie and this is the NARS eat a brush you guys know that this has been like a rider die brush for me and then I wasn't using it for quite a while and i am back on the e to brush big time I love it so much for contouring i still stand behind this brush so much i just think it is amazing it's just a foolproof for contouring I swear it just makes it so simple so I also going to be browsing the forehead just to even that out as any time i contour I always have to go on the temples and the hair line just to make everything come together and i am using the morphe for brush I use this for bronzing i use it for contouring i use it for blush I've told you guys this brush is just like my favorite thing right now it's just got the smoothest bristles it's just so easy to work with now I'm going to line my waterline this is like the creepy shot ever right I was like you was so we're just gonna go ahead and cut that i use the arden see in black eyeliner to line my inner water line and then using a precision brush this is the sigma e 15 flat definer we're going to take a little bit more of that purple that deep damson i'm going to just rub that all over the lower lash line all the way from inner corner to outer corner and then taking a pencil brush this is the morphe 18 with a little bit of that copper ring shade on it I'm going to lightly dust over so we have that purple and that copper smoked out underneath the lower lash line and then i'm going to coat my lashes with mascara you can see that doing that to the lower lash line really pull this look together and just makes everything look super smoky and it makes your eyes pop i'm going to be using a mac Melba for my blush which is one of my all-time favorites it's a matte blush and it's beautiful on a very wide range of skin tones that I used to sell this blush more than any other shade when i worked at Mac because it just looks gorgeous on everybody it's so easy to wear and now of course we are going to be highlighting and i'm going to be using a champagne pop the highlighter that i created with becca cosmetics because i can't get enough of the shade right now let's get real i'm going to be using the morphe and 501 brush to apply this on the high points of my cheekbones this is my favorite highlighter brush until something better comes along this has been this has been my ride or die for my highlights and i'm also going to be taking a champagne pop and putting it right on the top of that brow bone just to kind of tie that whole look together i love how am I brow bone especially if i'm doing a super smoky look I just think that polishes it off I'm going to go in with house of dollars lipstick and the shade she is a very nude pale peachy pink as you can see extremely nude so i added a mineralized glass from Mac over top of it man a lot of a lot of mac products today I didn't mean to do that i am using the shade be nice which is a beautiful coral shade one of my favorite glosses especially by mac and then finish it off i'm going to use some fix+ and we are done call it a day I hope you guys enjoy this look thank you so much for watching you know I love you and I'll see you soon bye guys hey guys so today's tutorial is

in with the LC a mikrosil foundation and i am using the morphe and 439 foundation brush and I did spritz it with some map fix plus because mac fix+ has glycerin in it and it's ninety percent water so it just makes the skin super hydrated and actually helps the foundation to stick to your skin and to the foundation itself for concealer today i'm going to be using the new make up for ever HD concealer this is my third time now using it and I am loving this concealer it goes on very very creamy I was nervous it's going to be super Creasy when I first applied it was very very dewy and very creamy but this is like I said my third time trying it and i've set it with powder each time and i have been loving it it's very full coverage it blends out really beautifully I'm not getting any creasing throughout the day it looks nice and natural i'm i'm really loving you guys so now i'm going to set everything using the laura mercier loose translucent setting powder i'm going to make the most attractive face of life to set the under eye area as always and i'm going to run this brush across my entire face i'm going to completely a mattify myself which I actually wish I didn't do once this look was overall i wish i was a little bit do here for this specific look but that's okay because life goes on even when you have a mad face so now for the eyes and you start off using the mac shadow in the shade kid and I'm initial going in with the morphe m4 for one brush I'm going to try to keep this high up in the crease area as you can see i'm not going to go on the lid because of the fact that we're doing a cut crease the shadow kid is absolutely amazing if you are looking for an amazing a transition color that's not too warm not too cool I would really highly suggest the shade kid it's so wearable now i'm going to go in with Bobby Brown cement and as you can see this is a very nice light pale cool grey and now i'm using a smaller blending brush and this is the morphe and 433 because we're gonna get a little bit tighter in that crease as you can see i'm still not going on the lid I'm staying just in that crease area and want to keep it only in that upper crease now another bobby brown eyeshadow this is hot stone which is just a darker gray from the cement I'm really going one step at a time because when you're doing a cut crease you don't want to initially just go on like with this intense dark color it's gonna be kind of difficult to blend out so I like to start with a light shade and go one darker one darker one darker and that's really going to give you that really beautiful blended effect so that's just you know lessons and blending 101 now we're going to go in with anastacio deep brown this is a very deep brown one hundred percent cool shade and now i am using the morphe and 507 and this is a very Stinney precise brush that's perfect for look like this when you're doing a cut crease so as you can see I'm only keeping this on the outer corner of the eye I'm not going to bring this all the way into the inner corner otherwise we're gonna start to look very 60s which is super cool but not what i'm going for in this specific look so I'm keeping it on the outer corner and I want the main darkness to be right on the outer edge of my eye and kind of faded up as we go then I'll go back with that 433 brush and just make sure it's blended out I was just going back in with a little bit of kid or cement one of those light shades on your brush just a little bit just to blend that out so that nothing is harsh again avoiding the actual lid area strictly staying on the upper crease once i blended that I realize I want to just a touch more of the anastacio so I went back in which is a little bit more of deep brown now we're going to go on with this makeup forever palette this is a new palette a sephora i love these shadows they are so pigmented so beautiful and I wanted to go in with this really bright white if you don't have this palette i would suggest something like mac crystal avalanche or like mac vanilla pigment you could even just using the next like jumbo white pencil but i really love the shadows and I had the palate sitting in front of me so I wanted to use them and as you can see they are pigmented as heck this is not using a wet brush or anything this is just the color payoff which is so amazing so I am using a mac 242 to apply that which is just a flattop synthetic hair brush and that will any flat synthetic brush will apply it like shimmers the best and now we're gonna be going in with mac platinum pigment this is my favorite silver of all time it is a true true silver platinum and I'm going to put this on the middle of the eye and the outer area of the I i really wanted to be kind of on break the inner corners stock white and a face like a platinum silver so using that same 242 I'm going to begin to press down on the outer corner of the eye and I'm going to actually going to use it to clean up that cut crease so if you were messy at all you have any fall on your lid this is your time to really kind of carpet and go back and forth to make it nice and sharp again i'm taking a little bit more of the Anasazi a deep brown and that same more feet 507 brush I'm going to put a little bit more just to make sure that it's nice and sharp but yet still blended that make sense to shop and whether you got me you're keeping up so now we're going in with mac pro emphasize this is a highlighting powder and i'm going to just put that in the inner corner of the eye to really highlight I'm going to dabble a little bit over that inner corner highlight that we have going on I'm going to bring it all the way up so it's kind of going towards the brow area to make everything nice and soft and i'm going to bring it underneath the eye area about halfway and on that lower lash line I really wanted the inner corner of my eye to pop and look very icy so I was putting a lot of this all over that inner rim but I didn't want it to be too frosty that's why I didn't go in with like mac nylon I wanted to still have kind of a mat inner corner of the eye that's why i chose that now for my brows i am using the Anasazi railways as always i'm so excited for her new brow product to come out have you guys seen her pencil on her instagram i'm like dying i'm so excited to try it because im so diehard for the brows I love it so much so I can't wait anything that she developed for the brows I'm so fangirl about it's ridiculous now i'm going to go in the house of lashes boudoir eyelashes god I just love the name of these lashes they're just so fun to say i was going to pop those on the upper lash line as you see i did not apply any liner go ahead and apply some minor if you want you can do a wing you can do a smokey liner you can do just a straight line whatever you want but I don't want to apply any liner I wanted to keep this look nice and simple and i'm going to go back in with that same anastasi a deep brown again I'm gonna pop that on the lower lash line and I'm going to keep that strictly on the outer corner of my eye only I do not want to bring it in and start getting that lower lash line to smokey I want to really keep that highlight nice and bright on the inner corner and then using any pencil brush I'm is going to buff it out I did put a little bit of kid on my pencil brush that we have a lighter color to buff it out because it's hard to buff out of color not using a lighter one so since i put the dark one I pick up a little bit of a lighter shade and I buff it out so it's nice and blended and smoky only on the lower half of the eye you'll see after I do this step how much like my eyes are going to look open and make them pop and that's the point of this this look and these steps i'm applying is a vanilla liner it does not matter which one because what I'm going to do next is I'm going to go back with that exact same white that we use on the eyes the tiny little precision brush you can use a q-tip if you want i'm going to pop that right on top of my waterline and basically what we're going to do is it's going to keep that water line really bright the entire day it will also make it so that it doesn't bleed it doesn't move it doesn't fade and it's also going to make your eyes pop way more if you just have a stark white eyeliner you can use that but i did not have that I ran out I don't know where it went i haven't had it in years so this is what I did setting your liner with powder and your waterline is a really great way to make it last the entire day doe so if you guys have issues with it moving and running so now for bronzer i'm going to be using the hourglass luminous bronzer light my sister is the one that introduced this bronzer to me and it is so beautiful so i would highly suggest it for those of you who are very fair out there because my sister is very very light like milky colored skin and it looks gorgeous on her I'm not going to lie i am very flustered by how they showed up on camera it looks blotchy it it just doesn't look good it's causing me stress but we're going to move past that ok move past it for blush I'm going to be going in with the bomb our guile argyle is the name of the blush and it's just this beautiful matte babydoll pink the bomb has such great blushes and I think no one ever talks about them but they're so good there be honestly such a beautiful formulas i love them i'm going to go over that with you Bobby Brown shimmer brick in the shade pink and i'm going to put that right on the apples of the cheeks because i personally would have gone in with a light babydoll pink lip which is what I exchange it for after I got done filming and pink cheeks but i wanted to do something different because I know a lot of you guys have really been in - these kind of dark purple emami brown shades recently but i really love a pink lip with this look side note for the highlight I'm using champagne pop and pearl pearl is now permanent buyback us if you're interested in that you can purchase it separately it is not just in this palette anymore they just release it which is super exciting that such a beautiful unique really really light highlight for those of you who are super fair i'm also going to highlight my Cupid's bow then i'm going to set my face using the Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray and I want to do this first before I apply these little gems on the inner corner of my eyes that way at the Urban Decay makeup spray didn't like wet in them and make them move or slide around from the wetness of the spray so I'm going to use one of these little rhinestones is a pack of like I don't know a thousand of these little rhinestones I got it from amazon it was like 299 for this pack using tweezers I'm literally just going to pop it on the inner corner of my eye it's so easy and if they don't have an adhesive on the back just put a dot eyelash glue on it wait 20 seconds and pop it on and you're good to go so easy you can put these all of your lid to which will look gorgeous for the lips i'm going to use color pop stingray this was developed by it's my right here on YouTube congratulations girl it's beautiful I've had mixed emotions about these color pop liquid lips but this one is gorgeous it's beautiful the formulas great the price point is amazing so this is a really really nice shade and i have been loving it recently so once you have your lip on you are good to go so i hope that you enjoy this video you guys thank you so much for watching I love you and I'll see you soon hey guys so today before jumping into the tutorial something a little bit more important than makeup I want to introduce you to the newest member of our family somebody from you this is mr. Frankie yeah this is not endorsed little pop body you see that beast do the news this is actually Frankie's like first official debut here on camera so how does it feel ready how does it feel to other people ok ok he is honest to god you guys at the sweetest puppy I've ever known in my life like he's just a snuggler and he's just so sleepy and adorable and sweet but he's got a science that and i wish you guys Christine him when i first got him because he's already doubled the size double he was half the size of this when I got him three weeks ago this is his first time on camera because he's finally living with us if you follow me on snapchat on Twitter and all that jazz and you would know we have had a quite the fiasco getting Georgie used to Frankie it was horrible first we've taken so much of your advice and we have also i'm got advice from a trainer as well and just kind of take it very slow and very patient and so now Frankie is home and georgian him really are getting along Georgie only has like outbursts maybe it once or twice a day holes big enough but for the most part they're doing great so it is wonderful he's such a little joy and for those of you are wondering what breed he is he's a shih tzu I've grown up wish to choose my entire life my mom's head shoes ever since before I was born and I just loved them like my favorite dogs means higher world there is little companions and they're so sweet and such great colors and they're amazing with kids so Georgie and him are both ships's he died he makes that noise every single time he on it is the cutest thing in the entire world every time you're on rolling ok so now that we have that over with today's video is going to be uh makeup tutorial lost my train of a lot of makeup tutorial on the look that i have on right here i asked you guys on Twitter if you want to see something dramatic or more natural or neutral and ninety-five percent of you guys that a dramatic drama all caps with explanations and I was like oh my god so you guys asked for it heroes I wanted to do something cool tone because you know i love my warm tones and I I feel like I'm not as intense my warm tones here my channel I used to be though I definitely transition more like neutral side because if i had my way you guys I don't you understand i would be wearing like a brick red wrapped around my eyes every day with like 3d mean clashes like that right there is life to me thank you kids so I just decided to go with a classic black and gray and silver smoky eye I've never done a look like this before I have been a silver and black tutorial but what's different about this is there's no liner there's no intense wing there's no sharp edge this is so rounded and blown out it literally looks like smoke on the eye which is just like my favorite look of all time I absolutely love it this is a very sexy it is definitely appropriate for a night out so i hope you guys enjoy if you do this video thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe and never say that like ever I'm supposed to you should just not whatever you know what to do i love you guys so much i hope you enjoyed this tutorial and i'll see you soon bye guys oh my god towards you and Frank you're legit colleague right now mama can't take it hello my love's so today we are going to be starting with our skin so i am going to go in with a primer i'm using makeup forever radiant primer and i'm going to massage this all over the skin you know the drill with primer let's move past that i'm also going to be using a new product i have not used on camera before and this is by the brand Tata and thus a luminous dewy skin miss i bought this solely because of the fact that Kim Kardashian uses it and I wanted glow so I've been trying it out and i love it i will talk more about it and an upcoming video though so just hang tight i'm going in with the LC micro silk foundation absolutely love this foundation I've been raving about it now for quite a few videos and it is like my non-stop go to i am applying that using a foundation brush by more feet this is the e 31 this is from the Elite Collection which is amazeballz now I'm going to conceal my under eye area I skip this part pretty quickly because I feel like you guys have seen me do this whole entire drill five thousand times and if you ever want updated foundation or concealer routine you know just to ask and I shall give it to you so i am just going ahead and using a damp beauty blender to blend out the Urban Decay waitlist naked concealer up towards the temple then I always take it and I put it on my chin around my nose because women can always get red there that's just due to hormones you can't escape it and then in the center of the forehead as well just to even out that very light highlight that we're doing and then also just to make things look a little bit more natural when you do consider aren't the eyes and even out other place to the face in the end it will just make everything look a little bit more put together now i'm going to set that highlight using my two favorite under I highlighting powders I am mixing both mac pro emphasize which is a pro product but you can still find out on mac cosmetics calm and anastacio banana powder which you can find separately or it comes in her contour kit the original one as well so i'm going to set the entire under eye area and also the eyelid because that will help prep our eyes for eyeshadow also the chin and the center of the forehead so that nothing moves or creases in it last all day long now we're going to go in with the eyes i'm going to be using the Kat Von D shade light eye palette can we please just admire this palette oh my god we're starting off with that matte grey shade which by the way this entire palette is Matt which is just amazing i love it when people do all mats or all summer palace I just think it's so fun so going on with that gray shade in the sigma e40 i'm going to only put this on the outer corner of the eye as you can see i'm going to do something that's gonna make a lot of people nervous and that isn't going to wrap this color completely around the eye as you can see i'm not separating the shades going in now with makeup geek barcelona beach this is not completely necessary but i love this color and just adding more and more graze on top of grey's is just going to give such a three-dimensional look and in the end it's just gonna look so smoky and so blown out i feel like the more colors i use the more seamless my eyes look so I am now using a more fee and 503 blending brush and again i'm going to put that mainly in the outer corner of the eye all over that lid area I'm going to wrap it around you really want to halo and circle that entire I I know it can be intimidating to do this because you're like wait a second i'm about to have a black eye but just do it and I'm telling you the end result is so beautiful so using this kind of like chocolatey gray color it's really interesting because its color isn't like a deep gray but it's also not a deep brown it's like a chocolaty great and it's beautiful i'm going to be using an e 22 brush my morphe and i'm going to again pack this on that outer corner I love this brush because it has a little bit of a tip so you can really get precise with it which is why I'm going on with this blending brush right now once you are done with that you're going to want to go in with a fluffy brush like the sigma e40 and just go back and forth and blend blend blend that is what's going to make this look beautiful and not look like you got punched in the face is blending so be patient and take your time i'm going in with laura mercier translucent powder and I'm going to pack that on my cheekbones come about to go in with a very intense black and I just do that that way it will catch the fall out and not get all over my face Andrew my foundation so now going in with that black from the palette and a sigma e25 I'm not just going to begin to do the same thing with this that I do with those other shades and yes Frankie was whining at my feet that's why I'm holding him here for a quick second but I'm about to put him down so I'm going to pack that on the entire outer corner but i'm also going to make sure that i am not going above my crease we're going to keep this a little bit lower than the gray colors because we don't want to go extended too high otherwise once again that can kind of make you look like a panda bear and kind of like you've been bruised the trick is to keep the black as low as possible and that the grades go up higher so keep the black low and make sure that you blend blend blend and those two things combined are going to make it so it's your smoky eye is beautiful and not too scary and not too harsh and jagged where it can look like whoa what did you do to your face because you know exactly I'm talking about we've all had that problem smokey eyes before so again with the black i'm wrapping it around the eye and again blending it out just make sure that you really take your time talk on this black very intensely and halo around the entire corner of your eye to really make it blown out and smoky now I'm going to line my waterline using using ardency Inn eyeliner this is the creamiest kinkiest blackest liner i've ever used and it does not leave my waterline all day long i'm using the e 18 pencil brush from the elite collection and all that causes pencil brush is amazing just to pack on a little bit more black now i'm going with a mac - 28 brush and this is the teeth tiniest little precision brush you've ever seen and i use this to highlight my inner corner i am currently using math shroom eyeshadow I'm sorry I didn't show you the camera show the camera the product but I was just so my zone you know how it is I'm going to pack that on really intensely on the inner corner of my eye cause I wanted to be a very very bright in our corner I mean you can go is bright white as you want and I don't think it's really going to be 2 over boards it really works since you have such a dark outer corner have a really intense bright inner corner that exact same shroom color by mac i'm going to use that all my brow bone just to highlight this to me is so necessary when you're doing like an intense smoky eye highlighting the brow bone is just going to complete that bombshell look now i'm going in with a mac pressed pigment you guys know I'm such a fan of mac press pigments I think they're gorgeous when im using the shade in lightning and i'm going to just pack that on the lid using my finger you can choose to use glitter glue it will make this easier i am using a paper towel so I don't get too much fallout because you will have fallout with the mat press pigments you really can't escape it when you're applying it unless you use glitter glue I'm gonna pop on some false lashes these are by it flutters eyelashes i'm not sure what Sally are you guys I'm so sorry i've used them like 15 times it's just like one of those things they've been sitting on my vanity I keep popping them on sanitary I know moving on now i'm going to contour my face i am using the NARS either brush I've been obsessed with this again you guys my tried-and-true died was so obsessed with his back in the day and it is back in business and i'm going to just cut my face using the too faced chocolate soleil bronzer and then I'm just of course going to even that out by bronzing my forehead as well I'm going to go in with becca sweet pea blush using a more feet e3 is this notice it before I'm sorry sweet P blushes my go-to blush and I'm doing smokey eyes because it gives just enough color to the skin but it's very neutral and it's not over the top on the cheeks now to highlight i'm going to use mary-lou manizer by the bomb it's such a beautiful neutral very vanilla shade i love love love this highlight when I'm not doing something to bronzy because it's so vanilla it just complements your eyes so incredibly well now different just look off i'm going to be using dose of colors stone liquid lipstick i believe this is a liquid lipstick but i will link it down below for you guys if you're curious and it's it's a beautiful shade though and now to set everything i'm going to go in with Urban Decay chill makeup setting spray and this look is complete I'm exhausted i think the guys got done talking like 500 miles a minute and i ran a marathon so I hope that you appreciate i hope you enjoy this video i love you so much and I'll see you soon bye guys what's up everyone welcome back to my  channel now today I'm gonna be diving in  and doing a first impressions on the new  Kylie Cosmetics "the burgundy palette" now  you guys know I loved the first one so  when I saw these color hues and this  color story I was like yassssss!  because I love reds and I'll of  Burgundy's and i just love bronze tone  shadows  this is what she looks like of course  the same drips as before but this one  has burgundy and pink and like topaz  cheers and the other one of course match  that palette so should we open her up my  room it looks something like this  now I think the color hues of this  palette speak to me a little more than  the first 1i can definitely play around  with this more and i love rusty colors I  love Burgundy's i love the transition  colors in this palette now this palette  is $42 and I know that Kylie said on  snapchat that her next palette after  this one would have a mirror so I know  everyone's gonna be asking but this one  does not have a mirror and which i don't  care i get ready in my studio or on a  vanity everyday with the mirror so i  don't really ever use pallets and use  the mirror maybe that's just me but I  know a lot of people on the go and they  do want a mirror so this one does not  have it now of course these are just my  thoughts and opinions remember i have  been a makeup artist for 15 years I  create my own formulas and i am very  educated in the beauty world so of  course people are going to run their  mouth and say whatever they want about  my thoughts but hey I always keep a hood  bitch so let's get to some swatching and  let's get to playing all right this is  the first shade naked and of course  excuse my broken nail i have a new dog  and he loves to chew on things beyond so  you see it has that really soft pretty  shimmer to it  poor sap tattoos so this is not going to  show up like it went blank skin but here  is the second shade beach it is a pretty  around warm really nice transition shade  here is the third shade is called  pinning it is a really warm orange color  BAM that is what penny looks like next  shade is called la it is a really pretty  frosty shade i think simply up the  formula in her frost because this one is  super pigmented and it is banging fifty  shades called Burgundy  it is a beautiful warm red color and I  lived for this one and the sixth shade  is called Dubai is a pretty frosty rusty  red color and I lived for this one it is  definitely way more pigmented and the  last frost shades from the bronze  palette and I live the seven shades  called break it is a reddish tone brown  really pretty  BAM the next shade is called New York  this is more deep bronzy color really  gorgeous and of course it is a frost  formula and the last shade is called  almond it is a really pretty warm tone  dark brown and it is Matt of course now  i have a little bit of lotion on my  finger so I'm just gonna add a little  bit more  alright so here are all the swatches now  let's dive in and put some on my eyes  now we're gonna be prying eyes with the  Mac painterly Paint Pot of course if you  have a favorite primer that you love now  is the time to apply and get ready to  blind so when I do these primers I like  to take it from my lid all the way up  almost to the lash line because I'm a  sick bitch gonna pop a little transition  color into my crease with this little  Bobby Brown blending brush and I'm gonna  be using shade beach which is the top  middle shade so I'm just gonna pop this  guy right in here  of course this is going to help us blend  out all of our darker shades later and  just blend effort less Lee there we go  girl gotta speak English for a minute  now right away just from blending it  it's good  good and I'm just gonna take this and  kind of go like this and kind of stop it  here so normally all used to me going  all the way down  I'm just gonna keep this right here  today and leave some room for some other  shades and because i have no brows I'm  gonna drag it a little out course if you  are not me or jenna Marbles try shutting  off your brows right now I know there's  gonna be a lot of questions about the  pigmentation how they blend now this  first color blend it a really quick  amazing so let's keep moving on now i'm  going to be using shade penny which is  the top right one and it is a warm  orangie color which I you know I love a  good little orange transition and I'm  just going with a little mac 221 brush  and we're just going to pop this into  the crease and start adding some  dimension and definition  come on now now see how it's going to  take this and stop it here again and  we're just going to go slightly down now  it's just add a little more warmth to  the lid and the crease I'm gonna be  going into the little stick my e57 brush  now i don't know if i'm going to wet the  brush with 6 plus yet it might not need  it so I'm just going to go in here a few  times  oh ok ok might not need any fucking girl  and I'm just going to do packing motions  and go on my lashline blue right now I'm  gonna merge Dubai with the other colors  and we're just gonna pack this in and of  course we're going to blend it it out  better later but we're going to lay down  the foundation of our left  all right now a lot of the times with  these colors there's a lot of fallout  because of just a shade in the pigment  but this is pretty good you guys my  cheeks are not dusted and I'm just  packing this in a really heavy and bam  all right  the lids are looking rusty and i love it  now I'm gonna be going in with this deep  topaz bronze color it's called la yes  shut up to calabasas what's up Los  Angeles i love the shade name ok so I'm  going to be taking this guy and taking  it all the way down to here and just  kind of give  get a little moment to just you know  blind fucking my life so I'm gonna be  using this little shader brush and  sometimes i like to wet the brush to  really intensify metallics but ok let's  see what happens with this guy  now this one feels really creamy already  on the brush I haven't touched it with  my finger but it feels really nice and  it's blending into the other shadows um  pretty great  alright now we're going to go in with  the bottom right shape this one is  called almond it is a dark chocolate  brown with a warm undertone and I'm  gonna be going in with that same mac 221  brush now I love these because the last  one had a lot of kickback and was a  little more powdery this one I think is  a little more fine-tuned and the formula  i think already just from playing with  them is slightly better i think the last  pilot was still fine and you know  there's so many mixed reviews people are  just crazy in general I think a lot of  people seek out and want to hate  something but so far so good and I'm  loving how these are blending so I'm  gonna take that shade almond and we're  just going to lightly place it in the  outer crease area just to darken my eye  socket and give it some fall drop now  I'm gonna be taking that same Bobby  Brown blending brush and we're gonna go  back into beach just ever so slightly  and now we're just going to go over what  we did earlier and just gonna drag it  and blend it out just so it's a little  more soft and dramatic soft dramatic  work together is that that term I think  so  all right now I think I want to smoke up  my entire bottom lashes with the middle  shade and burgundy I think this is the  start of the palette if you will  I'm just going to be going in with the  Tom Ford little pencil brush and I'm  going to do liner in a second but I just  kind of want to smoke this out and see  how it looks  I'm just gonna really gently drag it  across my entire under I'm just trying  to smoke this bitch out  oh wow this is like really creamy like  when I say smooth glide on  I'm shockingly enough just because I've  had bad experiences with other brands  usually has a lot of red fallout but  this one you know and I am clicking the  brush but it's pretty good  we're gonna go back with this guy and  dip into that almond shade and was going  to kind of blend them together and let  them merge there now having a baby or  they're dating  alright guys this is coming together i'm  really loving the smoky red eye look  it's cool now i am wearing a green  contact lenses today to give it a little  extra ryan right there  I think my brown eyes definitely could  have worked but I just kind of wanted  extra little you know this little  pizzazz if you will right now for the  last time we're gonna be dipping into  shade beach again and i'm just going to  be dragging out this now I love to drag  my eyeshadows out i love a dramatic I i  know a lot of people are like me i just  love the effect of a really beautiful  smoky eyes so I'm just gonna drag out  the colors and bam all right now for the  waterline i'm gonna be using this little  Smith 202 brush look I'm tiny that is  I'm like girl and I'm going to be using  the tart black clay pot liner was going  to be dipping into this ever so slightly  it is a really creamy and really  pigmented just how i like it and I'm  gonna be taking a little beauty blender  to hold down my eye and we're just going  to tuck this in our water line  alright BAM liner is done i usually i  love to take a pencil liner and really  make it so dramatic on the bottom but I  want this red burgundy color to just a  live and breathe and I because i love  how it looks now I definitely think  there needs to be some shimmer or  something else below the brow so I'm  gonna be trying this top sheet it's  called naked  it is a shimmery it looks almost like a  beige type of color so hopefully it's  not too dark for my skin tone but I just  kind of wanted to add a little bit below  the brow just for a little shimmer now  i'm so used to putting like stark white  colors below the brow that actually  don't mind this it looks cool i'm only  doing it from here i'm not gonna take it  all the way in I just started from right  here i'm just going to blend and merge  those colors together all right now i  think i'm gonna have to go in with this  guy again and i'm just gonna buff and  make those colors seamless this is  coming together nicely you guys im  feeling the fall fantasy  alright i think the only thing missing  is of course the lashes so I'm going to  start by applying my benefit roller  mascara roller lash if you will  now this has been my tried-and-true for  a long time and let's get to it  all right now before I apply lashes yeah  we gotta go old-school jeffree star and  I think it's time to hit the roast court  and just have a moment  all right now for lashes i'm gonna be  using in the what the fuck am I gonna be  using to you guys think I'm going with  the lower lashes the new style and I'm  the damage that of course forgot the  name of it so I know these just launched  and I've been obsessed with them for a  minute so I'm gonna pop these on and  I'll be right back  alright lashes are on i'm loving it now  i think the only thing I need to  complete this look even though this is  not a tutorial I'm fucking lipstick  right so I'm gonna be going in with the  flesh nude from tom ford one of my  ultimate favorites bamboo she's worn  down girl and let's just finish this  look  alright the lips are done i think a  classic nude lip for this dramatic is  perfect but of course if you want to do  green black blue or red please feel free  because who the hell might ever say to  not be even more creative because you  all know i love some crazy but I'm i  think the last final step is I have this  new refreshing and makeup fix makeup  spray from Armani I got it today and I'm  like you know what we have to try this  for right now and this is the Armani  prima ok girl now allegedly this is  supposed to set your face to filth and  hopefully I'm your makeup doesn't come  off so let's give it a whirl  oh my god it sprays out a lot  thank you Jesus alright this space is  set baby but i need some hair so back  alright guys this is the final look how  to add some cotton candy hair and I am  feeling the fantasy of the burgundy  palette now  final thoughts this palette is great i  know so many people are gonna want to  hate and be crazy and I know there's so  many of you that love Kylie and you're  like yes another amazing product from  her so this video is of course just my  experiences it blended amazing the  formula was great i think the only  shadow I wasn't obsessed with was the  far top one it is a little more sheer  than the rest but I remember Kylie  saying that on snapchat she wanted to be  a little more subdued so it's not a  negative it's just personally I like  really rich pigments think that she  really improved the formula from the  last palette even though i was a fan of  that one I think that this one is better  and that's just my opinion  so I think it's awesome that she is  improving the formulas and working on  everything and definitely going to be  using this and i love that it's you know  perfect for travel it's a cute little  light sighs so I think this is really  good for going to kmart back-to-school  being on your knees but no real i think  this look is a really stunning and I  want to see you guys created so find  some reds and

makeup look is done i'm loving this by its oh whoa forreal highlighting is done now real quickly i'm gonna draw on browse off-camera and I'll be right back and now that the brows are on and they're a little more higher-than-normal Ohio consume a little beauty mark hi all right we're gonna prime in these lids with a little Mac painterly I'm just gonna go over my entire lid and up to my brow bone all right now I'm really excited for today's look because i'm going to be using the hood of beauty a rose gold eyeshadow palette now I know a lot of youtubers have used this and there has been as so many mixed reviews now I think from already using this off-camera for a few looks I understand some people's concerns about the top row now these are textured shadows on the box even says best applied with your fingers now when you have really long nails like me could be a little more tricky but that's what the pinkies for now I've noticed that if you really wanted the foil shadows to be a really highly pigmented on your lid it is easy to just go on with your finger and like Pat it on and it is a blinding with a brush it could be a little bit tricky so I'm just gonna do something a little cute and fun today and i'm going to start by going in with shade saddlewood which is this one all the way down here and we use a little shadow blending brush and we're just gonna pop this in our crease for our transition shade and lets blend now with another eyeshadow blending brush I'm going to take shade henna which is this one all right there and we're also going to put that in the crease and add a little bit more in jarama to the lid if you will all right now that is a blended and I'm gonna take one of those foiled shades this one is called a rose gold now it says to just use your fingers somebody's my pinky it is the skinniest nail home that I have now when you use this with your finger like that is full pigment someone's going to take this and oh ok ok now let me try to blend that with my finger it's really hard because my nails in the way so what I'm hoping is I can blend that in with a little synthetic bristle brush now here's the thing when you go in with a brush kinda shows but not as pigmented as the finger whatsoever so I'm just gonna try to go in and blend that up this is my favorite formula know if I had no nails would be a lot easier yes hundred percent now i am going to take a little detailing brush from Mac and we're going to dip into shade cocoa which is this beautiful chocolate-brown and I'm just gonna finesse a little bit into my crease and make it even deeper and our call and we're gonna go back in to saddlewood now i'm going to smoke out the last line with bossy and then a little bit of flamingos and let's try to mix and see what we can come up with a fine I'm just gonna try this pink shade called flamingo and let's see if she wants to work now I'm just going to put this in my chair duct and blend in I know it's a little weird placement but hey I'm a fucking weirdo alright guys i am now taking a bossy and flamingo and yet i'm mixing them together and I'm creating a little kind of like smoky grungy dirty like fucked up kinda I I mean you know only the best kind and I'm just blending these together and really bringing it down so the drama is a real to you all right i definitely think I need a little bit of black and my waterline so I'm gonna take my trusty max moulder eye pencil and let's get in there alright my eyes are there looking for mold oh alright i think the only thing that this I look needs now is on some lashes and no surprise here i'm gonna be going in with my benefit roller lash mascara before we put on some falsies and just coat my entire bottom and talks ok all right now for lashes I'm gonna be going over that new bounce some in style bala and let's pop these bad boys on and see what happens now for lips today I'm gonna first start off with my own the lower liquid lipstick and shade mannequin now this is my personal and go to nude from my own brand and oh i think i could just die this one I mean this let though i think i could definitely be buried in this one ok so i was gonna add a little extra added the loss i really don't think it needs this so i want to go in with this new girl on gold little like I mean she's pretty but i'm really loving this look mad with the really glittery lid so you know what gloss we're going to save this for another video what's last I knew little setting spray all right now today I'm going to be going in with the Armani basically like a setting spray they call it that refreshing makeup fix so let's lock everything in and start praying who wanted to come up for some air I'm baby I'm just trying to set gonna gonna help you want to help me all right one for the Holy Spirit waiting for my man it takes me all right guys this look is complete alright guys this is the final goal am I i love it i think this is such a fun look a smoky crazy eyes always going to be

crease full glam a moment with bitchy winged liner and a really bright lip and of course highlight highlight highlighted everywhere so if you want to see how I did the full foundation and the doing is click the video before this one and if you want to see how I completed the look then keep on watching alright so before we get started on the full makeup Oh Betty the brows first browser on now let's get started with this look to get this smoky cut crease little type of Barbie moment that we are trying to achieve today i am going to be using my Kat Von D shade + light eye palette now we're basically going to use all shadows from his palate today I love this it's perfect as every new trade you could possibly want for a quick little easy look nothing is quick and easy about this look but you know the drill so we are going to take a little flat blending brush my trusty mac to 52 as usual and we're going to be dipping into this white color right here these are really pigmented so you don't need to use a lot and I am just going to Pat this under my in tire brow bone and we're going to let that sit for a minute we're almost going to be baking under the brows if you will now if you notice how i'm doing his little patting motions and basically pressing the powder into my skin that is going to be like the best way to get that brow highlight to never come off during the entire day we got that Urban Decay eyeshadow primer in shade and nygma and this is the quantity it's like a neutral nude Matt type of base so I'm just going to whip it out and apply now I like this because it's a really neutral look so my lids have any darkness or redness gets canceled that which is nice going to use the same brush and dab that primer all over the lid there we go cool so now the lids are primed and i'm going to go back in with that white shade again and put this on top of the primer so it's like really going to stand out oh yes now a key essential part of this look is giving your lids a lot of space so I'm going to take this and already I'm going to drag it all the way down let me turn my face a little and we're going to bring this all the way in there right there and that is going to be blank during this entire look and then we'll drag out the white and will bring it all the way out all right now it's time to start creating our wing all right now let's start carving out that socket now I'm going to mind a little higher than normal because i want to create a really big dramatic type of like smoky wing so I'm gonna be taking this morphy 514 brush I love this little detailer and we're going to be dipping into this like reddish just like a warm tone brown as like a red base to it I love this guy and we're just going to coat our entire bristles with this so I'm gonna go a little higher than normal and i'm going to sketch out my own lid which is going to be really delicate so you don't wanna go to heavy hand you want to be really light with this one and I'm going to bring that all the way and you want to create a really dramatic effect today so I'll start to soften it and you can see how I'm bringing it already down here so you're going to be really careful and then i'm going to start flicking my wrist and dragging this up a little bit so it gives it the evolution of it are being blended out I'm gonna follow and go down a little bit and out almost like a little i'm going to drag it all the way to my I brown and that's how we start and build out our socket now to get the upper part really airbrush I'm just gonna take a blending brush and I'm going to be using this transition color right here and I'm going to be mixing it back in with that Brown so we get a really nice airbrush effect for the Rockets I'm just going to go over what i did a little bit and just start dragging up so it's really nice and soft and then you can go on with your blending brush and I love to just dab right back in that really white one and we're just going to take it under the eye and we're just gonna drag it out like so so it's really carve and interaction going to go back and you guys and go just on the top again so we really soften those lines look has a lot of back and forth now it's time for a black winged liner you guys ready for that I don't even know if I'm ready for that so to get inspired for this crazy liner who if you only had like a bag of chips and a red bull today and you've just been filming and haven't had time to eat thank God for medical marijuana let's get started alright so for today's bitchy Conte winged liner i'm going to be using the YSL babydoll liner in black now I love the sky because the red sole on the end oh it is so thin you see that like tiny to accentuate the wing and fill in any missing little spots that the liquid is not do i'm going to be using the tart clay pot black liner this stuff is magic i love this i can wear makeup for 10 hours of my wing is still the leaky and now i'm going to shut my mouth hold my breath and get to winning yeah all right now that my liner is done I am ready to finish this look now if your liner does not look like it's ready to apply to be a guillotine you better go over it some more strange thing all right let's finish this we're going to go back to this little blending brush and we're just gonna jump right in there with a little bit of this one and we're just going to go right under the eyes and be really soft and we're just gonna go back and forth really lightly and start to create a little smokiness and you have got to take it all the way in because we are going to add some glitter in a second and then I'm going to bring it to where the wing starts now the bottom should be really smoked out now we're going to really accentuate the eyes and do some white doll like liner in the water line so if you really want to look plastic and artificial i mean hi that was my goal since birth you are just going to get some white liner of your choice and we're just gonna pop that into the water line and I'm going to really going on - and even put it right under there and then we're going to drag the liner all the way across and i'm going back and forth several times so the color is poppin and then we're going to take the liner and we're just gonna bring it down a little hello eyes now if you don't look like an alien sex doll you got you some more ok so now that the liner is dying I think I need a little bit of glitter you guys know you don't have to look for this part actually love how this looks but because it's jeffree star we're going to do some more glitter now this is a brand I love makes really don't political the lit cosmetics they specialize in just glitter and the shade is called champagne wishes it is so pretty it's like a champagne nude with rainbow glitter it's really do so i am going to try this glitter glue from to face today I always use my violet boss but I'm gonna cheat on them today and I'm gonna try this one i'm just going to use a phone do me one from morphe this is the g18 and I'm just going to go home and call it a day so this is just for the inner corners to give it that little pretty soft look at some glitter glue on the brush and I'm just going to brush it right where I want the glitter no before that dries you want to get your glider and you guys know I love to just wear this on the cap so I already have some ready to go easy access and then I'm just going to take the glitter on the brush and just am I put it right over there now you want to make sure they both match so I'm just gonna do a little bit of cleanup and if you get you fall out or sparkle on your face you can brush it off I would leave it in any extra shine I could ever get I'm so down for all right so the glitter is drying on there it will basically be on there until you charmer tomorrow so now that the glitter is done let's get some lashes on for mascara today with my lashes to be really black so i can do some big fall season am

new lash glue I'm really excited why because y'all know my issue with lash glue so I am trying that s quito mosquito mosquito lash glue now I saw a lot of good reviews on this one it's latex-free it does not smell like let's give it a smell it's just very like really neutral like don't really think much about it it's not bad at all and high the packaging is a really cute way easier than that squeeze tube and let's get our lash and let's get to gluing now because my corners tend to come up i'm going to add a little bit extra over there now i'm going to give this a minute to get tacky like 30 seconds give a little wave speed up the process all right now what I'm going to see if his blue down just doing a little walk through double check lashes are fully on a skiddo lash glue thank you

of the lower liquid lipstick and shape Queen supreme so let's get to it it's gonna put the hotter pink shade on that outside of my lid and then we're going to put the baby pink in the center all right now we're just gonna put Queen supreme in the center i'm actually going to use a little I shadow brush to help ombre and blend that out and an easy little solution is to use your middle finger and just kind of blend in any harsh lines and then for a little more definition i like to go in with that hot pink color one more time on that brush just get a little bit of product and then you can kind of adding a little bit more darkness all right the lips are dry now i know i said lips was the last thing and if you saw part 1 of this video on how to get Barbie skin you saw how much highlight I applied like oh they're armed we put a lot on but i'm like i can't leave this video without doing another highlight I'm sorry so we're going to go back in with the nude gold highlighted from burberry

throw a wig all this bald ass hair and i love the peachy coral tones with this like warm neutral eye yes now you didn't have to do a pink lip for this you can do brown lip liner with the new do you can do read any lip honest that would work for this even blue green or yellow so recreate this look if you want give it a whirl it took a little bit of time a lot of patience and a lot of marijuana but we got the right now I have a question for you guys since four twenties approaching should be innate do a Q&A part two is that is the time i mean 420 is approaching so I feel like should we do want to leave a comment down below and let me know if we should do one thank you so much for watching I will see you on the next one hello everyone welcome back to my channel now when i asked you guys what kind of videos you want to see next I got an overwhelming amount of response to do a full drugstore makeup tutorial now I know you shady bitch is that I would never do it but come on if your makeup artist you can make anything work not that drugstore makeup is bad it's just have a lot of tendencies to be more misses than hit from my previous experiences um and now that I make makeup I know formula so this was a really interesting experiment and I just want to make a disclaimer that some of the makeup brushes are from my personal collection from other brands that are not drug store but every makeup products used in this video is drugstore pot so if you want to see how i created all this keep watching and see what happens alright so the first thing I'm going to do is take this lip smackers dr pepper flavor lip balm and I'm my lips now your face primer i was looking through all the aisles and I like el pibe you some of this stuff before i've never used this hydrating face primer before so we're going to try it out I'm not really sure how much you're supposed to use i'm just going to use a nice little bull is very bad fying i will let that dry down for a second it now you guys know the first thing I always do is put on a lot of foundation so I Instagram that i was going to be doing this video and you guys gave me so many options and advice on what to buy and the product that kept standing out was the lower yell and fallible Pro matte foundation everyone is like this is amazing everyone's raving about it so I'm going to go in with shade 102 shell page let's pray to Jesus and matches I'm just going to take this with a real techniques blush this is number three hundred you guys know I love to . it all around my face before I blend it out now I've never used any of these products for so let's see how they work ok I think that let me start bumping this in now using new foundations can break you out it doesn't matter if they are high end or not changing your routine just freaks your skin or in general so I need you guys to all pause this video and say a silent prayer for my face and as always we're going to blend to the neck avoiding all the tattoo foods and you guys know I have to dab that year think that's good enough coverage for me we'll see what happens before i do a lot of powder i'm definitely going to conceal now if you watched my previous videos you guys know I'm really not a fan of concealer but this foundation is just not as heavy as I normally would wear it I'm definitely going to conceal and I got this Maybelline better skin camouflage concealer let's try this out this is shade ivory alright this bunch is damp let's start blending out this sponge is really hard like it's actually taking off my foundation so you see that my foundation is like missing right there ok we're not going to use that let's go back to the brush i'm just going to use the same foundation brush and try to pump out some of this concealer before it's too late ok much better I'm like Jesus now the cool thing about this concealer is it's not making any fine lines like more noticeable it's actually concealing and doing an amazing job come thru concealer now sometimes i do cream contour sometimes they don't we're going we're going to just do patters today now I want a full mass of coverage so I thought loreal infallible Pro matte powder foundation and i'm going to dust this over my entire face come through Matt I'm Matt powder now that doesn't have much color to it which is what I wanted but it does leave a really nice matte finish and this shade was 104 Celyn you know I have a fair pitch now the really wasn't a lot of highlight and contour kit at the drugstore I did find this really joke when from Maybelline it's called the master contour palette just three shades it's contour blush highlight I think that contour color is perfect for my skin tone so we're going to try that today and I also found this big bronzing powder it's from prestige cosmetics so i am going to onto our first i'm going to be using this miss cosmetics brush my fav you contour brush I'm going to dip into the contour and was painted ok ok let's try it out now we're gonna go down here and we're going to carve our face out of stone now for the forehead i'm going to be going in with this estee lauder bronzing brush and we're going to dip into that prestige cosmetics let's see how going to do oh my god this has shimmer to it mother fucker ok so my dumbass didn't realize that that goal being up there as a shimmer let's wipe off the gold bronzing Stardust powder off my forehead ok I think we're getting there i might have a small halo but uh it's ok it's preparing me to go to have it now to soften that we're just going to use the same brush and get back into that powder ok we're we're pretty going toward I'm feeling it all right now contouring the nose a little scary so I'm gonna be using the Oval three brush from artiste how I dip in this once you don't need a ton of product unless you want that all right and i'm going to cap the end of it now for a highlight there is a highlight in here which I'm going to watch it with my finger they had no idea if it's gonna work or not pretty now i'm just going to grab a more p310 fan brush I love this thing have someone there and let's see if I'm going to be going it's subtle it's cute I'm noticing that this actually has a little bit of color with it to add some little shimmer about the Browns i'm about to draw on ok actually pretty cute more layering the more shine i'm seeing on my cheekbones all right for brows today I tried to find something comparable to the honest Ostia shade toe and i found two things this Maybelline brow defined and Phil duo I think will match of course it's hard to tell when you look at a unit carton and you can't swatch it so i got this and then also l'oreal has a ground stylist which had a brow powder in it how powder was hard to find at the drugstore so maybe using this guy obviously I don't need this wax because i have no grau hairs so we're just gonna dip it is powder and try to draw on with this ok now that I got the shape down i'm going to go in with this mac eyebrow angled brush and dip into this lowering l all right I decided on a topi gold glitter soft neutral eye and i am going to be using the lower la palette nude one of the lightest shade is probably my color right there so I'm gonna be using this and I'm gonna use my go-to Mac 252 brush and just apply this over the entire eye area definitely messy a lot of fallout you guys know I did you fall out now this position formula these are all like shimmer shades and this top one is like it's really pretty as like a glitter to it so I'm going to dip into this guy right here and I'm just going to put this right under the brow bone oh let's go in with this L contour brush now I'm assuming this is for the eyes not the cheeks and i'm going to go to this wet and wild palette this is that I'm getting sunburned eyeshadow palette and I'm gonna hit this crease color ok I'm just going to put this in my crease it was dark and i'm going to leave some space below and put gold where there is no color yet so bear with me ok now i'm gonna pop this out and i'm actually gonna do this taupe shade right here and go over that and stop in the line with my Makka 224 brush and drag the shadow down a little bit take this brush again and go back in with the light color and right below the shimmers going to blend this out a little bit there we go now i'm going to go in with this one second Toby shimmery color and add in a little bit more dimension to my lid before i do anything with the under i'm going to add some shimmer and i found this press glitter pigment from wet n wild gonna use my finger I know that sounds very strange coming from me but sometimes the fingers are the best good morning goal thank you for joining my lid really pretty now that sounds like a sticky consistency to it which is making it stick to my lid really good all right now I'm going to take a more p 5 11 brush and really get in the inner corner which I could not do with my fingers and then i'm going to go back over with this and really press it yes now i'm going to take some of this and just put it in my inner corner below now for under the eye I'm going to take this myth cosmetics - 20 brush and I'm just gonna take this color here just love it on dirt now I wanted to try some sort of eyeliner so I got this revlon eye pencil and i'm going to put it in my waterline and see what happens all right now with the morphe 514 brush I'm going to go back in with that same brown shade that we just did under the eye and I'm just going to bump it out starting the center of my eye and go outwards and smoke it out a little bit more all right now i'm going to go back in with this shade a little bit on the outside and blend it with my Mac blending brush and kind of merge these two together now to me these eyeshadows blend a little patchy it's old it's kind of frustrating having to go back and forth so many times which is not normal for me but i think i got the eyes where I want them I was talking to my grandma about doing this video and she goes if you don't use the famous pink Maybelline mascara I'm going to slap you upside your head if you've never heard of this mascara you must be under an igloo in Antarctica because this has been around before any of us were born right for lashes i know this is a drugstore makeup tutorial but i got these at the costume store and they were 89 cents so I definitely think this will qualify now these are really big and dramatic not that you're shocked at all it's gonna float away too quick of Jesus now i'm going with the tweezers and I'm trusting my real lashes with the false ones all right second latches on last but not least is the lips now that was a hard one for me I just want something really bright coralie and fun so I found this Revlon brand it is a liquid to matte but it's not long-lasting like mine so this shade is called temptation forces Wow look like a cake candle now it's still wet looking looks like a lip gloss but it says it is ultra HD matte lip color so let's give this a second and see if it is going to dry down all right so it's been about five minutes off camera and this still hasn't dried down I don't know if it's supposed to drive all the way matt it says Matt and Matt Matt as you can see it looks like a lip gloss to me it's like slowly getting there but it's still really shiny I love the lip color I don't mind a gloss it's just not doing what it says so now last but not least I was like oh my God if I can't use my Urban Decay all nighter what the fuck am I gonna do and i found this Maybelline it's basically like a fixed plus but it's called master fix so let's see what happened ok let that settle alright guys that was that full drug store look as you can see some of the products were really amazing i kind of want to scrape office gold glitter and register as the video progressed the foundation did not sit on my skin how I wanted to I maybe it was the primer maybe I don't know no one knows but um I love the look I think it's really fun it was a little challenging for me in the sense that i have never used these products before not that I was afraid she's drugstore makeup but I just prefer higher-end products because the formulas tend to be top notch where some of the stuff i was really hard to do so i hope you enjoy watching this and i'll see you next time bye guys what's up guys welcome to my Channel today we're going to be doing a really dark dramatic sultry look with metallic glow and sneak peek at a new product so have fun watching this and get ready for

be using this occ color pencil in shade enemy today and see what happens this is a cunty eyebrow you're adding a little bit of gel around powder over the browse all right we are good now we want to

my last video do not blow on your brushes if you're doing anyone elses makeup you see you have a client and they see blowing on the bad news once this black is kind of laid down here i'm going to take this mac 224 brush and just start to blend a black up a little bit into that orange color time to do the under eyes are under my eyes we're going to darken them really black now to do that I'm gonna use my favorite MAC eyeliner and this is called smolder and we're just going to lightly pull this down and put some liner in the water line i'm going to drag this liner a little below the lash line so i can smoke it out and use it as my second blending tool now this is not have to be perfect because we're gonna probably put more liner later after we put the shadow down there and blend it out all right the foundation of our liner down now we're going to start smoking and sucking it out now i'm going to use the same black shadow as before but I'm also going to be dipping in some brown colors might be using some honest are seeing shadows for the bottom well we're going to stick with the kat von d left shade but i like to do is I'll dip my brush into the black shadow so it's already loaded

your eyes on the road smokey to buff out the under eye and help it look really flawless i'm going to be using the tiny more p 5 13 brush I love this . perfect for detail and i'm just going to take

I'm doing a little fun warm tone sunset it's not smoky it's not a wing it's like an in-between smoky wing so saddle up get your brush is ready and enjoy this look today I did my normal face routine if you want to see how I did the base of the brows you can look through my channel and find that gym but today we're going to do a cat eye I'm gonna start by priming my lids oh my god Geoffrey finding the lid I know it happens once in a while especially for these extreme glamour looks and I'm gonna go in with the YSL couture I primer i love this one if you want to use the Mac painterly that everyone else uses please use that i personally can't buy mine so we will be using this today and i'm just applying this with a little mac 217 brush and I'm just going to coat my entire lids and I'm gonna bring it up almost to the brow bone drive and have a brow bone if you don't have a brownie i guess if you my whole forehead is the brow bone it's almost like matched my skin tone that's crazy and then I'm going to put some under my eyes - just a little bit just a little hair all right now today we're going to do something that I normally don't do we're going to use the scotch tape for that wing when you do a lot of eyeshadows anyone to get that extreme cut look scotch tape is the easiest way to go now a lot of you're going to like what i mean about that over your foundation I definitely a.m. I'm just going to put on a really light and soft so it doesn't really disrupt it and if it rips it off will just apply more later so what you want to do is just for your tear ducts are you want to follow your natural eye line and just go up so I'm just gonna follow that natural line and being on she scotch probably the most common question is well how do you get this side to match its honestly like drawing on the Browse you just got to eyeball it all right now that the eyes are taped it's time to do the eye shadow now i'm going to use a new palette today that I've never tried this is the new violet Baz Holy Grail I shadow palette now when I saw these colors i was like who bitch this paula is sickening I am loving these read that goal off I think right away i am going to dip into this color called hashed ad and i'm going to be using my Mac 224 brush is going to be like my transition color and let's see how well the shadows blend I'm just gonna go right in my crease I'm actually not going to go all the way you guys know I love to go all the way to my brow bone into the nose today we're going to stop that because I we're doing something do for it sorry dick in my throat and i'm just going to follow my natural brow bone all right now I'm going to take the brush and go all the way to where that tape is and then brush out now course foremost to be they do not have a face tattoo you you can drag it out even more if you want I'm just going to go past the brow for like a really dramatic effect all right now normally i do a really light eyeshadow at the top which i'm going to just do now and i'm going to take the shade called thanks a latte which is a really nice cream nude color without shimmer and i'm just going to take my mac to buy to brush and just take it from the start of the brow and buff it all the way across this is really going to help me get that amazing soft finish and make sure it's all blended and then I'm just going back with that brush with no extra product from the softening that transition color even more now let's add in some darkness all right i'm gonna take this mac 217 brush and I'm going to dip into that wine color oh so pretty high i'm going to create some really dramatic depth so let me just take this brush and I'm going to actually put it on my lid but not all the way just a little bit well halfway there notice how I'm not going all the way in I'm just keeping it what what is this like a sixty percent and then we're going to drag this as well and the throw that tape really comes in handy because it's going to stop all that crazy fall out and it's going to create a beautiful line now how we're going to make this color blend amazing we're going to go back in with that same blending brush from earlier I like to go back and forth and back and forth a lot so we're going to get tipped back into hash tag and then we're just going to blend and blend before I add in any more darkness I want to do a pop of color in here and I keep staring at this color called toffee it's like this gold color I'm like mesmerized by it so let me dip in with my little mac - 13 brush let's see here who what she's a she's pigmented all right so let me just do a little bit in case it's really intense and we'll just pop this right in here come thru gold and i'm going to just take this down right in the corner ok this gold I'm like I can't stop staring at it so ready we got the gold going to the cranberry into the transition I definitely want to do a little bit of a kind of Darkness not necessarily liner but I want that crazy liner fact so I'm gonna be dipping into teddy bear yes and we're using the more feet I 14 crash i'm just going to take this and go really low almost yeah well my lash line is and kind of go a little tiny bit in the crease with that dark color just so i have some like real depth to this look so I'm not taking it in there it's just really subtle settle settle settle there's nothing subtle about this look but I this is a subtle part let me feel this tape off and see what's under this mess my whole skin like pills off who lowered guide me through this misery Bay on mmm now is the side going to be even though oh my god of here BAM she is kunchi ok now that the tape is off I see everybody always taking black liquid or a black liner and doing it across the lid and up I want to be different and not do that because this the shadows are so pretty it's like a beautiful like sunset I'm like zoo on the shadows together are perfect so let's just focus on the bottom now i'm just going to take my black mac smolder eye pencil and we're just going to tightline that water line really thinly all right now for under the eyes i'm going to take this color called so jelly it's like how do you explain this color it's so pretty like a peachy soft coralie I don't know what it's like I don't have to explain it it's just first so I'm taking my Tom Ford 14 pencil brush and I'm just gonna pop some of this down below that liner oh yes when your upper shadow is so intense you don't really need to like do crazy crazy under here we're just going to have the lens this into the gold ok now I brought this almost like the middle of my iris so now i'm going to be taking this color called cranberry splash right here with the same brush and I'm just going to dip into their really lightly now I'm going to take that and drag it under and normally you guys know I love to drag my liner on the bottom out we're actually going to keep it tight today and notice how that black liner on top I've sort of mixed it now that we've gotten towards the end of the eyeball and I'm taking the black and I'm just kind of dragging it down almost like little downward motions so it creates a really nice smoky effect I want to keep that darkness towards the end of my eye and now i'm just going back and forth and back and forth if an eyeshadow is extreme with the pigment and you want to just test it out I'll dab it into the pan and then I'll really lightly go over until I really know densified it can get then I'll go over it more harder meaning my pressure so the first time I was barely dragging it across now I'm like really pushing it into my eyes so I can get that cranberry effect this is Jorge's now usually smoke it out really happy and bring it down i'm going to keep it a little more light today and i'm going to be dipping and to that so jelly color one more time with a little small morphe brush and I'm just going to go over it one more time there we go we're just going to merge these two together so they're like becoming best friends again and then I'm gonna dip in a cranberry splash one more time with the same brush and then just kind of blend them together all right i am obsessed with this I look but it wouldn't be complete without some amazing lashes so let's put them on and I'm going to curl my lashes with the Too Faced better than sex mascara before I put on them lashes bottom master is so essential for this look like bring it all together for lashes today i'm gonna be using the violet boss faux mink style lashes these are brand new and the style is called justice land i love these because they don't like however your eyeshadow and go like all the way up to your brow which I like doing that every day but I want my eyeshadow to have the center stage so let's put these muthafuckas on you know what's cool about these lashes is that when I put the band on my eyelid it like really formed to it easy it wasn't like I had to pull and tug it around for like an hour fit nice i am loving these lashes what do you guys think ok the eyes are officially done I think it's time for some highlight and some lips I'm actually gonna use some blush today huh i'm going to use this NARS beautiful little kabuki brush so soft and i'm gonna be using the NARS blush and shade deep throat now this one has a little fine mike is a glitter in it mmm i love to put blush just on the apples of my cheeks I hate when people take it and they go all the way to the hairline and his mask that beautiful contour that you already did earlier so we're just going to add in just the little bit of color I'm feeling feisty today all right today I'm gonna actually shocked you all and do a really soft highlight these new hourglass highlighters are so pretty this is that your Justin strobe light let's see how they look they're really pretty have a little faith shimmer in it will faint shimmers and i'm just going to apply this right about that blush since the eyes are so extreme I don't want to really blow too much but I guess that's the effect i wanted if you want to do a crazier glow please you know i'm all about that but today I'm gonna let my eyes just have a moment because they're feeling a little neglected now i'm going to take this and just doing here we'll keep it about moment go down that knows a little bit and then go back one more time with the cheek or lips today i'm going to create a little kind of ombre like would look effect with to kat von d liquid lip shades noble and love sick i'm going to be taking this shade on the outsides fuckin mess alive a girl and we're going to leave the middle a little blank all right now that those are connected i'm going to take no bowl and put her right in the center hmm Oh as and I'm gonna take my finger actually in just fine in I love these two together so pretty without the center I'm just adding a little more and blending it I'm gonna go back in with lipstick one more time and just darken a little on the outsides using a different clean finger and voila the lips are done all right now I sadly run out of my Urban Decay static spray so I'm gonna go red 2 so 4 i'd buy like 20 of them so I'm

color correcting eyeshadow primer these are really good for travel on the go just a little pencil you just coat your lids with these and drag up and out so I'm just going to take my little mac 25 to brush you guys know I cannot live without this I use it every single day and I'm just gonna blend that all over my lid and then drag it a little upwards now as usual I've done my highlight contour and foundation including browse if you want to see how I did that just go through my channel and find the official face routine video so the star of this whole video is the new two-faced sweet peach

don't even know what i'm going to do today but I guess we're going to find out together so i think just to start off the look we're going to go in with the white peach it's the shay right there and i'm just going to take that same brush dab it in and coat my entire lid and i think i'm going to do some glitter today I got a lot of glitter just laying around my office so I'm like I just need to coat my entire existence and glitter and you guys know I love to take the shadows and put them right under the brow bone and drag it all the way down so now that my base is down i'm going to go in with a mac 224 brush and I'm just going to pick a transition color to build off up there is so many pretty colors in this 1i just like oh wait what do we do first this one is called puree looks so pretty so let's dip into her and see what happens this is just more so for blending out later i'm just gonna tuck that in my crease my love it's like a really warm toned so normally you guys know I like to take my shadows all the way down i am going to not do that today and just try something a little different if you want to fast-track and blend this out you can go in with your white peach color again and just buff it out really soft and then I like to go back and forth back and forth after lack a southern page just blend and blend in and Mike race let's sell <day> fifteenth </day> so transition color is done i think i want to add a little bit of the summer young called early so we just did parade the crease now we got some were young then i'm going to dip into this one called tempting i'm kinda going to blend that in there as well make it a little dark I love this mac 217 it's perfect for like getting in there so let's dab in some summary yum i love the names for the shadows there are cute it was going to tuck that in there a little bit is for some added definition it's really not going to be that big of a difference it's a little more darker so I'm just adding in depth right now and then we're going to take tempting right after that little darker we're just gonna tuck that in our crease I'm not gonna drag my black all the way down like I normally do you want to stop it and just kind of drag it away and then go back in with the blending brush dab a little bit of parade in there and go over it so it's all about the back and forth back and forth with this look you really want this to look blend it out excuse me lowered a southern lady just not Bart Black that all right now I'm just going to go straight for highlight and glitter for this I look already there's this color called luscious I'm like whoo so this one right here is let's just now when i first looked today I was like okay this is q i swatched it on my finger and I was like during this sure looks good so I'm just going to take this little flat brush this is from morphe there's no number I've had this for like a really long time so surrender the number but I know they must still have this and why pigment I'm just going to highlight under my brow a little bit hello my browser like thank you Jesus you always forget us it's a different look and there you guys are probably what you're like really going on with the highlight and there's something really soft and delicate because they have to draw my eyebrows I can't just wipe off powder if it gets my brown hair i got to be really careful so you regular folks have it easy now I'm going to take the same brush same luscious color and i'm just going to pop it in my inner corner right now well because i just want to see how it's going to look shimmery and i'm also going to put it a little under my eye here all right now before we do the under eye and let's put on 15 layers of glitter i'm gonna be using this violence boss amazing as it is just amazing this is called copper Ella it is perfect for this look and they actually have glitter like adhesive already it's called their secret weapon glitter adhesive so let's use that I am too faced has glitter glue as well but this one is like quick and easy like my all Max's fuck boys and we're just going to coach this whole made and we're going to go under that darkness that I created earlier and everything that i'm coding will have glitter on it now if you don't want glitter just skip this part if you're watching my channel and you don't want glitter and no one's okay so oh my glitter is poured it all over my crotch so I just like to take them out and put it on the cap and i think i'm going to take a little brush this is like an old Mac brush i have and we're just gonna ah we're going to come because gosh jarred that she was good let it and we're just going to coat everywhere that glue was and i'm going to be really delicate i hate when glitter gets everywhere so you just gotta pass this on now there's going to be a little fall out some sparkles on my face we'll deal with that later for now I just want to make sure my eyelids look like copper the last oh this letter is the glitter is basically done for now if you want you can put glitter and down here i'm going to leave it kind of like more fresh uplifting i noticed a lot of the times that always do dark under my eyes look at me glitter everywhere hi middle of rubbing all over me sometimes it's just like one of those things I'm like huh don't go to waste hike later oh my god it's all over my labia minora alright so for under the eyes what are we gonna do i think i'm gonna do there's so many options I'm going to do black liner not that any of your shock but i'm not going to smudge it out really crazy this is smouldered from Mac you know that's my favorite and we're just going to do it really tight on the water lines so we're not going to drag it down and do a really dramatic like I normally do it's just literally going to be that that's it all right so we got the liner on in there now we are going to smoke it out a little bit i'm going to keep with that round family at the bottom and just use these two again and then we're going to go in with Just Peachy it's like this amazing peachy coral i mean it's it's a peach coral color and I'm going to blend that in my inner corners and then we're going to smoke it out a little more so let's use this more fee for 33 brush and dip into that peach color I'm just going to put it over luscious so it's almost like I'm layering oh wow pretty I was going to layer this a few times now being really delicate and I'm just kind of pressing it into my skin I'm not going back and forth all crazy now i'm going to go in with this top four pencil brush and I'm just going to play around with that puree and so yummy one more time and then there's one of the top here called charmed I'm sure I'm going to dip into that one as well I'm going to pray and summer yum and the same time so many different here and then different here so it kind of makes its own color and then I'm just going to go under that I and just kind of stuff out I'm only doing you know half my lids like from the iris out blend then I'm going to take this morphy 514 brush and I'm just going to dip into that charmed I'm sure it's like a topi darker brown and we're just going to lightly buff that under bring it out just create a little more depth to that under I then that blending brush we used earlier same thing i'm going to go in with that same charm color and we're just gonna pop it and blend it out out all right now before we do lashes and mascara i'm going to take this color called nectar it's like a gold in let her know it's golden yumminess and I'm going to dip into that with that same morphe brush and I'm gonna do it at the inner inner corner so it's like that extra little pop if I turn to the side you can definitely see that this is a two-faced palette tutorial it only makes sense that I used that better than sex to face mascara i love this one I know they have a new waterproof one that I have not tried yet it comes in the mail in a few days so if you've tried the waterproof one tell me maybe in the comments what you guys think of it because i cannot wait to try it this is like one of my favorite mascara is not the only issue I have with it is what I do my bottom lashes if i look down for a period of time it kind of creates those black dots so when I heard that the waterproof version was coming I likes grange so hopefully that will alleviate that issue because who was that alright so after I do this bottom mascara i'm going to show you guys a little trick that I like to do first we're gonna hold our breath because this brush is so big sometimes if i'm not paying attention i hit the bristles on my eye and then you guys know it's all downhill from there so take a deep breath make the weirdest face that you can and go for it alright so if you ever look down and get those black mascara . that i was talking about earlier a lot of the times i find it really easy to take a like dr beauty blender and any like setting powder that's translucent so like this cat cosmetics one is great I just dab a little bit of it on the end and then i'll take it and all go where the lashes are and I'll just kind of dust translucent powder on the ends so I do not get those mascara marks and for the most part it usually works unless you live in like Florida or Africa or the humidity is really insane this should definitely work for you now for lashes going to go and JD's are really pretty these are the faux mink ones from sephora you guys have seen us do this a million times think these are cute they're subtle ish settle for me but I think they're gonna still let that glitter show and have at the moment so let me precut these and measure my eye off camera and i will be right back all right so I just trim these i'm going to put my glue on high glue if you guys know any lash glue that is non latex and doesn't smell like old people to China of bingo game please leave some comments below I need an amazing latch company that the google actually like hold my inner corners because they always have the issue where 10 minutes later the corners up and I'm like I'm gonna kill / so please help your bitch out now you guys know I like to just place these in the little of my lid and then I'll take tweezers and just kind of mold them around where I want to go just kind of hold them down like don't move or I'll cut you anyone

with the little bobby brown eyeshadow brush just start placing this on the lid now what I love to do is take the mac fix+ this is the coconut flavor and spray the brush a little bit for that full metallic moment and then once you go on the lid haha hi there we go so I'm just going to take this and start buffing it on the entire lid all right now I definitely need to add some depth and dimension into my crease so I'm just going to be going in with this guy and see how that looks at first now the shadows are very pigmented so you definitely want to knock out your fall out BAM this is a matte shadow so I'm just gonna tuck this in my crease right above that copper shimmer just my lids really dark and dramatic all right now we're basically merging the two shadows with this together and we're just going to take it down here here I don't really want it on my lid so I'm just gonna be really gentle and then you can take your blending brush and go back in with that orange color and just kind of go over that darkness again so it blends out nicely now i'm going to start on my under eyes now for the inner rim month i'm going to be using the anastacio pro pencil I love this it's not start white like I normally do it's more than nude color and i'm just going to take my Beauty Blender as always to get into that water line so my elasticity of my eyes does not fall apart it settle it's not too crazy but it definitely opens and lifts the eye ok now that the water line is done i'm going to softly add some shading under it going to take this mac 239 brush and I'm going to dip lightly into that transition color that we used earlier which is this guy and I want to actually mix it with this other bronzy color so it's creating its own color on a lightly just go under where it just to the liner now you can actually skip this part and just do mascara if you're not feeling as dramatic but if you don't like drama why the fuck are we even watching this together it's going to take it and go all the way always going to go all the way we're going to basically connect this inner part with the below there we go and I'm just laughing about being really soft motions now with the same brush I'm going to take a darker color dip into this guy right here and I'm just going to lightly buff it under my eyes in between that light and what I just laid down so it's almost like a second liner I'm just going to do it really like the middle now i'm going to take my blending brush from earlier and without any new product on it i'm just going to blend it out a little softer now i'm going to highlight the eyes and i'm going to take the same back to buy to brush and I'm actually going to dip into this metallic shimmer up here hello metallic now I'm just going to take it under my brow bone and just about fit on a little bit just have a little bit more depth and shine and glow now because the lids are really dark I want to brighten them up a little bit add some more

just going to coat my entire top and bottom lashes with this I love this mascara separates the bottom lash and very all right now I'm going to take my trusty duo lash glue as the glue is getting tachy I like to really thank the band so it will form to your eyelid better you never wanted to just be straight out comes out of that box you want that slight curve now I always apply these with tweezers it's a lot easier for me of course if you don't like tweezers you do you and I like to just place them in the center of my lid and while the glue is still tacky and drawing down you want to move them around to the desire to the location and if the corners are ever giving you trouble this hold them down and press in all right now that the latches are on i am looking at my I look and I think I want a little bit more shimmer in my inner corner I'm just going to take the same stealing stuff with a brush already use for under my eye and I'm just going to lightly padded and tiny little inner corner

warm tones I used for the eyes and no i don't normally do that since i had a cool undertone but i love it i think i'm definitely going to be playing with more color and trying things out of my comfort zone I'm going to be trying a lot of new things coming up so if you have any suggestions on any looks you want to see leave some feedback below and I will see you on the next one bye guys what's up everyone welcome back now I know it's been a second since I've done a full makeup tutorial so today I thought listen um it's time today's like i'm going to give you some dramatic winged liner I was looking through my videos and I'm like damn I haven't done a link in a minute so here's a way i will be doing plenty of them for you guys so if you want to know how to create this look keep on watching all right let's get started today i'm going to be using a new kat von d beauty product this is the locket color correcting eyeshadow primer I got the lightest shade for me now these are supposed to primary lid and also color correct in case you have any dark circles so I'm just gonna take a little bit of this and it's now I'm just going to take a little brush with no product and just drag that around so we make sure it's evenly all right now the star of today's look is Pam the many mua makeup geek collaboration palette I am obsessive about hi when I first saw it the red one Mars immediately was like oh my god red eyeshadow i'm going to start off this look by using some of the light shades for blending purposes for my transition color to start i'm gonna be using the soul Mac 224 brush is my favorite you guys know and i'm going to be dipping into rat pee and Sora and we're just going to mix these two together and I'm just going to put this right in my socket and blend blend blend now we are going to do a really dramatic wing today so i'm going to do really dramatic eye shadow I mean it goes hand in hand right before i get ready for these lashes I've been in Hawaii for a week I were fake lashes every day so my real lashes are pretty janky right now I think I totally need to take a break on wearing makeup but that's like removing my arms and legs so hopefully my lashes will get over it and not hate me too much now the cool thing about these shadows as they are really pigmented and they blend quick so you don't have to spend a lot of time blending it kind of does the job for you all right now I'm going to take this mac 217 brush and I'm going to dip right into Mars now I pigment this is like a deep red i love Reds every time I see a red I'm just like a home I'm gonna take this and remember we are going to do a really drastic Blackwing so I'm going to take this red I'm just gonna start putting it in the crease and a little lower on my lid well so we can really smoke it out and get that rusty dramatic effect and I'm going to take it and go all the way to the lash line just not all over here we're just going to stick it to most you know the corners and i'm going to go back in with that same brush and dip interviewees just like and soften the line and blend up now oh my god I felt like Jesus just part of the Red Sea because I'm obsessed with this look already ok so now when I saw Luna this metallic foil one right here I was like oh so i am going to wet brush you can use any synthetic little brush you want and i am going to dip into that one oh my god listen here it's not even out my skin yeah and i'm like oh and i'm going to take this and drag it all the way to the inner corner and half white hand so it's like really blended now you guys know I like to pack on those metallic so I could have stopped but you know I have an issue with that so I'm just going to keep on packing it and I'm gonna also drag it a little bit down here because you know we are going to do that bottom shadow eventually someone's going to start now and then of course to blend you want to take Mars one more time and just kind of Pat and blend in that shimmer so I just flows nicely together and notice how I'm just connecting and popping that color right there course if you want your red back one more time we're going to go in there and just kind of Pat it in it should create a little blend in fact what i like to call it ok now you can save the bottom shadow or later I like to just do it now before the wing okay before we add any more shadow let's get to cutting that fear swing all right to get that crazy bitch I'm gonna kill you winged liner i like to use two products swarms over I like to use two products and that is the YSL babydoll liner and then to fill in i'm going to be using my chart black clay liner I love this stuff this is like water proof that does not move but to begin let's get the blackout now I love this because you that see that bristle so then and it just really helps you create your shape so let's start now I like to start from the middle and just create a shape of what i want and i just kinda start carving it out now i do want to follow my lash line and create a natural you know going to get up angle and that's where my wings going to start does that look beautiful right now he'll know it looks like shit but it got it has to start somewhere so as the liner is drying i'm going to take some in just your drag it up oh now you definitely have a steady hand so if you drink into new york red bulls or you're at all hasn't kicked in yet just you know wait it out we're all because you really got to focus on this part a lot of back and forth I get asked all the time what's a quick trip no trick for a wing and I'm like there really isn't one I like to really get up close to let me just use this palette has helped some golden wings take time so do not rush this debt or you're gonna regret it ok so let's put that back for a second and now we're going to go in with our liner and you can use any little liner brush you have this is sonia one from target i love sharp that is mmm and I just like to dip in the pot hi I've missed a million times and then product dries fairly quickly so you just wanna get it on that damn and blend now why didn't I just use the liquid because this will really make sure it stays all day I'm days there we go gradually adding and plotted from dragging up all right now I'm just gonna clean up the edges bring it out even more mmm there we go are right now that the wing is done before we do lashes i am going to do a little bit of light smoky on the bottom so that all right now for a liner I wanted to do like a weird burgundy purpley kinda look now I know some people don't like that they think it makes them look - like drugged out but the first shadow ever wore was a rusty red and put it in my waterline and I think everyone thought I was on heroin or something but i'm having a little flashback friday so i'm going to be using the rihanna Mac Talk That Talk lip pencil for my eye hopefully I'll go blind and if i do is the last time you'll ever see all right so you know what you know what it is we're gonna use a Beauty Blender and pull the i get in the way this looks cool actually i like I'm feeling this and beyond easy of course I'm gonna bust out some of that with eyeshadow so we are definitely not done all right now I'm going to take a little Tom Ford pencil brush and I'm going to dip into Mars BAM and then I want to do a little bit of insomnia it's like such a pretty like duochrome metal I gotta try it so first we're going to take a little pencil brush and we're gonna lightly just dragged under the liner oh now you can obviously skip doing liner you can do black liner you can do brown you can do anything you want so don't feel like you have to do a red with this look I'm just being a little you know have a little artsy bulb it here but i always do black and my waterline so I definitely want to change it up today and I'm just gonna budge and drag and i'm actually going to take that and put it under the wing just the hair okay so we got the red down now I want to dip into insomnia a little bit like I feel like I got two swatches with my finger so you guys could really see it at first oh my god it's like up around the ring metallic heaven I'm like I'm just gonna put some right just like an smoke up my bottom me that Warren ok over the burgundy the red I'm like I'm just taking a brush with no product and just kind of merging everything together so it's like a flawless blend all right now it's time for lashes I have been obsessed with these the vegas nail lashes you can give you is also i'm obsessed they called brand glamour and high

so if you love it give it a thumbs up or if it makes me throw up to skip to the next one but thank you guys as always for watching and I'll see you next time what's up everyone welcome to my channel if you're new hi how are you my name is Jeffrey I'm just a sweet country christian gal with the dream and here we are and i just can't believe that gets a good makeup everyday ok but for real hi guys i missed you so I've had a really crazy month there has been so much going on besides traveling a lot i recently got in that crazy car accident thank God for geico full coverage because i was able to get the full entire cost of my car it was a total loss and it was all paid for thank you Jesus so you know i'm not i just can't believe that I'm even here and I'm even able to you know have a brand and have a successful business so I'm like you know what I literally you know not to be morbid but I could have died a few weeks ago so I was like having a realization like you know what if I can you know by things that I've always dreamed of buying why am I being apprehensive about it i literally have one life and it's so short on this earth I was like you know what I'm buying something I've wanted since I was 12 so after I got my settlement check I walked into that Lamborghini dealership and i said hi my name is Miss Starr and I was like one so I can't believe that you guys but I bought a Lamborghini her con it is the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen though my hobbies and things that I love your makeup cars and talk so I just want to say one thing you know it's not about materialistic items it's about your goals that you set for yourself and one of my goals was to have a lambo and have a business no it's not about the cars and jewelry and all that bullshit because when you're on your deathbed that shit is not going to matter but it was a moment for me because I never would have dreamed of having that ever in my driveway so you know it's crazy but i just want to say that anyone can do it look at me i am just one guy and makeup that started out with just hopes and dreams and i did not fit in high school no one really believed in me and if I can do it you definitely can so not to sound like a motivational speaker but honestly go after your dreams stop living for everyone else i see so many people that just stop what they're doing because other people are judging them or they think that they're not going to fit in stop it do you so besides that I had a little like moment like i got home everything was amazing i was sharing my story with everybody online and then that night some crazy bitches decided to all gang up and flag my Instagram brand account not my personal but they flagged my cosmetics instagram i'm like who has time for that so basically algorithm if you don't know what that means it's like the system of Instagram so if a bunch of people are attacking you and saying you're doing something or flagging you Instagram will deactivate you to review you now I don't know why they don't have a special wing for this yet but all we've got my page was gone so a lot of people are like did you block me and I'm like girl so thank God for Instagram reaching up to me and monday morning while we are back the page is all good but I'm just like two people really have that much time on their hands like you're worried about my page on my girl go outside and get some like a deep gulp of air and just go to you so if anyone else deals with any negativity whether it's at work or at school or anywhere else it's like you know I guess that a lot how do you deal with negativity you just have to let it roll off your back I'm like he will not stop me I'm so motivated actually after that happened I'm like I'm more motivated than ever to just fillet so I'm excited to have you back you guys so what are we doing today we are using the gnu honest Ostia Beverly Hills modern renaissance eyeshadow palette we're going to dip into this

get over the fact that like my birthday Thanksgiving it's over like December is here and i honestly can't believe it so I thought it'd be fun to do something a little different let's tone down the craziness for the week and just do something that's just really like soft and gentle you know and sometimes really quick so this is a quick easy holiday look the I look is so minimal but I'm loving it i'm looking at the monitor like oh my god actually cannot believe that I like myself with this amount of makeup on usually y'all know I'd wear 20 more palettes and 10 more highlighters but I'm like you know what let's just scale it down and do something that everyone could easily recreate so today we're going to be diving into this little craziness so if you want to see how I got all this together and keep on watching alright so i'm going to use a new primer today I'm like okay we got so many products and that's just didn't even happen this year I am overwhelmed but the brand burberry which hi love their clothing but they also have a beauty line which is very underrated and I've used highlighters a lot but they have this new holiday primer now this is called the fresh glow luminous fluid base on my girl that comes in this beautiful gorgeous gold packaging with their famous plaid and this is a makeup primer and it comes in a little bottle like this and now I used it once when I went out the other day and I like the lot so I think we're gonna give her a little spin today and see how it looks on camera so let's just rub this all over and see what happens oh it does have like a little bit of like with shimmer in it fire so we're gonna make sure this is all settled in now for foundation today this look is very easy like especially for me sometimes I go really in this is going to be a release just soft pretty moment today so for foundation I don't want anything like to too cakey I know that's kind of shocking to everybody but I think i'm just going to go in with i keep using this you guys the lemare soft fluid it is so pretty I just I can't stop using it so we're just gonna give her a few pumps now this one is kind of meeting the full coverage but it just looks really real so if you're someone that wants a lot of coverage but you're like girl its way to take you for me I think this is going to be perfect for you and of course I'm gonna dock this all over and what do we do next we're gonna buff and bounce all right now this skin is already feeling snatch that primer made this foundation even better I feel like I'm looking in the mirror like oh ok very skin-like ok now moving on concealer gonna be going with my heart shape and tape which I love this is one of my favorites and i'm just going to dot it all around the under eyes today now with the RT soval seven brush we are going to blend alright this concealer is blended out like now quickly before the under eyes try to play me we're gonna take some Chanel setting powder and we're just going to Pat that under our eyes someones dropped everywhere so we're just going to take this now I like to take the little sponge in here of course if you want to use a brush you definitely can and i'm just going to Pat this under my eyes and let it show in front if this is going to make sure that are under eyes do not crease and it almost makes your pores kind of like disappear so we're going to take that on our chin as well and then got a little bit on the nose besides that what else do we need to do we're not even done setting the under eyes so y'all need to just have a speed we're gonna take the of course Mac shivering white studio fix and with a little JT wait Lexie brush we're gonna and we're gonna extra set the under eye and I was taking this and i'm not just kind of like swiping around i'm actually like packing it into the skin which is something I've been doing for a long time it just makes the foundation last longer throughout the day and make sure that it doesn't move around all right we are set and blended this is the 186 brush it's an old-school max brush and it's perfect for packing on foundation powders so we're going to take another color of studio fix this is NW 18 and we're going to a lot of bottoms off we're going to pack that into the skin avoiding where we really highlighted of course and we're going to do the entire neck hi grandma was dirty girl and once again you guys can see I'm like packing this into the skin and not just like we am I going in now time to contour now for contour today we're gonna be using it be a morphine 9c palette this one is really good for everyday use she comes in a variety like this and i love to dip into this guy and this guy just kind of mix and today we're gonna be using a little Chanel powder brush bambam now i'm going to go a little lower than I normally do and we're just gonna sculpt this face really really sharp today like we have any issues today you wanna go in the parking lot the moment and now i'm gonna go with a little more p III and I like to go to this top shade i'm gonna bring this up into the hairline just gonna sculpt around my face and get that really bronzy pretty look going all right now it's really snatched that forehead i'm adding in a lot today because we're really going to focus on skin contour and highlight I'm using this makeup forever brush because it just get a big area really quickly and it just blends nicely so I'm gonna go a little darker than usual on the forehead if you're afraid of that you do not have to do with this dark but I could play around sometimes you don't always have to do your same routine switch it up feeling wrongs now i'm definitely going to do the nose quickly now when I mean by that is I like to take this and I like to press my hands like this so we make it even more and then I'm gonna barely touch the pan ok now we're just going to go right down so if you want to contour your nose in a flash and really quickly just go down and go to town girl right now we're going to take a little more fiji three again and go into that lightest shade i was going to kind of go over the jaw and soften her a little bit so it's not so harsh I'm just trying to have a moment today so where is also going to take that powder again and we're just going to go over the contour on the forehead with it just kind of soften it so it's not too severe gonna go over that knows a bit so we're not like too crazy because it's hard to breathe right now we are contoured now i'm going to quickly do some eyebrows off camera if you want to see how i draw them on i will put a link in the description box down below so back all right now this I like is probably one of the most easiest i have ever done on my channel so we're going to take a little Mac painterly Paint Pot and we're just going to coat our entire lid with that really quickly and just kinda give our eyes second primer and now the foundation and concealer that is on my lids definitely enough but is it now for eyeshadow get ready for this one does it is a really simple I'm gonna pull out my little busy our palate I love with this guy it is it's been through a lot in through some lot of traveling definitely broke this months ago thats hanging on a thread right now people but it's okay because guess what it still works I'm sure you can see right here this is one of my favorite shade it just hit pan the other day and it is the perfect like ivory bone white color to put all over your legs and I like to take this and put it from my brow bone all the way down and it just gives you a really lifted look and this is also going to help that crease color blend effortlessly alright the base is laid down alright so this look is almost done actually no that's kind of shocking so I'm gonna take a little blending brush any blending brush that you want will suffice and I'm gonna pull out the beauty killer palette now the shade Courtney girl this is the tea and the truth so we're just gonna go into her for a second now this is where it gets really easy so the other day when I posted that look I literally just took this brush and I had like 20 minutes to get ready before i went somewhere and I think you know what I'm just gonna be really really soft and pretty today and see what happens which is scary because meet me toning it down takes a lot of me so I took it and I literally went all the way and we're talking just right there so even though like make sure knows thinner by the way it's a little trick I've been doing forever you just gotta flick up and blend this crease color into the white shadow that you just laid down now this is where you can stop it here you can go out more i like to take it and even put it on my lashline and lit a little bit so almost like hugs it i mean if this is not the most simple I've ever done girl get ready and then you're gonna go back in with that shade of one more time and you're just gonna put in a little bit more in to the crease and y la we are like there you could stop here now I always say this if you want to add more you definitely can but if you really want to stop here it's ok but i am going to add in just a little bit of dimension to my lids so I'm gonna go in with shade vanity it is a dark like black and plum color and I'm just going to go into the little detail brush and I'm just going to lightly barely put some into my crease just so my lids have like some extra drama i'm going to go back in with the blending brush and just take it and soften it so there's no extra powder again on any of the brushes we're just gonna really just make the lid have a little oh hi so it's not so flat all right now to make your eyes pop a little bit we're gonna take a little fascinating white liner from Mac where it's going to take that beauty blender have it lightly pull down our water line and then we're gonna pack in that white liner and turn into it all fam ok cool now it's time for a little bit of mascara no shocker here i'm gonna be going with my benefit roller lash and we're going to coat our entire top and bottom lashes and this is really going to make this look pop-and-lock just really allocate and slay all right let's put this on now for blush today i'm going to be using the new nars unfiltered to look at that pink packaging it's like a pink mirrors so pretty and it comes with six shades oh how you see myself What's Up Girl hi yes ok so I'm going with the new morphy y5 brush these are all gold chrome I'm like okay so i'm going to go in with this guy right here what's the name on the back you better look on the bag she's called Fame ok that's cute BAM and we're just going to these are pigmented I should probably chill out i'm just gonna lightly just a little the apples of the cheeks to give my face a little more color and warmth it's nothing too crazy just gives your face a little extra like flavor if you will all right now let's fucking highlight because i forgot i wanted to do blush today beome and now i think for this look I want to stay in like the peaches and the gold realms so i'm probably gonna do something blinding all right now I'm gonna go in with the new mac extra dimension skin finish this is in shade show gold and i'm going to use the new little morphy why 14 brush for highlighting today and we're just going to go in here now I've never used this before using my inner corner highlight but not on the cheek so let's see what happens oh I love that like pink undertone it's pretty this really reminds me of the pink heart shade in the anastacio moonchild locate like we're talking a really similar now this definitely is not blinding enough it looks really pretty but I feel like my face needs a little bit more like like the wow factor so let me just put this on now on top i'm gonna go in with my Mac Daddy artist Couture highlighting powder and this is in shade cocoa bling now this I'm gonna use a little more if you brush of course this is the morphe fan 310 brush and I'm just going to my god this is like this is the blinding effect that I need every single day so let's see what happens we'll see there's a difference I'm sorry what oh my god yeah it just makes your face look like almost like wet-looking which is like em all right now I'm quickly going to do the Cupid's bow like oh hi and then we're going to do the little tip of my nose like this is so pigmented I'm just gonna like kind of massage it in alright there we go i feel a little bit more like myself I'm like maybe doing a home at look I don't know if I can pull it off because i'm fucking so shocked and scared about blowing okay I'm a little bit better now it's time for the lips all right now for lift today I'm going to be going in with my own of a lower liquid lipstick and shade christian-themed this is from the holiday collection and i just love this is really soft and pretty and if you want to do a crazy bold lip or not even a stick and you want the last full day definitely liquid lip so let's go in alright this lipstick is dry i love it so like just soft and like very fun jeffree star like but I'm I'm living for it so besides that I need some mother effing setting spray now I want to keep this look very dewy and very soft so I'm gonna be using my Armani prima setting spray and we're gonna mix it with a little touch of luminous dewy skin missed so let's get our engines ready and on the count of three one two looks fucking set and then we're gonna do some more fluffy alright baby this face is set and this look is complete now toning it down for me is a little hard i don't know if i can turn down any more than this but i'm really liking it I think it's different a softer side of Miss Starr I'm loving it i think this is a really cool for the holidays it's quick and easy kinda like my mom's birth when she had me but thank you guys so much for watching this tutorial i had a lot of fun doing it now I think for the next

holidays like I can't handle it so if you guys want a lot of first impressions let it snow but I'm ma love you guys and i'll see on the next one what's up everyone welcome back to the pink fabulous channel mrs. jeffree star for today's look I wanted to recreate a look I saw a Jaclyn hill film recently she did this beautiful halo smokey eye and when I saw it I was like mesmerized and glued to the screen like it looked perfect on her and I i was inspired i wanted to do my version of course my face shape is a little different than hers so I tailored look to fit my bone structure but trying to stay true to what she did and i love it i think it's really gorgeous it's an everyday look at anyone could wear it's very dramatic but also settle at the same time so it's not too you know it's not - punchy I love watching other youtubers and I love watching what other people are doing because it's so fun to be inspired I normally wouldn't do this look at myself but after watching her as I was like man you know I got to give this a try so i hope i did her look justice if you want to see how i created this and keep watching let's get started now I haven't used my Bobby Brown vitamin face base in a minute this is what i normally use on the daily if you've never tried this get the fuck out of your seat and get in the car and go to support at now Beauty Blender actually just put out a new color this is the nude ache I love this color I love to just take this put it in and you're just going to coat your entire face with this and this is really good for people with normal to dry skin oily I would stay away from this and get something a little more mattifying for foundation I'm going to be using my trusty do your air flash you guys know I can't live without this and i also tried a new cocktail normal and mixes with the Armani but today i'm going to be using that lower mercier silk creme photo finish foundation now I got to shade a little darker than my normal skin tone just like a little more bronzy i'm going to take the air flashes usual now we're going to take this guy and i'm going to be using the artiste old brushes I'm going to probably break the rules and just apply the foundation on the garage and before I brush it i'm going to . it around my entire face now the reason why i like this is it really cuts down the time of blending it's like minimal and you're pretty much done quicker than you've ever gotten ready your whole entire life so let's get to brushing and blending all right now because this foundation is a little bit warmer i am going to do some really light concealer so I'm gonna take that urban decay naked skin it looks really full-coverage i think on camera but it just blends really nice and the cool thing about this product as a little goes a long way so you don't want to overdo it now i'm actually going to take the Beauty Blender and buff this out so let's get to blending all right concealer is blended now before the under eyes want to crease on me I'm going to be setting it with some loose powder and my favorite is the Chanel when I keep going back to it and I love to take it with the damp Beauty Blender and all this literally go like this and dip in and there's some powder on it and I just pressed it under my eyes and blood and tap it in all right under eyes are set now i'm actually going to set my entire face with Studio Fix from mac cosmetics I've been doing that forever and that's just like my go-to secret to keeping on that foundation throughout the whole day so I'm going to take my trusty Tom Ford powder brush we're just going to dip into that studio fix and I'm not going to do the under eye areas but i'm going to go around everything else all right now let's contour the face for contour i'm gonna be using the morphe em five to seven ever since I saw Jacqueline use it I got five of these brushes and can't stop using it so thanks for the tip girl I'm gonna be going in with my trusty Kat Von D shade and light I want to try something new where I don't go as deep into a contour as I normally do why because I'm just trying to stuff so I'm going to start my client or a little normal then I usually do and i'm going to stop right there usually go a lot lower but i want a different type of effect today and that's the cool thing about makeup as you can literally have a different face shapes with look if you want to now we're just gonna carve out this chin and just contour along the hairline all right now i use this more p-47 brush the other day and I really liked it for the nose i blend it out with the Beauty Blender and I just like the effect now the cool thing about this one it really chisels so if you don't want to save your nose contour try something else but this one made my nose really slender honey like she's going at it if you guys randomly hear my dog delicious screaming in the background there's people hanging curtains and doing construction in my house so he's going a little cuckoo all right for brows i'm actually going to draw them on with the new pencil on estas da came out with a new product called the brow definer and i'm going to use shade blonde today this is my first time ever using this so let's see what happens I think I'm a good critique at formula and this one's really great sharp all right now I'm going to finish up the brows with the pro pencil from on estas yet now I love this because it's a nice highlight and i'm just going to put this directly under the brow and i'm going to take a mac 252 brush and just soften that line now let's get started on the eyeshadow for this look I'm going to be using the Anasazi of self-made palette now Jaclyn credible I like with this so I'm going to use the same thing i'm going to be going in first with sherbert being on right there and that's going to be our transition color and I'm gonna be going in with a morphy 441 blending brush and I'm just gonna get in there and pump it out hey there's no big fans are bringing the transition color all the way here just because my face is longer i like to give it that extra and you really want this well blended so spend a lot of time going back and forth and i'm actually going to take that same mac 252 brush and just blend this out a little bit with no product it's the one I used earlier and we're just going to soften and then go back to the other side and repeat all right now let's go in with a mac 217 brush and I'm going to be dipping into this color right here hot chocolate and we're going to start by taking that color and tucking it into the crease here and bringing it down to the lid and I was doing packing motions so we're going to avoid any fallout all right now i'm going to be taking a pencil brush this one is from chanel its number 19 i love this one at the pencil brush but it's still kind of dough me and more thick at the top instead of being really narrow so you can use any pencil brush that you want and we're still going to be using the hot chocolate shade this time I'm just going to be going in side here and this is how we're going to create that halo effect and just pack in that color and then I'm going to take my brush right of the transition color and just soften these edges out a little more now for the middle color this was like my favorite part of Jaclyn's look was that metallic shimmer in the middle i'm going to be taking this mac brush you don't brush you use it so much the number wears off you have to like put it in the light like this is a 230 grow up have this brush for like ten fucking years i'm going to be using the pink champagne color right here now if you wet the brush this shit is like oh it's heaven so we're going to take my fixed plus as usual and we're just gonna and then you're going to go in with that color and just quote your brush with it and just start placing it right on the lid oh my lord oh so pretty i want to die like I don't know if I want to be buried in this color on my funeral and I was going back and forth and packing and I'm bringing it right up to that transition color but not going on top of it so you want to stop it right as you get to that and now that that metallic colors laid down you're going to go back in with your brush to add the hot chocolate you're just going to kind of blend out the edges softly I didn't put any new shadow on this I'm just kind of going back and forth so now for under the brow we're going to be highlighting a little bit i'm going to be using the shade up here called the buttery I'm just going to take this and softly and blend it on top just so it gives it a little more dimension to my love now run to the I'm going to take that illamasqua I painful this is shade valve it's like a screaming flesh Tony white it's not the stark white I normally wear it's a more yellow tone which I love so I'm going to add that in my waterline now you can do any color you want with this brown black whatever i lo lighter tones because it really just opened up her eye and gets you a new look all right now we need to start smoking out the under eyes so let's get started on that smoke out the under eyes I'm gonna be taking this Smith cosmetics - 0 brush i love how lattices it's really good for tucking under the eye and I'm gonna be going in with hot chocolate one more time and i'm just going to start upping that color and and connecting it with the outer parts this part like doing surgery will be really delicate if you are heavy-handed definitely pause and take like 20 hits forming now i'm using this mac 217 brush that we did already up here and I didn't put any new product on it i'm just going to be blending it out all right now for extra drama I'm going to be adding in a little bit of glitter in my inner corner and i'm going to be using this mac reflex read this letter is so pretty it's hard to tell on camera and so I put on my I but it's like intense and i'm just going to be putting that down with a little map - 13 brush you definitely want to put down he said because the reflex fine glitters tend to go everywhere so i'm going to be using this violet evolved loose pigment glitter adhesive and I'm gonna take like the tiniest amount is the tiny that is and just place it in my inner corner right there now i just take the glitter and open it and I just dip right in there your brush should become completely coated and I'll just knock off the little fallout back into the jar and then you're just going to press it right on there all right now for mascara i'm gonna be using my toothpaste better than sex and uses in a minute definitely been missing it I heard a rumor on Instagram mother coming with a waterproof version helpful thank God thank you lord let me just coat these entirely all right now for the bottom we're going to use the same thing and we're just going to coat them entirely you really need bottom mascara for this look because as well any part of mascara everydays now it's time for eyelashes may be using these blinking beauty lashes it says its style number two on the front so let's give them a world now I've been staying away from the latex duo but my inner corners never come up when i use it so I'm gonna be going back in and using this will let the glue dry on this one and we'll do the left i don't mean least the Lopez ok I can't believe I did these sober but my lashes are done so now it's time for the main event highlighting ok so i think because highlighting is becoming so popular every brand from joint store to high-end is creating one burberry actually started making makeup I think that your two ago and I wasn't really a fan of the formula wasn't that great but they just put out this new highlighter oh my god it's from their new runway spring summer 2016 collection and i swatched on Instagram and snapchat and everyone about died i'm gonna be using a more be 5-10 brush is my favorite for highlighting I can't stop using it oh my block wow ok definitely don't use this wet you're gonna have some issues oh my god it's so pigmented said I wasn't expecting this oh wow this is in mainly pigmented like I want to turn the camera off and just roll around in it naked and you guys know my favorite is keith was bow now because my foundation is a little darker than normal this highlight is like extremely pop in so normally i do the nose like really highlighted i'm going to really avoid that today and just take my finger and just we do the end I could literally starve myself all day right now so let's move on to the lips before this video ends up being 20 hours long for lipstick i'm going to be using my own liquid lipstick shade breathe it out sweetie i'm going to be using androgyny now I can't believe how fast that shade has sold and how like the reactions people are giving me it's so cool to see such a big response so thank you guys for showing that shade so much love I definitely have to wear it today and i

right this look is officially done alright guys I hope you enjoyed watching this look it was definitely fun for me i love that highlighter I can't like this the highlighter stole the look for me so I definitely want to turn the camera off and put on 16 more players let me know what kind of let you guys want to do next week what do you want to see let me know in the comments below I can't wait to show you what's next i will see you next time bye guys what's up everyone welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to be using something really special - I know what it is well i'm sure you can tell from the title but BAM the new great girl tart collaboration this is the swamp Queen palette listen first of all before I even looked in the inside I was dying for the packaging it looks like real wood this is amazing and sticks to the Holt our family but it is so funny like it I just I just smiled here to here when I open this the pr package you guys was genius i mean i-i got a little alligator I don't want you to be so cute delicious tried to tell him and I was like no this is the cutest thing ever and it came in come on alligator wrapping paper I can't alright so her collaboration is this amazing palette it has I shadows that has a blush bronzer and a highlight I'm like uh-huh sure you guys know just getting but this is I just can't stop looking at me like oh it's just so pretty okay the reveal bail so go ahead you guys but he also made two lipsticks which ok now this one when me and Bonnie first met a few months ago I was in Texas and she picked me up to go to the mall and we had such a fun time and she was wearing a lip and I was like girl what is that lipstick and she was in the testing phase of this one so it's so cool to see it done and on my mouth because high this color is everything this palette and the lips as a collection they are limited edition and they will be on targets website starting june six and then they slowly start to roll out into all the stores a few weeks later so don't sleep on this today i created this entire I look and the lip using this collection so I think we should have a dive right in but before we play with this I just want to say that I think it is so amazing that all these youtubers are collapsing with a really huge brand and it's it's just wild because I come from working at the mat counter and back then only a huge corporation with you know they would collab with like huge celebrities or that type of thing so the fact that all these brands are believing in you tubers and makeup artist i think is really really dope so the fact that bunny got to do this is so just so real and I'm so proud of her so bunny you really killed it with this though I'm going to dive in and let's start playing today we're going to start off by priming my eyelids with the Urban Decay primer potion I know everyone is probably like oh my god why are using primer today I'm just in a mood i saw someone use this in a review again and i was like i forgot i have primers so why not use it like to put a lot on why not right now this one is limited edition what is this one called enigma hi nygma and instead of using my fingers I'm just going to apply this with a brush all over the lid and i'm going to bring it up even to almost my eyebrow ok now that the primer is settled let's dive into the palate now you guys know I love to do a really light shadow all over for my base so i'm going to use a baby with a flat synthetic brush and I'm just going to put it over my lids now I love the shade right off the bat because it literally almost matches my skin tone so it's going to be a perfect base for me and I'm just going to drag this up an hour okay for my transition color I'm going to go right in and use dog man this is such a dope rusty brown like warm like orange base that was a long explanation but it looks really really pretty so I'm just going to take a little what is this this is a little mac - it's set in and we're just going to go right in with this one now i'm just going to take this and blend it right into my socket oh good morning this color is oh so pretty i'm really loving warm tones I think for like ten years I just wore hot blue black silver and glitter so I'm kind of 11 getting back into the season now i'm going to take this and bring it right down to their so we're gonna kind of line that up with my eyebrows start blending into that nose contour for an extreme smokey look and I'm going to bring this down and go little my lash line not too much so we're just kind of creating a little the eyeshadows just hugging my entire I now we're going to go in with a little blending brush any eyeshadow blending brush that you love now we're going to get back in the dog man just ever so slightly and we're just gonna drag up and that light shadow that I already applied earlier is really going to help buffer and blend this out obviously the brush is doing its job but this is just a little extra just a little extra precaution and it just really helps make it look really nice I'm gonna go back in one more time you guys know smokey eyes a lot of back and forth back and forth you want to blend until you have carpal tunnel the next day because we're not playing games today and then you're going to want to repeat the same steps on the other eye and make it look identical all right now we're going to go back with that same brush and I'm going to dip into sippy sippy hi it's a really that's the cue same name I love this color it's like a chocolaty maroonish brown I know my trust me i know my color explanations are ridiculous I love it the undertone of this is so pretty it has like little fine sparkles of golden it so we don't get right into her and I'm going to put this in my crease so it makes it really deep set and then we're going to drag this down a little more so that's going to give us the illusion of like a really deep set like full i M and notice how I'm still leaving space in there for maybe nothing maybe color maybe liner and I know what I want to do yet but I'm going to spring this a little more and then if you want you can go back in with your blending brush and head dog man and go in there and blend it out even more depends on how blended you want to be but I think you for watching my channel you want to be blend did so let's start doing it all right now I took that darkness and I brought it out a little past there and then you're going to take this again let it in together and just kind of flick up and out and then we're going to go back in with sippy sippy and do the same thing over here all right we are blended and looking smokey so this is like a beautiful champagne gold and i was going to take this little math 242 brush is already glitter on this from the other day so ignore that that's on the other side so we're going to go and i'm just going to place this right in there top of the line now this shadow is yummy that was thinking about wedding the brush for like extra intensity but it's so pretty as it is and like I don't need to come on amazing formula i love an eye shadow it doesn't fucking x games and we're just going to pack a little more on put a lot on that inner corner like I want my inner corner to look extra terrestrial today who so I'm going to bring it all the way in to where my brow bone and my nose connect because i'm just that type of bitch today and then we're going to go back in with this brush one more time and you don't have to dip into it again if you don't want to but I'm just gonna blend out the gold and the brown a little bit so it just blends more seamlessly from one seamless blend how's your day all right now because you guys know I cannot live without more Sparkle and gold i'm going to just take sassy button one more time and I'm gonna put some in my inner corner and i'm actually gonna bring it down in to the lower lash line up like I cannot with this color you guys hi anyone from tar is watching I'm going to sassy by a single shadow for my birthday this year ok so i want to bring it to bar in because I'm gonna smoke out this bottom but i think that is good enough and now we're going to darken and smoking out the under eye so I'm going to dab in a little bit with a man cat and i'm going to start that off and i'm just going to take this really flat synthetic brush and i'm going to just start lightly shading under my eyes and then we're going to blend it in with that gold and i am going to add in liner to my waterline I don't know what I should do maybe you to the black or cream or white so let me just smoked out this a little bit more and then we'll figure out the liner all right now that there's smoked out I'm going to darken them a little bit more and make them like really blend nicely i'm going to make them blend out a little more you know it's a little more smoky right now the edges are not how I want them so i'm just going to use a little the morphe brush high and we're going to get in with madcat one more time and now this is really gonna give me that ability to like smoke it out way more jharkhand dramatic I need that effortless blend mm-hmm now this little detailed shader brush really lets you get in there without causing a lot of fallout and it just really blends nicely all right now it's time to add something in my waterline and I don't know if I wanted you back and really like intensify my eyes or if I want to do a cream liner I wish we could take a live stream pull right now but I'm gonna go with the cream and see what happens so this is a color pop liner these released a good in the water line and this is shade honey - this shade is called honey dude and I'm just gonna see how this looks on the waterline I love a good new designer and it's sometimes hard to find a pencil that will really stage show pigment but i love this a new line it looks good on anybody I feel like it's just a different kind of love everyone else does black or some people who don't know any liner at all you know but i think this is essential and really takes a look to a whole new level it just went from walmart - hi fashion in 2.3 seconds like to really go in there so i don't have to touch up later and he's actually released and the waterline great and they're really affordable price so if you haven't tried to call her pop liners i highly suggest it what are we missing here I think I want to do a little bit of a wing yeah i think i'm gonna do a little bit of a wing so I'm just going to do that really quickly and i'll be

actually has real flakes of gold in it and it felt really nice dries quickly and my foundation look flawless so i'm going to be doing this on today and i'm going to apply this with a Gucci foundation brush yeah don't forget the neck yard and i'm going to do a little bit on the ear ok now the drying time for this is like five seconds already dry it already blurred my pores now today I want a full coverage foundation so i'm going to be going in with that kat von d lock it tattoo foundation this is my old school favorite it stays on so if you're caught in a rainstorm your foundation so go look cute and I'm shade 46 light so I like to just put this right on the Beauty Blender a damn . of course we're just gonna . around now the cool thing about this is you do not need a lot of product this covers your entire face so let's get to blending I'm just going to set my foundation and do my brows off camera which you can see how i do all that in my official face routine which is on my channel so i'll be like that all right now that my face is officially on let's get down to the look now because i'm going to be doing a lot of bright neon today i'm gonna be using the cat Mundy high voltage eyeshadow primer I love to apply this with back to 52 brush and i just use a . if you've ever used this before you know a little goes a long way with all of our products so I'm just gonna . my lid and then take this brush and start sweeping it all over so my knee and I shadows stay put and as always i'm going to sweep a little bit under the eye but not too much now we can get to our eye shadow now i'm gonna be using this busy our editorial eyeshadow palette this white color you guys I've used before this is my favorite is a nice and base for bright shadows and i'm going to be using this pink on this one and for the yellow i pulled out one of my old mac eyeshadow palette that I made myself so this yellow is called chrome yellow so we're going to be dipping into this color today as well with the same brushes my primer for i'm going to be going right to that matt white and I'm gonna highlight my brow bone with the shade and also put it online higher I area now notice how I am doing packing motions I want to pack this eyeshadow in so it does not leave me and we're going to pack pack pack all right now the first color I'm to be laying down is this bright pink now i'm gonna be using a more feet 4 11 brush to pack some of that in I'm gonna saturate this brush completely and then if you want to avoid fallout down now i'm going to start this look I'm gonna be doing three colors pink yellow pink i'm going to start this by just packing on the pink on the outside all the way to the lash line and then backing up a little bit and once again i'm doing a lot of tapping motions so it acts in that color and it has minimal fallout and this is just going to be our guide so this is not have to look perfect this is just to start look then we're going to take that pink then tuck it inside so notice how i'm leaving an area in the middle for that yellow color my eye doesn't look like a unicorn threw up on it in 10 minutes we don't have a fucking problem now to create this trifecta we're gonna pop a color right in the middle and start blending back and forth so i'm going to be using this morphy pulling that brush this doesn't have a number but it's from the bling collection I'm obsessed with this time like the present to eat it I'm going to saturate the brush so it's like me on on there and then we're just going to place it in the middle and you want to buffer it back and forth and really press it in there so it sticks and if you blend good enough it should turn a little bit orange around the corners so that pink and yellow are basically like getting married and having a baby in your eyelid and then you can take some color and start landing so if you're I does not look like a sunset by now you have some issue girl ok now to soften the lines up here we're going to be taking a mac 224 brush and we're going to dip into the pink and lightly merge the top together so i do not want this black raccoon rainbow I I want it to look very soft and pretty so we're just going to take a little bit of pink on this and follow the line that we've already created and just start blending up and just softening it now if you want to make the top even more blendable we go back in with that white color and we lightly go over the pink again and that looks very airbrush and I say Russia loss that's the effect that we're going when i add any darkness to my under eye i'm going to be taking this more feet e3 brush which by the way feels like velvet lowered and I'm gonna be taking this Laura Mercier pressed setting powder and I want to just place a little under my eyes so only reason why I'm doing this you haven't seen videos and other videos because I want to really smoke out the bottom and I don't want to deal with any fallout I was always going to be going in with my Mac smaller eye pencil this has been my favorite black eyeliner since like the beginning of time so I'm just going to take a damp Beauty Blender and as always slightly pull down so I'm not ruining the elasticity of my eyes and I'm just putting this directly in the water line doesn't have to be perfect we're going to smoke it out in a second now my eyes are very right so I do you want to create some darkness underneath so I'm gonna be using this on a stock see a shadow in shade of peacock it's like a force t jade green and I'm just gonna be taking this Mac - 19 brush and basically smudging the black out with the green on the brush BAM fallout is gone let's start blending i'm going to start from the inner corner and a lot of little small back and forth motions almost like i'm drawing and on and i'm just going to lightly start driving across the entire under I now notice how I'm taking it a little past my actual I so it gives it that really dramatic like I'm moment land yeah forward two latches and mascara i'm going to add i'm going to glitter in my inner corner and i found this glitter from lit cosmetics and it's called share chtr y'all not like I'm going to share a piece of candy we're talking to share the icon is like a silver rainbow just go like I don't know if I could have sex with the glitter i would definitely this one bowl tom ford eyeshadow brush and I'm just going to directly place this on lid and see how fucked up I get it now I know some of you are going to slap me in the face we're not using any glitter glue or adhesive and I'm just going direct from brush to face but it's staying on there ok let's start our lashes mascara i'm going to be using the benefit roller lash mascara i recently tried this and now i'm like i'm booked and I'm just going to coat my

then we're gonna dog around just like I do with my foundation and just spread this primer all around the whole face all right we're done you guys thank you so much for watching just kidding ok so now that the timer is done i am going to start mixing some foundations now i'm going to go a little different than I normally do and you guys know I love my giorgio armani luminous silk foundation this has been my go-to for all of last year they also have something called fluid shear which has like a metallic shimmer with it so you can mix this into your foundation that kind of gives you a more glowy vibe so I'm gonna make these two today now you do want to shake this very good before using oh my wrist hurts ok so let's do a little of two pumps there on the back of the hand now this glowy stuff you just put right in there now i'm just going to use the end of my Beauty Blender and just mix and then let's see what happens ok let's get to buffing now this foundation is really light i'm going to add some more coverage with powder and concealer but I feel like if you're I feel like if you're having a Valentine's date date with your spouse boyfriend girlfriend or someone off of tender you want to wear less foundation because when you have sex just gets all over their face and clothes so just be respectful for concealer i'm gonna be using the amazing cosmetics amazing concealer now i got this a while ago and I forgot to add it and I'm gonna use it today so i'm just going to use a tiny bit on my middle finger and just dab it under the I just feel so bad now i'm going to set my whole face with powder and do my brows off camera like i have been doing lately so if you want to go see how i create all that go back and look to my channel and I will be right back all right and we're back now I didn't want to contour off camera because I got these new makeup geek contour powders and i haven't used them yet so let's use them together so I'm gonna dab into this guy right here the shade is called break up and let's see how they look I'm just gonna start creating that natural I'm going to kill you bitch face consort chic look now i'm going to bring it up a little bit on my near the hairline and drag it up a little bit no I'm going to be taking this makeup forever big old man brush and I'm just going to go back in with that contour color and just chill out this chin a little bit for that define look and was going to soften that line with my Beauty Blender for the nose today I'm actually just going to take this brush and put a little product on it just half wait here and I'm just going to take it and run it down my nose where I want the color just a just a quick little to second notes job you will now I'm really defining the nose and I'm going to soften it in a second so if it looks a little too crazy you can always turn it down like this is for Valentine's so I want my nose like severe I don't want to break up with me because I didn't find her enough now that my nose looks crazy I'm going to take the Beauty Blender and just up over the line and just kind of soften them a little bit ok now let's get to the eyes all right now for eyes today I'm going to keep it really really simple like you guys are gonna be blown away how easy this is for Valentine's I want it to be really soft really pretty so I pulled out my too faced chocolate bonbon palette I love love this one first of all it's think so i'm already obsessed and oh that chocolate smell kills me I'm just going to dip into this color divinity which is a really light nude color and I'm just gonna take this from brow to lid and just coat my entire I with it we apply it is you smell the cocoa powder and you're like instantly hungry I'm like oh I want an ice cream sundae right now with a Cinnabon and strawberry lemonade oh my god now this color almost matches my skin tone which is exactly what I wanted it's just going to be a little base for us to get started make sure I shadows blend seamlessly all right now I'm just going to put a really soft brown color in the crease and I'm going to use my morphe 441 brush now the shade is called on the trouble right here it's like a really soft ma be brown I want to cut the brush completely and really get the color in there by and we're just going to tuck this into my crease and this is a really soft color we're going to be really gentle today I'm so used to seeing like bright colors are really bold right away I'm like oh like I'm not wearing anything my wrist is like bitch add more color all right now for the lid i'm going to use a metallic bronze color this is called molasses chip and this is this guy right here i'm going to just take my mac 217 brush and dip in there now usually with metallics like to wet the brush or a crazy effect let's see if this one wants to show up on my lid today oh I love that really soft all right now I'm gonna take this NARS eyeshadow it just came out and it's called turbos it's like this pretty minch like a greenish color I love and I'm actually going to add the screen color on the top of some of the brown just to give it some extra flavor and i'm going to just wet the brush always with my max plus now when you use these wet like they recommend it's like whoa so let's see what happens I live for a bitch and I'm just going to place it directly in the middle so I'm not doing my whole lid just the center now normally i would add a lot of darkness in my crease but i'm actually gonna not do that today oh god it was so weird all right now to soften those edges i'm going to be taking the same almond tropical color here and just popping over it and over it real quick all right now for under the eye i'm going to keep it really soft and gentle and i'm going to take this color in the palette called satin sheets it's like champagne the shimmery peachy I don't know it's just that's amazing i'm going to take my mac 239 brush the little guy and just dip in there I want to coat that whole brush and I'm just going to go right on the inner corner and add in that color and i'm going to bring it slightly down where it's a little bit under the eye just a little soft effect you know what's cool about these eyeshadows is you can actually use color as a highlight which I did the other day and it looked so pretty so there's ever anything metallic in your palate dip it in honey and pay those cheeks ok so now that that's done i'm just going to take that same with morphy 441 brush and I'm gonna dip into this color one more time and I'm actually just going to take it under my eye and just lightly buff under it so just give you that soft brown and we're going to slightly drag that shadow out a little bit ok now what is going to make these eyes stand out really crazy i think is that mascara and the big lashes once you add those things to your eyes it always gives you that like oh ok there it is look all right now I'm gonna take my Too Faced better than sex mascara and coat the entire top and bottom before we do some lashes now let's do the lot of mascara now when you don't have a lot of dramatic eye shadow underneath he would be really careful not to bump your skin with a brush so I'm just going over this a few times so it's like extra tarantula now I want the latches to be the main focus of this luck since it's so soft and gentle so i'm going to be using the Buddha beauty Farrah lashes now it's time to put some lash glue on and get these bitches a warm I am obsessed with how these look they're so light blue they almost look like eyelash extensions they're so pretty I'm probably never gonna take a walk no thanks all right now for highlighting today I'm going to be going in with that with the with the with the for highlighting today I'm going to do a gold-tone and i'm going to be using the new burberry highlighter this is nude gold and oh she's so pretty holy God there's another one that i am going to be filming with soon so get ready because these are insane and I'm going to be using my morphe 310 fan brush is going to be now these are like who these are insane oh god yes blow my whole goal in life is when I walk outside for my neighbors to have to like squid their eyes and they're staring at my face so let's keep packing this on under the keep with the flow and i'm going to do you all down the nose like I want this bitch I like it was going to take my fingertip and just do the end of my nose all right the highlighting is done now what we can do for the lips all right since it's so dry out and I've been a little under the weather i'm gonna be using a lip scrub from my own brand and this is the strawberry gum flavor now hi she's been used so good I'm just gonna take a little bit out and my hand just scrub away like to go in a circular motion so it gets off all that dryness cool thing about these edible so if you're feeling a little hungry why doing your makeup stick your finger and have a little snap girl I want to go for a really baby pink soft porn star hooker type of lip so I'm gonna be going in with that mac cosmetics Bianca be this is a really like sheer baby pink oh wow it is really it that's actually more pigmented than I thought it's so crazy this pink is so light it almost looks white on me like hey ok I literally feel like Dave Chappelle when he was pretending to be a crack addict so I'm actually going to take the Beauty Blender and just share this down a bit and I'm going to put this on estas hija lip gloss on top this is shade pastel pink and let's see if we can get this to look a little more oh there we go hi now you guys know I'm not a fan of lip gloss but i am loving this look all right and now to finalize this look we are going to be going in with the Urban Decay all nighter

about my hair surgery for 10 seconds because everyone keeps wondering what in the fuck is going on under that damn week at well i will have a video up in a few weeks about the entire surgery the operation the healing everything we've been filming it through several doctors appointment so I know a lot of you were like where's that video but i am still healing and the hair takes months to grow so all summer I'm gonna have 30 different hair colors also going to be reviewing this new liquid liner that i recently purchased this eyeliner is called this so intense reminder now I saw the price tag and I was like 70 mother effing dollars for a damn liquid liner now i have been using the kat von d trooper liner which looks almost the same component of course the design is way different the cat one is nineteen dollars and it's in sephora systole one I got from their website now seventy dollars i was like this better be good so this is one of those lighters where you take the cap off and it has that long kind of ink pen what it looks like you're about to sign a check or a death wish Mike okay let's try this now a lot of these you guys if you try them they get kind of dry right so like you use on after laid all set your life where the f is the product interesting thing about this one the kat von d 1 you can shake right you can feel the shaker in there you can hear it this one silent like there isn't I don't hear anything I don't already moving I don't hear anything so I don't know how that liner is going to keep coming out without you forcing it to maybe just naturally does which would probably a gift from Jesus so we're gonna give this a world today and do it extreme black liner i have already done my full foundation my brows and a little bit of contour so if you want to see how I do that look through my channel bar down and find the jeffree star official face routine all right let's get started as always I'm going to coat my entire lids from brow all the way to that last line with a white shadow now I want to look very mannequin very Barbie today so I found this brand on Instagram they're called super beauty love this cute packaging now the formula for these is on real if you haven't heard of this brand yeah I would definitely check them out on IG here is one of their palates this is the neutral a necessity palette really cute name now is watch this on snapchat the other day oh my god they look really good so this white one looks amazing it's called prohibition pub and i'm just going to be dipping into their morning let's start blending now I want this really light under my brow bone so obviously if you are not really pale like me use a color that little more to your skin tone this one can be really harsh but i'm going for that doll like effect today do you guys ever have this moment where you kind of like you're right eyebrow more than left now listen when you have to draw him on every single day and try to match them sometimes i like the right one a little more and that's definitely happening today now i'm going to do is some warm tone little smoky neon drama in my crease before we try out that liner and i'm going to be starting off with my violet of Oz holy grail palette i have been using this so much off camera like what I've been going out lately to events and stuff I've really been obsessed with this one high hashtag is like a godsend so we're gonna be dipping into that one today the fuck brushes this is the mac 217 I'm going to coat my entire brush BAM off this is such a good warm neutral color literally my new favorite so then i'm also going to take some and bring it a little bit down on the lash line and understanding really soft and gentle and dragging it out now that this transition color is laid down I'm going to dip into my melt cosmetics radioactive eyeshadow stack these are so pretty oh hi good morning the shade is called radon and i am going to be placing this right over what we just did and i'm going to start on just that this half of my eyes so just the outer edges or corners and that white shadow should really help to blend this and make it look pretty but a dip into that Lauren I'm actually gonna bring it down I just love the wait neons look blend it out so I'm actually going to bring it and even more so this is really going to give us that plastic doll like appearance with that really dramatic like who hi now i'm going to go back into this palette and dip into this beautiful warm chocolate brown shade is called Islander and i'm going to take this little mac - 1 in detail brush and I'm just going to add and a little bit of warmth and depth to my crease really lights almost like we are doing surgery let me lift up my head a little bit now there will be light are going there so I'm not going to connect it if you're like bitch what the hell time to drive assistant Lee eyeliner we're going to put it to the test we're gonna give it a world all right now i'm going to start dragging the wing now i will say this liner does have a lot of pigment usually by now have to like shake and twirl and try to get more pigment out but this that keeps on coming out I'm surprised the eyeliner keeps on coming it's kind of like my last bukkake it's just not stopping and i still this still has pigment maybe because it's holding it down and it's like seeping into the applicator which would be genius hi but uh this is still full of liner like it's not stopping one side and down one to go who she's take the wheel alright guys we finally hit our first snag the ink is drying out where the liner excuse me and it is getting kind of hard to use this is not acceptable it is drying up a little bit so i'm going to close it give it a minute and we're back ok so basically we had to shake it and twirl it and now we're back ok alright so let's finish this I so I want to see how this is gonna wear throughout the day but so far who I'm like I like it I like it a lot first impressions it's black it's great full coverage and I need a full coverage liner now it does it beat the kat von d liner it has its pros and cons this brush is bigger and I felt like I could do the top part quicker but kind of the same so do i think it's worth seventy dollars up not really sorry I was so high on LSD i forgot to put my white liner on so I'm going to take my mac fascinating as always and we're just going to paint that water line ghost white but be careful it doesn't touch the black liner it will turn gray and I don't want to grab my water once that whites in their bitch it's over it's like I game changer now today before my lashes i'm going to try a new mascara as well this is that nor couture black satin mascara now listen this kind of looks like the top of my packaging so I was obviously drawn in by the Stars this component is really cute now here's what got me when I saw this bullshit at the mall y'all see that ok so we're going to give it a world today I'd never use this brand-new fresh out the tube so let's try it together I don't know how that you're supposed to use this but let's try no not really seeing that much of a difference here definitely not all no not really loving this one in the drawer she goes now Sicily same brand as the liner they have any mascara how you got that this week today I haven't tried it this is the so curl deep black mascara love this cute little too but now the brush has a slight little angle ok q let's try this one oh wow okay already uplifting now not that this is like a huge huge difference but it definitely lifted my lashes more like on this side of definitely didn't know now bottom mascara is very key with this look because we are doing no shadow I know it breaks my heart as well it's really weird but I feel like if you have no shadow without white liner it's very uplifting and very mannequin like so I'm gonna hoping prince was not fuck up my bottom lashes or twice call me a problem now today for false lashes i'm gonna be using the hood of beauty Farrah mmm these 3d foam inks girl now when I talked a few videos ago about lash glue and how i hated smell you guys like overwhelmingly sent me thousands of tweets and snapchat about the house of lashes glue and now he said it smelled amazing and it was really good and held on my inner corners so so pleasant I've tried this over the last few days it does really work great shout out to house of lashes hi love you and we're just going to paint that entire lash and we're going to get two glowing who these are vicious and now for highlighting who do I got something special for you guys today so I was shopping around the other day getting some groceries and bam wet and wild slapped me and my mother effing faced with this gorgeous highlighter now when the store lights rain down this palette my eyes first locked on it I was like forever oh and cool thing about this it is a cruelty-free friend now this shade is called precious petals and this is only 399 girl I open this up I tried it the other day delicious so I'm gonna be dipping with my honest Ostia a 23 brush bam bam that's all you need girl and I'm just going to place this right above my contour this is so pretty it is like a light golden yellow oh you see that mm like hmm where else am I going to put this the Cupid's bow duh being can you see me now now that I'm blinding everybody let's get down to the lips her lips today I'm going to kind of a classic nineties nude lip I'm going to start by using this mac lip liner in shade hover and i'm just going to outline my entire lives so I'm kind of creating a little ombre effect already by just taking a pencil and just kind of looking up really lightly so it just gives it the more soft appearance while giving you a harsh darker line down here all right we are live line but now for lipstick today I'm gonna be pulling out a little christian louboutin if you've never seen this packaging oh I mean this a full-blooded Instagram and when my favorite shoe brand create a lipstick I about died so i picked one of the mat nude shades hi packaging is amazing good morning now i'm just gonna take it out of the packaging you just have to unscrew the top off and it comes out hi this looks like a Christmas ornament or it could be a butt plug the packaging is genius expensive it feels amazing now this shade is called to tell i'm not sure how you say that I think it's French so there that this shade is such a pretty gorgeous nude let's try it oh I'm dying I don't need more of just applying more because it just feels so damn good this is such like a pretty everyday color now I like to do is I'll go back in with the lip pencil and i will just cut a lightly go over the lines again just so you keep that kind of our great fact now I think the only thing that is stopping me from being done is a little setting spray and a damn winged now besides using my favorite Urban Decay all nighter I found something new at the mall now heals the skin care i have loved and adored for a really long time you have some really good night creams hello anti-aging now they have a new spray it's the cactus flower and Tibetan ginseng hydrating mist who know the mouthful now hi it's green really cute it smells really fresh so i think i'm gonna give a little up you know little double fisting again today so this one you do not need to shake this one I'm definitely to be shaken better let's get to town oh this feels so good ok so i think I'm hydrated yeah a little more camera right hold on maybe decide what might hear it was a little dry ok now let me get some hair on and finish this look this is the final look I'm obsessed with this the liner and this highlight I think the liner did pretty good do I think this liner was worth the price not really i think there are definitely a lot of dupes out there so this is not a necessity like dick cotton candy and lip gloss but it was definitely fun to try now I have a huge surprise for my next

palette for the eyes but I'm gonna do a little fast forward and show you guys that face routine just in case you don't need a little refresher so today I'm actually gonna go back in with my law / a foundation now I reviewed this a few weeks ago to know a lot of your like having anyone and it's actually really really dope so i'm going to apply a lot of this on and i'm gonna be using my artiste overall a brush I'm obsessed with these brushes like I'm just going to take this out of the thing hi spatula and just like last time i was going to paint them on you know me I like to go really overboard me overboard never now I didn't build this up last time i used it and off camera i've been wearing a lot and it's just really pretty it has this like luminosity to it that most foundations do not have come on forehead and and bam all you do is you're going to take this brush and you're just gonna brush it around your skin and it literally covers it wick like oh hi hi left side of my face you already done and you're just gonna massage it into your skin and brush it on oh we just have a moment of silence for how good the shit smiles I'm just like all right now the concealer that was in this guy-- it's a little too heavy for me under my eyes I don't like to cake on all that makeup I don't really need it myself so I'm just going to go back to my old school jeffree star method I've coating my entire face with Studio Fix so we find a big old brush my favorite powder brushes is Tom 405 brush it's just like it's perfect so we're going to dip into this guy and cover my entire mug so we're just creating a really mannequin like masks today if you don't need as much foundation just fast forward but if you do pause and apply it with me and notice how I'm kind of like smashing the brush into my face I am packing it on a much just kind of like aa girl you can't do that you gotta pack it into the skin because we are not going to be touching up later we are too busy for that we got too much way too small too many dicks to suck and we got too many shopping trips to do so we're going to hack it and pack it on and of course we're not going to forget our neck we're going to avoid grandma was that girl and we're going to adjust our ears ever so slightly all right now highlight and contour an old-school trick that I've been doing since the myspace days is I found this mac studio fix it is literally ghost white so instead of packing on all that concealer under the eyes which I don't really need it all the time i'm just going to take this little nars kabuki brush and I just like to buff this under my eyes almost like a little upside down like triangle motion we're gonna bring it all the way to my hairline because I do like that extreme glamour and we're just gonna stuff it under and blend it in just really get that in there and that will ensure it does not move throughout the day now other areas that I do love to highlight because i'd like to look very plastic I love doing a little bit on the chin haha no chickens been a minute how you doing girl how's your morning all right now we're highlighting the gods it's time to contour the space a little bit now i'm going to try something today we're don't go with severe huh I know I I couldn't do that came out of my mouth either but I'm just trying to look today so I'm gonna be using my little Chanel foundation bronzer brush I love the sky it's like airbrush on a stick and hi kat von d how are you I'm just gonna dip into that middle one and just got lightly on the darker one and I'm just gonna just chill these cheeks a little bit hmm now i'm just going to do a little circular but emotions and i'm only going to do my contoured here today usually you guys my love to go all the way down but i'm just gonna softly do it this way today I just see how i like it if I hate it great cool thing about makeup is it washes off and you can have new cheekbones tomorrow so lets buff out this face forehead nose and chin and pray that we look cute she's going dark on that for today girl you know what them wigs got a really great that dimension where bronze buffed and beautiful now I guess it's a time for some eyebrows just kidding i forgot my nose mother effer and now we're going to breathe through these averages using on it starts at beverly hills dipbrow and brow ways alright browser on now let's get to these eyes now today i'm going to create a little go to easy look that i am going to show you mah oh my war oh my today i'm going to show you a little quick go to look using that beauty killer palette oh now you can tell them really obsessed with China white here because the j in the pan is like the exchange this is like my go-to I talked about this in the swatch video i have been putting a light color shadow under my brow bone since the dawn of time so I'm just going to take China white and just bring it all the way down and i'm just going to coat my entire lid from lash to brow bone a whole damn thing now I cast a lot why use a really light shadow of course you can use your favorite primer which I do do that sometimes but when you're using any other bright or dark colors this easily blend it out if you didn't have anything already down there so this is kind of like my primer i guess you could call it and we're just going to take China white and just butt hurt the gods now i'm going to take this mac low 22 for blending brush we're going to get right into Kourtney and this is going to be our transition color this is really easy everyone should be able to use this color and we're just going to pop this right in my crease it's an easy transition color I think anyone can pull this off it's going to help you blend out your other shadows or you can literally just wear this in your crease and pop a lash on and get ready for the day since i have no eyebrows I like to be a little bit more dramatic with my shadow so of course if this is too much for you can tailor and tone it down to fit your needs but i just love Courtney it's such an easy color it's like if you want to stop from those edges you can dip back into trying to wait just a little . on your little blending brush and you can just going to go over the edges and just soften them out so they look really soft and pretty i'm really loving and vanity so I want to dip that in and create kind of a little deep socket in there and I have a special surprise for you guys ready for the surprise because this isn't even in the description is the name of the title but i'm going to debut it here for you guys so I have a collab coming out with morphe brushes yes i am obsessed with that you guys know how to use them in all my videos I'm going to show you a little sneak peek of a few of them should we do it should be doing ok we're doing it BAM oh this is the first time I'm like really ever showing these and a little sneak peek on Instagram and these are just four of ten brushes coming out they are pink chrome they have the logo on it and the morphe brush logo sorry my lighting is so it's too pretty it's like not showing my Legos they are vegan cruelty free and they're so soft now I know a lot of people are vegan brushes can be a little rough business jeffree star you know the shit was like I it was good so I'm gonna be using been minus one more P jeffree star automatic sprinkler brush and we're going to dip into vanity I created brushes that only i would use obviously not going to create something that I would not use on myself so we're just going to dip into this and of course will do a full reveal with all the brushes soon for a video but i had to give you guys a little sneak be sleepy so i'm gonna talk vanity right in my crease and just very own just put her right in there now i am going to keep my eye makeup really minimal today so this define crease is detrimental and I'm not going to bring it all the way down my nose to see how I look this way I look down I just gonna stopped it where the socket meats and i'm just going to drag and blend it out a little more yes blending brush feel so soft and it's not like it's a Christmas pie it's all right now for this lid color notice how i did leave some room right here i want to pop in some gold now you can put the gold in the middle you can put it on the corners i don't know what i want to do yet but I'm going to be dipping into rich bitch with a little synthetic flat brush and I'm going to coat the entire back and front of this I don't know where I want to place it yet let's just give it a whirl and see what happens that brush is a little too small so i swapped it out for one of my blending brushes and i'm just going to pack this on the lid oh it is so pretty and I'm gonna put it right below vanity and mm just get a little schoolgirl hmm now a little cute trick if you want to wet the brush with your fixed plus it will make the pigment really stand out so if you want extreme pigment i would definitely wet the brush a little bit now notice how I'm in it tuck this into here but not bring it all the way up so I'm just going to kind of bring it down right there and that's it now for under the eyes you can do really anything you want a lot of times i like to leave it minimal and not really do much but today I'm gonna kind of smoke it out because they keep putting in like white or nude eyeliner on my waterline so I want to give it a little bit of depth today I'm just going to pop in this max moulder in my waterline and there we go really thinly and they're not too crazy and i'm using my Beauty

swatch reveal on that and i have even more liquid lips coming out you can sometimes plank for 2016 because i am not slowing down so in April we got a new life with lips and the highlighters toward the

on line and you live in the area you better be there right now put on some sunglasses crack open a red bull and enjoy this look now just start i'm actually going to leave no brows today now that i have is amazing bangs I don't browse so we're gonna stick to the very goth alien jeffree star 10th grade look at how you used to do and to start this i'm going to coat my entire lid with a white skin color based and today i'm gonna be using the new Kat Von D shade and light contour quad who is a mouthful and this is the rust palette I love her new packaging like hi this is very high and and these are the four colors that come with it these are not often enough so we're just going to stick with this light one today just for the base and then we'll move on to a different palette but let's see if these are pigment did oh I and hi cat never fails to deliver so I am already excited both the entire lid and i'm actually gonna bring the shadow up all the way and i'm going to take this and pull it all the way back so it would be a lot easier to blend later google pastel god there is a different like variation of the looks that everybody gives it's like mainly a dark lip and kind of light eyes or sometimes it's like a pastel and really dark I'm going to give it a little Jeffrey twist and i'm going to dive into this sugarpill heartbreaker palette and we're going to go riding with this hot glue called velocity over my lower they are really highly pigmented you touch your brush once oh good morning and they're ready to play so I'm going to using my Chanel eyeshadow my blending brush I love this one and I'm just gonna dive in and start sketching out a little bit of a crease if you want you can stretch it out a little higher or you can stick to your natural crease line I have no brows I have a little bit more room to play with and I'm definitely going to be banking on that today so i'm going to take this and since i have no brows i want to create a long like them and definition to the eyes i'm going to be taking the shadow I'm going all the way and then we're going to drag and this doesn't have to look perfect because we are going to use another brush to blend up but the base shadow that we previously just applied is definitely going to help blend everything out already so I think you all right now i'm going to drag that all the way down to my lash line just a little bit in there notice i'm leaving some room for color right here and color right there i'm going to add into more colors actually so you don't want to take the blue too far and just kind of doing a half way into my eyelid and of course we'll puff and blend out that better so no worries today we're gonna be pulling up this makeup gem this is that Natasha day Nona palette it's one of the palette she has like a million these common way you know just like you know one or two shades good morning so I'm looking at this palette clearly this one this one and this one it needs to get all on this face so first we take this sky blue amazing this and i'm gonna be using that sugar pill blending eyeshadow brush and I'm just gonna be dipping into that one all right now I'm going to take that color merge it with that darker one that we just put on and i'm just going to kind of blend up and out I'm gonna merge those two and use it as a lending color and then we're going to go back in with our first blending brush with a little extra product of that cat palette and we're just gonna blend come on sky blue and this is where i'm going to drag it out a little bit more and blue and an o.d yeah i'm going to add in a little pop of colors so I mean look there are so many options i'm looking down on all these eyeshadows and I'm just like why did you do this to me why now there's this really pretty cyborg foiled silver now I've used this once before and I wedded the brush I wet the brush when it went better fucking whatever i'm going to use my mac fix+ this is the lavender flavor and I'm just gonna coat this Bobby Brown little blending brush and we're just going to dip into that silver and oh my god it's like whoo all right we're just going to take that silver right on the lid yes and just start packing that in there now if you don't let the brush you might not get the desired intensity that you want so i definitely recommend doing that and I'm going to take it all the way down now we are going to blend out this part a little bit in a second so if you're like girl that was a little janky I am definitely not done and because my sockets are so big i'm actually going to bring that silver all the way to my like nose basically in there and see that my turn to the side it looks so pretty now my lids don't look like Terminator I fucked me then we just didn't do it enough so i'm going to keep layering and layering now that the silver is down I definitely need to go in and blend out a little more so we're just going to go back with their first blue I like to press a little bit around the edges of where that silver was so we're just kind of having emerged become besties or you know lovers whichever way you guys want to do it now - adding a little bit of death and drama I'm gonna get going in with this really dark dark blue shade in here and i'm actually going to touch this little duochrome moment right here i'm going to take the dark blue actually and do a little bit under my eyes as well let's do the crease first so I was taking a little mac 217 and that dark blue is so big and it like you really got to be careful so I'm going to be really delicate and start tucking that dark color a little bit in there this is for depth and drama if you want it a little lighter just skip this part but I'm gonna take that sugar pill brush one more time and just help blend and blend all right actually switched my idea so I did the darkness on here with my crease and then I'm like going to add even more color I think it's pretty good for now until we do lashes for the top i'm like okay i'm loving this it's very like alien cyborgs sky blue like I don't even know Titanic drowning sexy i don't know what the fuck I'm saying but you guys get the drift I'm loving it let's move to under my eyes okay so i was looking at all my makeup trying to find a good paint and of course I pull up more sugar bill this is the pro palette you can usually get these at like the imap makeup trade shows or that type of thing I don't think they sell them online but there's a pink in there right there and I'm like ooh girl so we're going to dip into that and i'm also going to do a little more inner corner under and I found this inglot pigment eyeshadow it is so pretty so i am going to give that a world today and i'm going to be using my little mac - 19 pointy brush I know what I don't normally use inglot a lot on my channel but i am obsessed with this pigment so once again we're going to let that brush a little bit and I like to just pour some of the pigment into the cap like so so I'm just going to take this and put it right at the inner corner oh my god and gagging this is so pretty this is the definition of like has to drop I'm being really delicate as usual and barely touching my skin imagine this is like a highlight on my cheek who I might have to do that like every day now and because I have OCD and glitter obsession I'm just going back over and over honestly I think one layers and but this is the jeffrey show here we're going to do like 16 layers all right now we're going to dip into that sugar Belle paint with the exact same brush let's keep it moving in and I'm just gonna continue to drag this out now this pink is very think so be careful we're just going to merge these two together and notice how i'm not going to go all the way because i am going to take that dark blue that we put in my crease the second ago and we are going to bring a little bit of that down so i'm not gonna do the entire thing oh my god that's like Pinker the papacy ok now the pink is laid down my cock in with this really really dark blue and i'm going to be using this little more the five of seven brush a little detailer what's up girl I love this little guy so we're just gonna really lightly start in there and I'm going to take the start blue and just merge it with that pink really thin like we want this under I to look like a cotton candy orgasm you want these eyeshadows to merge together so it should create a little kind of purple moment which is what happens with blue and pink get to get there hi color wheel all right now I'm not going to do a wing for this look but i am going to smudge a little black liner where the lashes are going to go i think there's so much color going on here it just needs a little bit of depth so I'm going to take my mac smolder pencil and I'm just gonna really lightly like we're talking barely there so I'm just going to kind of tight line in there so really minimal that is now obviously it's not so much yet somebody's my little more feet 508 brush I love this and i'm just going to take that and smudge out that top liner just a hair all right now before we do mascara and latches i'm going to do some white eyeliner and you're like oh my god so more liner girl we are not done this is an intricate little look so we're going to take max fascinating white pencil this is my favorite for the waterline who are going to hold your breath and just get through this one real quick if you hit your waterline so we're going to take this pencil and we're just gonna put it right in the water line now because of all these bright colors you've got to be careful because this liner gonna hug on to color as well like take it and turn like pink so you've got to be really careful now I think this really completes the look it's like that extra subtlety all right now for lashes you definitely want to look like adults so we're going to first coat or latches with the new to face waterproof better than sex oh my god I told you guys I had been waiting to try this this is one of my favorite mascaras so let's see what happens a same amazing once before let's see how this works now I got so excited I blinked and got mascara under my eye so i'm just going to use a little primer to wipe it off camera i'll be back in two seconds all right i did my whole entire mascara off camera actually got it on my hair like a girl was having a moment when slow deep breath and I got too excited and got it all over myself so mascara is on now it's time for lashes we're going to do something really soft and wispy and natural haha just kidding we're going to go in with the new sugar pill eres lashes oh my god i saw these and I was like these were made for me let's put these babies on and just see what happens I'm just going to put these right on the latch line oh my god i'm going to take tweezers and help press these on so this to a fabulous oh shit users some of those lashes that you just gotta hold in place for a second let God do it's it's magic I was gonna weigh them below oh my god Amy from sugarpill if you are watching this you have created my new favorite lashes these are so dope I'm like hi I'm obsessed okay i can start these eyes for like six more hours but you guys know what time it is it's time for the main event highlighting all right now I'm going to stick to the true golf pastel looks so if you notice today I don't really do any contour which is so weird for me I'm like where's my cheekbones and other there I want to be using this blush highlighter from burberry now you guys know I'm over a very poor i am live thing for that packaging it's just so cute so basically the white part the highlight are inside the blush it's more subtle than it looks and smells like a lush bath bomb that is so crazy yummy okay so I'm gonna be using this chanel powder brush and it says just just swirl around oh wow let's pray and this is not who pigmented because i do not want Rosie ass cheeks I want to really finally just kinda oh wow ok we'll be sharing that down in like two seconds so okay hyper very least we know you have pigment thank God the worst is when he spend money on these higher end brands and then they just suck dicks oh thank god that is nice so i am going to take that all the way and let's just blend the little more now if you if you put too much blush on like I just get in you're like oh my god you can just take a powder brush and like a little bit of your powder so today we use that having a quad I'm just going to dip into their and then I'll go back in with that blush and put it on top and just kinda we go we want to share it down cute now it's like my cheeks are flushed and ready to kill ok now i haven't done just blushed without really any contour and so long I

goes a really long way i know i've set up before other videos in your public bitch please listen we're barely going to touch this that's what you need and we are going to put this highlight right on top of that blush now this shade is called ice cold and it is for really pale people so you see that I've barely even touched my cheek it's already like buried on so you really don't need to use a lot now obviously for me want to use more than the average bear but i am just so excited for these two finally come out I not been talking about them for a few months I really wanted to perfect the

obviously full and long again so i'm gonna be pushing my hair color and every video so I hope you enjoy this blonde bombshell moment and keep watching let's get started so as you can see I've already done my foundation and contour and powder highlights so if you want to see how we do that go back to my channel and find the official jeffree star face routine video all right now to get this crazy neon smokiness i'm going to use the lightest shade from the Kat Von D shade + light eye palette i'm going to be using the best guy today and I'm just going to take my mac to 52 as always my go-to and we're going to take that white color coat the entire bristles and then you guys know what I'd love to do it take that highlight right under the brow and just start blending down now I know a lot of you left to prime i do prime my lids sometimes but since I've been doing makeup I always just take a light color and bring it all the way down so it's kind of my primer love to take the shadow and bring it all the way past the brows so all the way there once it hits my face tattoo I know I'm good who hey all right now let's start putting some neon colors on i'm going to go to one of my go-to favorites is that Urban Decay electric palette i love this one now it says that a few of the shades or not I save and a lot of you're probably like really read the unit carton on this it says that some of the shades are not I say meaning that there's some dyes that they used in their formula that may stay in the lids so I personally do not care i know my eyelids are not going to fall off and then I don't mind looking like i had pink eye for a few days because i just put foundation right over it so going to make a little cut crease type of moment with my eyes i'm going to be using the occ cosmetics color pencil in shade animate this is what I used for my pink browse and a few of my last videos so what this i'm actually going to sketch out my lid of where I'm gonna now draw it on so this is like an old-school trick I used to do back in the j so basically just sketching out where i'm going to draw and I like to bring the pencil all the way down in my water and bring it a little outside the line now this is obviously not supposed to look perfect such as like a little sketch that we're going to be a shadow on top of so don't think like damn bitch you look a messy so that's my little sketch q now i'm going to take this chanel eyeshadow blender sounds like really don't mean I'm gonna take some pink eyeshadow from this palette we're going to do shade savage which is this pink eye right here and I'm just going to coat the entire brush like so high by fall out we're actually going to take this brush and go over that line that i created and this is where you're going to buff it out and blends so force that line was definitely not perfect it was just more so to be a guide just guide me through this girl and I like to take this make it go all the way down the nose a little very airbrushed hello eighties makeup how are you and i'm just going to start buffing up so notice how i was doing little back and forth motions to give it that really nice airbrushed look that I have been known for forever we're just going to go up and up so just soft little brush motor like emotions and we're blending and blending and blending i'm going to take the shadow brush and dab it on my lid so it kind of creates that like halo half see type of moment and we're just going to go back and forth so this is like the foundation of the neon pink like she's getting there we're going to add in some more depth but this is just like the outline ok so then I'm going to take that first blending brush and without any extra product i'm just gonna kind of buff over the pink at the top edges just so it gives it a really nice blendy look before we go in with even more color all right now we're going to go in with this orange color is called a slow burn I and i love this one it really complements this one so I'm just going to dip it in and i'm gonna be using a little blending brush from Gucci i'm obsessed with these bristles they're so soft it feels like i don't know i don't even know what it feels like it just makes my eyelids come now these do have a little bit of fallout so high then we're just going to go in the middle now you don't have to necessarily do this perfect there's no like way to put on the orange I was kind of blending it in with the pink and dragging up unlike that outside so notice how the orange will not go in its just going to go on the outsides I want to give it some dimension and get my I some death so I'm just going to put that orange almost over the pink and it kind of creates a custom color and then drag it out even more since I we have no brows we can do whatever we want and just bring it all the way out love it so it's good it's kind of like a little sunset ombre moment and then if you want you can go back in with your first blending brush open up that cattle in G and take that light color one more time I just put a little bit on the brush and then we're going to go over that one more time and make sure it looks like I everything is airbrush now before i do all that smoky drama and make my eyes i am going to do a little wing and i'm gonna be using the kat von d liquid liner in trooper now I love this you just give it a little shake and the applicator is genius it's really fine and thin like hmm so I'm literally just going to take this and start painting and all that wing now I like to go from the middle and kind of create my shape and then I'll go down and start mapping it out but I love this pencil because it's a really cool way so if you were like on the go I have to go to business meeting and then you know to an orgy this one is definitely something you want to invest in now a lot of the times with liner i will take a mirror and get really close in there and just kind of go for it because sometimes the vanity mirrors are not good enough now what I'm doing this you guys I hope my breath so excuse the silence yes eyeliner let's get to smoking at the bottom and i don't mean crack cocaine I grabbed my trusting max smolder pencil and I'm just gonna slowly drag it in the water line now this liner is perfect for smudging if you want 24-hour stay liner this is not it this is for purposes of smudging out the bottom and making them look like heaven so we're just gonna put a little bit on the waterline you want to drive down too much because it might smear now for the bottom i'm going to take my mac - 19 pencil branch pipe n soul and I'm gonna take this shadow called urban it's this one is this hot purple like Omar growing i love this purple color so usually when you find a purple from any brand it's not good like it doesn't show up good enough but this one oh my god so I coat the entire brush like she's pigmented and I'm just gonna take this and start to drag it so i take the pencil brush and I start putting the shadow over that black and I'm really careful it's almost like we're doing surgery and I just start dragging it across now we're going to use another brush in a second but this like really gets it defined and it depends on how dramatic you want you can really bring it down like I am or you can share it down a little more it's up to you I'm always like go bold or go home then I'll take a little bit out with that wing and kind of mix in with the orange so we're like we're taking it there and then we're going to take the more feet 5 14 it's like a little detail brush and I'm going to dip it into that purple but i'm also going to take the next one called jilted right here and I'm just going to dab that on top of it so when i buffed out kind of gives it a little more depth a little more like oh hey and i'm just going to take it right over the purple and just slowly drag it across so this will soften all those harsh edges and just kind of give it a more defined luck just a little high-fashion Couture if you will now i'm just going back in one more time with the kat von d trooper liner I'm just kind of merging my corners of my eyes together so they look cohesive and like they're all one unit just tiny little details that I like to do and then I'm gonna take that urban decay jilted shade one more time with this morphe brush and just really smoke it out so it's like who lowered now what what is left with his eye besides lashes i think we are good i wasn't add some silver but i like the way that light shade is still on my lid i didn't really put another color there and i like that so i'm actually gonna go back in with that light shade right here and I'm just gonna add a little bit of it in here so it's like extra whoo hi good morning want to go in with my benefit roller lash I still can't get over this i got just I love it if you have tried this mascara let me know in the comments below if you love it i love this applicator it is perfect for top and bottom oh right come thru bottom mascara I think it's really important it's like to me hi such a big difference and this mascara really let's the bottoms like have a have their moment so we're just going to take it the nest it and then go out and under now if i don't like how my bottom ass girl looks I will brush a little calm through this is a little off morphy 22 mascara home and always going to calm it down because when you get ready every single day your lashes take like extreme abuse so I'm like Lou I am happy with how this is looking so let's put on our lashes now I want real real big draw but for these lashes today so i'm going to be using that new bounce some Russian black these are who these are so dramatic they're like double stacked on one strip it's like it's but it's it's

another blending brush and we're just going to jump into the lonely violet vice palette now this has really great neutrals i love the look that we're going to recreate i basically had like a transition color coming all the way in here cutting out my crease and I left that blank and a really bright neon liner so we're just going to take a Toby color and we're going to take it all the way and cut out that lid and then we're going to leave this all blank for that neon liner to have its a moment so i'm going to be dipping into a ragamuffin right here and and we're just going to talk this right in here take this color little more and then we're just gonna talk it and put a little bit on that lid just what kind of all flows together so i am going to blend this out of course we are not leaving it like that but i'm just going to sketch it out on the other side as well and then we'll get your buffing and blending and now we're going to take this lighter shade called mama bird we're just going to dip into that and then we are going to blend out then make this look really airbrushed and then I'm going to get back into that white eyeshadow with the first brush and I'm just gonna talk that white right in there so it really cuts that out like I come back and we're just going to leave that blank and then the same thing for the top we're just going to go over and make sure it looks really blended all right now let's get to the neon liner last time i use this hot yellow which looks so stunning this one is called dance party and I think it's sold out like immediately you guys were like hi I knew that Joe is the hot green what some call this one is called fanny pack hi really cute so these are water activated now last time i use this really really tiny brush this is the 202 liner brush from Smith cosmetics love this guy and this is water activated i'm just going to take a tiny little bit of water from this a high no one's tried is planted before you got the wrong one I feel like a super bowl commercial but this is just my favorite water I'm just going for a little bit in this camp now we're going to take that liner and we're just going to move it around huh oh so pretty i want to scream so I poured out some of the water now i'm just going to kind of move it around and then it gets really pigment did so you're just gonna want to take the liner brush and oh my god all right now I'm going to bring this up a little bit and just kind of put it over our shadow all right the liner is done and he's also come in a lot of other shades so I can't wait to get more and it was like a hot blue there's like a pink and we also have like black silver and other cool colors so definitely be getting a million of these is going to like my new stable color I'm like oh what is next mascara and you're probably like what is that it that's all I did the other day now you can take something in the water line if you want to add a little pop for mascara today I'm gonna be taking the iconic mascara from Gucci this is my new favorite i love the brush on this guy is so easy to work with and we're just going to coat our entire bottoms and top all right now for lips today I'm going to prep them with some lip scrub this is my own of a lower lip scrub in flavor spearmint and I like to just take some of my fingers and just go to town alright lips are smooth and already now today i'm going to be using my own the lower liquid lipsticks in shade or water melon soda and we're going to dab a little bit of a nude beach in the center for some extra dimension of course I'm going to leave a little bit in the center for a nude beach so I'm not going to fill it in all the way and now we're going to take a little bit of a nude beach and we're just going to press it right here and then we're going to take a little more key eyeshadow brush and we're just going to blend this in I love how this looks now of course if you want you can do a . in the center on your top left I kind of like to just leave it on the bottom so it gives my lips that extra like alright guys so this look is pretty much done you really don't need anything else of course if you want to add on more highlight because you have a really bad crazy obsession with highlighters you can always dip in and you know do a little bump it's been you know probably like 20 minutes since we put on you know the highlighter so of course if you want to read you more of course you can but besides that I think we're gonna need a little bit of setting spray ok so it since it is summer we're going to bring out our touch at dewy skin missed and we're just gonna shake and Shake and I wish nathan is here to help me with three more setting sprays but let's get our engines ready and let's get to spraying all right this look is complete alright guys this look is done it is probably one of my quickest looks I think taking away false lashes and tons of eyeshadow obviously saves you a lot of time so of course if you want to tailor this look do some black wings some silver some gold and yellow any color will work i think it's summer it's fun I mean I don't even care if it's Christmastime I just want to wear bright colors all the time and for lips could really swap this out with anything if you're afraid of bright colors just us straight up nude and you're still going to select or just do some light gloss

damn computer blender the powder literally melts onto your skin all right now for contour I just got the new more feet contour kit now i have never used this before hi these pants sizes are amazing what we're going to go in with this guy maybe this one and I'm gonna be using the morphe 527 brush and I'm just going to take this and follow my natural contour line oh hello pigment yeah morphy ok the pigmentation and quality on this palette is sick a name now if you're going to share down your contour you can always check your powder brush and go over a hair I'm just going to go along the sides of my things real quick car about that chin but without that forehead morphy gave me this new nose contour brush to try the other day this is that be 47 when I saw it I was all mmm but they go it's hard for the nose a lens amazing so let's try and now knowing how pigmented these are I am totally going to be sparse and just dipped into a once okay and let's see what happens is bringing into my eyebrow bone structure i'm also going to bring the shadow down so it caps off mine own now i'm going to take the Beauty Blender again and just lightly about this all right now i'm going to do my

dip into that one and i'm going to be using my trusty Mac 252 brush as always now I love to pack this in so don't just swipe it around your eyes like really pack in that color now since i'm going to be doing my whole entire lid covered in rainbow glitter I definitely need a transition color so i'm going to be using the melt cosmetics Dark Matter stack and this first color I die it's called blur and i'm just going to be placing that in my crews and i'm gonna be using a mac - - for blending brush and we're just going to dip into this one and I'm just going to kind of create or around my I just really get into that crease now I don't want it too dark so I'm just going to lightly blend avoiding my lid area and i'm going to bring that down just wear my contour ended before and it was dragging it out past my i know i do you want to add a little bit more depth into that crease so i'm going to be taking the color right below it which is called unseen and i'm just going to do a little bit more more towards the middle so I have more of a depth and you know more definition come through transition color okay i'm going to put it a little bit on my lid right by the lash line but just on the outer corner all right now before I coat my entire lid with glitter I do need to color to put down before that and i'm going to be using this purple metal crush eyeshadow from kat von d this color is called danzig and it's so pretty I'm going to dip my morphe 433 eyeshadow brush in this completely I want it to be coded as does not have to be perfect this is just more so so the glitter has something to be on top of now what I really like about these eyeshadows is if you wet them which i'm going to take this mac fix+ the shadows go on really crazy metallic and I was going to tuck that in my lid now i'm noticing that there's some fallout so to save myself from screaming later let's apply some Chanel loose powder under my eyes to catch that ball out which we will brush out later this part is not have to be perfect now if you've never baked before just type in baking makeup and you'll find a million things all right we're going to buff that out in a minute after i'm done with my eyes and will make all this bull and seamlessly all right now let's go back with the dance big purple eyeshadow and lets blend it out now i'm going to take this all the way in to my socket and drag it down just a tiny their bold on a look at that shine now that the purple is laid down i'm going to be taking another mac - 24 and I'm going to dip into that purple really lightly knock off the fall out and i'm going to go in and just start blending the purple up a little bit still looks a little softer and not so harsh nothing crazy just soft blend and you want to keep it harsh in here so I'm not gonna buff that out too much all right now I'm going to take the mac 135 brush and I'm just going to dust off that fallout with powder I found this old graftobian makeup liquids park alert now this literally is like liquid glitter it doesn't show up opaque enough for me but it's definitely a good base and i'm just going to take this and paint it oh hi sparkles over my lid now before it dries i'm going to take a sigma e 5 7 flat brush and I'm just going to take some of this glitter and press it onto the brush I'm just going to press some on the lid oh wow hi I look like a party favor and i'm just going to type this in mice thought game it looks like a unicorn just threw up on my I ok because I'm glitter obsessed I'm going to bring it down a little bit on that purple there we go all right now I want my eyes to look extra dramatic today i'm going to be using the mac fascinating white eye pencil and i'm going to just put this on my waterline before i do any more litter shadows because I want my eyes - oh alright i really want more glitter on my eyes and I'm going to be layering a pigment down below I found this color pop eyeshadow it's called a visa it's like turquoise glitter would be going in with this Tom Ford 14 eyeshadow brush and I'm just gonna chip in there lightly put it under that white color and right on that purple so they merge together see them kissing and making out right there and I was checking a Beauty Blender and I'm kind of softening the edges a little more all right now for the center of my lid I'm going to really coat it with glitter I'm gonna go back in with that graftobian glitter glam yeah and i'm going to leave some of the turquoise showing so we can have a little moment but i'm going to cover most of it I'm going to go in with this mac 3d glitter in lavender and go back with the same sigma brush now this is like a more refined version of that pic glitter we just used and I'm just gonna rest it on oh wow and then I'm going to slowly start dragging it a little down now you guys know I love to cry glitter that is my favorite thing to do so I'm this layering and packing on more and more glitter and just lightly dragging it down now of course these two sides do not have to match is no one cries perfectly if you do you're good actress Oh for mascara i'm going to go in with my new favorite benefit roller lash I have been hooked on this ever since I tried it now I always put on mascara before lashes some people don't I mean your real hair will never be as dark as this black mascara know sometimes for bottom i want them really thick and quick want to go in without rebel scandal I mascara just for the bottom I love the way it feels and it never gets on my makeup or transfers so I come through them all for lashes i wanted something really bold and really big so I found these flutter lashes and the style is called Camilla when I saw these i was like oh hi now I love to take that duo glue and I put it right on the lash line since i'm just doing this on myself and then I'm going to sit for a second wave it around one lash is down now you guys know I'm not about to the second one with out a little bit of assistance I made them will be doing my make up soon so act already all right let's get down to business it's time for the second latch now that the lashes are finally done it's time for my favorite part of the face highlighting this is the your skin new dare glowing gardens glowing pink so i'm going to be using a more be 5 10 brush you guys notice is my favorite for highlighting and right above my contour and just gonna buff some of the sin and I'm gonna take some actually right under the brow bone if you forget the Cupid's bow I'm going to come to that screen and slap you and really you got to do the nose extreme on this look because this is like sideboard uniform real missed today i'll be using my own the lower liquid lipstick and this is in shade weirdo I think my favorite part about watching

so be on the look I promised a lot more is coming now the final touches are the Urban Decay all nighter all right this complete the look we're done all right this is the final look I hope you like it i got a lot of requests to do something gothy and glam if you're too scared to try a black lipstick try something maybe a little lighter maybe a dark purple but try something a little different get out of your normal routine and maybe spice it up sometimes we get stuck in a red and we tend to do the same makeup looks for a long period of time so break it up try something new alter this version and hashtag jeffree star cosmetics or snapchat me any luck that you recreate i would love to see you guys do something fun and i will see you on the next one bye guys whats up guys its jeffree star and guess what I'm finally doing makeup tutorials how long the guy's been telling me to do these probably don't know 10 years look I'm gonna do for you guys today is a very signature jeffree star look I have been wearing bright blue shadow ever since I can remember and it's just one of my go-to colors a lot of people screaming run away from it I'm like give me the blue so today i wanted to do my little you know Jeffrey crying glitter back with extreme highlight really old eyes and give a little soft nude lip so hope you enjoy alright guys i'm going to be doing a crazy blue glitter had to see glam look today so it just start that I like to put eyeshadow right under my brow and bring it pull it all the way down my lid so with that I'm going to be using the busy art matte palette this is the 01 basic so great so I'm just going to take this really light color is the lightest one of the palette and i am going to pack that under my brow now when we get closer to the lid i'm going to be using the second lightest nude shade and then bringing it all the way down to basically my lash line so a lot of people like to use primers this is basically my primer and we're going to bring it all the way to tell the brow and a little past yeah now next step is I'm going to take this kat von d eyeshadow from her mettle crush collection this is called thunderstruck and i love the shade you can even use a highlighter I'm going to pack this on my eyes so with this Mac - 10 rush i'm going to pack on a lot of pigment and i'm just going to take this color and i'm going to start blending it in the corners of my eye and I'm going to bring it down like thirty percent for my eye so not in the middle but thirty percent you know i'm going to take this same color and bring it to the top case with any fallout it's going to lightly brushed away we have what i like to call the base of the look down now i'm just going to jump right into it and take this bright blue eyeshadow called after party from sugarpill i'm going to be blending out the blue with a really light blue from honest hacia called I see now for this look I'm going to be using a lot of different eye brushes we got a lot going on here so i will be starting with the morphe 441 brush and I'm going to be packing it on with this chanel rush number 19 and then i'm going to be blending it out a little bit with this Gucci brush the blending number 20 see what happens all right now i'm going to be taking a map 224 brush and I'm going to be blending the sugar pill blue with the honest top see i see both on my brush so I getting nice soft then now you may notice that I blow a lot of the brushes if I was doing someone elses makeup blowing is prohibited unless they're paying you extra but for real i would only blow on my brushes because they are mine and i can and it is to avoid a lot of fallout because i have all of this pretty foundation on so if you see me going that's exactly what i'm doing i am blowing cool now i'm going to take I see shadow by itself and just kind of these edges now i'm going to take this on the stops to get shadow in Star cobalt and I'm going to pack it on a little bit on my lid with some definition and we're just packing all right now we're going to go back to our blending brush take a little bit more of that light light blue bristles and we're just going to go over the dark - they all come together like besties there we go now before i do the under I'm a little bit more of that thunderstruck I shout out on top so we get a nice glow we blend lose now we're going to move under the eyes now i'm just taking that same more a blender and I didn't dip into the eye shadow again this is left over so there is minimal fallout and I'm just gonna start blending the blue into this white gold shadow I try to do is minimal of the cane and so there is not a lot of shadow falling all over you now before I do anything else i'm going to add some white liner into my waterline whenever I do bright colors I love to add white because it really makes it pop you looked very artificial if we will and very dull like this is max quite fascinating liner I'm just going to pull my skin down ever so gently and I'm going to pack this in now I love white liner i've been using it since the nineties it is just my go-to it opened the I writings very different it's a cool effect when you see me go back and forth a lot not because the product isn't good but i like to really pack it in there so it is on all day now to finish off the eyes i'm going to do some really dramatic lashes from one of my favorite brands letter this style is called intoxicating and they are big I love these lashes really transform your entire look I think now I'm going to coat my bottom and top lashes with mascara and my favorite is the better than sex by Too Faced i love the bristles they are perfect for my eyes now this application is not be perfect since we are going to cover them I just don't like when people put on lashes without any mascara and you can see there real human hair showing through or it's just not the same color our lashes will never be this black hence why there is mascara so let's coat views thoroughly all right now and I do lashes i like to take the strip off and of course i like to measure them to my eyes so not everyone has crazy big lids fit these lashes so I've already pre-trimmed mine a little bit with a little bit of nail scissors now since latex smells like a dirty vagina i like to use non latex glue from you up so this is the B conversion so we're going to make that tacky for a second now sometimes i like to start in the middle and let go so I cannot going to get up close and personal for a second these are Wow see the difference of an eyelash all right lashes are done right before highlight i'm going to do a little fix+ refreshing make sure my foundation is there now I've been developing my own highlighters they are coming out spring of 2016 so i have a new one now the pan is going to be a lot bigger than this but this is one of the shade it is called deep freeze and it is a baby blue my highlighters are very pigmented so it remember to not pack it on too crazy if it is a wild color so I'm just going to lightly dust in the pan and I'm going to be working it into the skin no how come no one's done a blue highlighter for I don't like a no but it was about time making some options here people i'm getting bored all right now I'm going to take a little bit of highlighter my mac 252 and I'm just gonna lightly little bit lightly meaning intense in my world now I'm going to add a little bit of highlighter right on my Cupid's bow and bring it down on my lip tiny bit so when I put on my lipstick that ruined now I love to cry glitter so i'm going to use lit cosmetics in Tinseltown for that fact now you don't need any and keep any glitter and hear anything I just use my trip that's it and I take it right under my eye where I would cry and i dab a little bit and then I just drag it down over the highlight all right now we're going to do lipstick and we are done since my eyes and cheeks are so dramatic I'm going to tone down the lip with using my own the lower liquid lipstick in shade celebrity skin this is a good everyday color i'm just going to write straight on well ah we are done alright guys that is that completed look I

going to Pat that on there and then I'm gonna go directly into the glitter oh this looks and i'm just going to press that on top where that glitter glue was i love this because it's like kind of silvery but then it has hints of gold in it so it really helps tie in this a look all right now we're going to do two types of mascara today for the top lashes before I put on any falsies work means

Nikki tutorials using this the other day and I was like thank god someone is talking about this because this brush is the life I know it's sold out a few times it is really big on Instagram so if you can get a hold of this get a hold of it now I was going to be dipping into my Kat Von D shade and light palette and I like to mix these two shades on the left BAM and height that is my fingernail and gouging out the pan who hates when you fuck up your pan we're going to be taking this side first very skinny and we're just going to be dipping into this once literally one there's a lot of pigment the closer you put the two lines together to create that shadow the more pinched your nose is going to be so i am going to really bring mine in it's crazy what makeup can do look at how crazy and big it looks on the end now because I haven't finished it come on illusions yes now we're going to take the fluffy side and this has no product on it and I'm just gonna blend and buff it out a little bit not being really soft with my pressure so it just looks effortless and then i'm going to start to drag it down a little this way and then I'm gonna take some darkness and learn that up on the nostrils come on nostrils how's your day and then with the damp Beauty Blender i'm just going to lightly go over those edges where they're a little more dark at the top all right now to make sure this nose days snatch I'm going to be dipping in with a little bit of cat cosmetics go i hit pan on this the other day I am upset so I definitely need a new one this is a invisible setting powder and i love it really good to stay under the eyes if you have any problems with creasing the nose is set now to recreate that extreme highlight from that drug store look I'm going to be pulling out my sleek makeup now to this brand it is so good these highlighters are extreme i use this in my rolls-royce video as well and everyone was like do invention blinding us a on Aon do so I'm never taking my morphe m510 or the 510 as we call it on the streets for this one this is the one you guys I'm going to be taking of this shade this shade of this palette has three patterns and one cream and when I talked about before I said the wrong thing oops i'm clocking myself so these two I love mixing so I'm just going to start out by mm that's all you need you guys because this is dead Lee now i'm just going to take us on the high plains of my cheekbones and I'm not going to bring it down as low as i normally do because i want to look really high and elevated like a lavender glasses on my cheeks all right now it's time for the Cupid's bow so let's just dust on there I like to look like I was drinking a glass of silver surfers come so I'm just gonna you know really intensify that lip and because i'm not going to my lipstick for a minute was gonna just someone here because my bottom lip is like now the nose was really important so I'm just going to take one little finger swipe that's all you need and it was gonna rub it on the end and we're just gonna dust that and and go so it's like really really really extreme now sometimes I'll go back in with that you know it's contour just kind of clean up a little bit nach gods now let's go on to these eyes for the highlight under the brow all the way to the lid color we're gonna be dipping into my particular palette now this sold out so quickly when it launched a few weeks ago I was like jesus take the wheel so now my site is officially restock so if you want to dip into this madness all summer long give it a try i'm gonna be using this amazing like bone ivory color this is called China white and i'm just using a little flat synthetic brush let's go to blending now if you get that really dark smoky eye is actually way easier than you think i'm just going to be using this mac paint pot this is from the pro collection it's called black ground it is really dope so basically just going to coat my entire lives with this and then you shadow to buff and blend and make it really smoky so it's really not hard and its really don't fall out with this which is amazing so I'm gonna be using this ocean l blender synthetic brush and we're just going to dip right in hi it works quickly now it depends on where you want it i like to have mine all the way and then we'll put some highlight on the outside so i'm just going to start by coating my entire lid now this has so much pigment and this brush is just going to help me get it blend it out a little bit so i am going to stop it right here and then I'm gonna drag it down and i'll probably keep it just like that and then you gotta drag it in and of course we'll use a lot more big man let me dip into my pot and that's it you're just going to coat all the way over now of course if you don't like it all the way in the inner corner you can scale it back this is just what I prefer and then I'd like to drag it out this way and that's it now this part does not look pretty so you're like a hook in

this one and love it really easy to blend now i'm going to do a black winged liner today but before I do that I'm going to add some soft camel eyeshadow below just to give it that really dramatic look i'm gonna be using this bobby brown eyeshadow and the shape is called camel this is the morphe 514 i have about 16 of these on my makeup station my eyes are deep set I'm gonna be taking the shadow and almost bringing it down to where the contour my nose is and over my lid and slightly out so it will match the black winged liner and about to do and just going to drag it out for the brow and and we would do that later all right now that the other side matches perfectly I'm going to go in with him actually for blending brush and I'm going to take the same Bobby around I shout out and just start popping it up and outwards now i'm gonna be really delicate so this looks really soft all right now to soften those edges on the top i'm gonna go back in with that light shade and just start blending and blending just so they look really nice and smooth and not too harsh I'm going to take some shadow and put it more method can carve out that Brown all right look at our wing all right now for the black-winged i'm gonna be using the Kat Von D tattoo liner in trooper and i'm going to be using that chart black clay liner I love the stuff that you do not come off so i'm going to do the base with this and then fill in with the chart now when I do like to hold my breath so the line is precise so let's have a moment of silence for the liner yeah now that I got my shape down i'm going to be using this mac 263 brush to filling threat to my liner now if you want to your whole I with the letter you can i love you use gel liners because it really make sure the wing is not robot for him off later

it out just halfway so I'm never gonna go past it i'm just going to stop here and feather out and then a quick little trick I like to do with the nose is all just take a big fan brush this was from

some color all right i am feeling leaky now off camera i'm going to go draw in some browsers really quickly and i'll be right back all right now let's get started on these eyes to create that copper smoky drama i'm going to be using my Urban Decay eye primer and I'm just gonna do low one to swipe now notice I did do a different color on my eyebrows today it's a little more auburn color matches the pink and I might be blonder than this video but for now I love I'm just loving the brows I was taking a little flat synthetic brush and we are going to blend that primer into the lids now to start I'm going to be dipping into my own brands palette this is the beauty killer eyeshadow palette and I'm going to be using you two shades today first one I'm going to be using is China white and I'm going to take the same brush and I was gonna do my brow bone and highlight that now this is a very natural light ivory color so I'm just going to press that into the skin and then dragged down this is going to help my shadows blend later and just gives a pretty little highlight now we're going to take a little mac 224 brush and we're going to dip into a little transition shade called Kourtney and we're just going to put that right in our crease all right now notice how i am just kind of dragging this out a little bit right here just to give that I little illusion so now that this is done being blended we are going to add a little darkness in here with some copper shades now before I do anything else I'm going to go back into Kourtney and just do a little on my lids and there we go now to create that really dark copper moment i'm going to be using on stocks at beverly hills CNN oh come on first of all the pigments amazing so I'm really gonna darken my lid and start to blend that color out now everyone wanted to know what I was wearing on my lids the other day for that really wet metallic look so before we dive into that i am going to leave a space right in here to put that where I really don't need to put eyeshadow and then for a little touch of little more copper - I mean we need more warped to this space we're going to be using Anasazi as a blazing eyeshadow as well it's a little more rather than sienna and I'm just gonna put that in here as well we're just mixing matching today people now that this is blended into perfection of using the steel and magnificent metals now this is what gets that wet effect on your lids and this is shade king now it comes with these little dropper things you could mix to make it like a really crazy I'm going to be really country and to show you what I do yes I just like my own brush because i am putting it on myself do not ever like a brush and then put on our clients eyes but if you're doing on yourself who the fuck cares so I'm just going to take a little bit of this on the bridge soul you see how what'd that looks using this dry it's all right wedding a tiny bit I mean do you fucking say that whoa this is the definition of bullying bullying so the product is a little tacky you do have to move it around with the brush and then I'm just going to drag it down and fill in that blank space that we talked about earlier that we did not need any shadow for and then we're going to take a little bit more and here as well start to kind of get it out and there you have it come on now now they have these in like like 30 shades just like looking at on my lid i want to scream i am going to add a tiny bit of a liner now usually when i say tiny I do full fucking drag not today to face has these new eyeliner pens out called sketch markers and and i'm going to use this brown one this is called deep espresso this is like a brown black like this cute little packaging I love it's like now this is one of the felt tips and you do need to shake it for a second there are 1 million colors which I thought was amazing know what is this a inspired by Japanese calligraphy pens flexible felt tip allows you to create a paintbrush like stroke for clean mines all right well I'm just gonna dive right in here and just drag it on the lash line so our lashes look very pretty later I'm going to do the tiniest little wing and shock you all all right now to smoke out that bottom lash line and get that really deep copper fact i'm going to start out with my Mac some older I pencil and we're just going to quickly do the entire water line now we're going to smoke out that bottom lash line and he's on it stops at beverly hills shadow in henna now this one is like a deep copper and it has a lot of bling to it so I'm gonna actually use the liner to help me deep in and kind of create a more smoky look and I was going to start here with the pencil brush and just lightly really lightly almost like we're doing surgery go under the black liner now to avoid any fallout you're just going to be really gentle and go all the way across now I like to take the brush and kind of drag some of that black liner down and just kind of mix it in i love how this is looking I'm just gonna deep in this a little more make it a little more pop in and we should be good now i just bought this new Gucci mascara I'll keep this packaging is I'm like hey there now this is the iconic black mascara I've never tried this before really cute packaging and who the wand is Q so I'm just gonna go in here and see what happens for lashes today i'm going to be using the house of laches iconic these are so gorgeous so I'm going to slap them on and I'll be right back lashes are done now let's get to highlighting what are we gonna do you need for

this one all the time in a more 5510 a few swipes is all you need so I'm just going to take this and hm whoo put this on the high plains of my cheekbones now this highlighter does have a little peach huge weight which looks really great with all this warm tone makeup I have going on today so we're just gonna use my skin we can do a little up here whoo the glow though what that would be right

and we'll see you on the next one bye guys hey guys so today's video is another Valentine's Day tutorial I said that I would be posting like two more this is the second look I came up with and i'm using the very obvious naked 3 palette i know there's tons of Valentine's Day tutorials with this palette but a bunch of you requested that I do a Valentine's they look with the palette so that's what I did and this is what i came up with I only used one other eye shadow that wasn't in this palette but it's a purple and you can find her body we're actually really like this look because it is really really simple it's a nice light pink blush like pink lips and like a pinky purple I and I just think it's nice and sweet and soft and romantic so for those of you who like that soft and romantic look this one is perfect for you so let me know down below if you like this to run if you want to see how to get this look then just keep on you I'm going to start by priming my eyelids with Too Faced shadow insurance then I'm going to take the color limit and the naked 3 palette and this is going to be my transition color and taking it on a fluffy brush and I'm just probably going to put this all over my crease some of my eye as well then I'm taking the color buzz in the palette and i am going to apply this all over my lid with a flat shader brush the pigmentation on this eyeshadow isn't the best as you can probably tell so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a little bit of a fix plus and spray that on my brush and then give it back into the eyeshadow and apply it like that yeah then I'm going to take nooner and on my - 17 I'm just gonna quickly blend the harsh edge of that eye shadow now i'm going to take my wet and wild last palette this is the other i'm sure i'm using for this tutorial but you can use any matte purple this is a duper max fake one if you have the eyeshadow then use that one but I'm just going to take my mac 217 and i'm going to start applying this eyeshadow on the outer view of my eye and then drag it up into the crease yeah now i'm going to take limit which is the first shadow we used and do the exact same thing i'm going to just blend this into my crease so that everything blends nicely and really quickly i'm just going to tight line and line my waterline with the Maybelline master drama eyeliner I'm going to take this bottle angled brush from hell and i'm going to dip it into max carbon and i'm going to start creating a line and I didn't want to use gel or liquid liner because I didn't want it to be too harsh I wanted to be really really soft next I'm taking black heart from the palette and I'm going to start stamping this on the outer V of my eye and then dragging it in so it fades nicely I just want to add a little bit of definition to the outer wheel my eye yeah yeah yeah yeah for my highlight am taking strange and i'm applying this underneath my problem and in my energy . I'm gonna go back into that buzz color with some more fix+ and apply it right in the center of my lid to give it that metallic pop then I'm just going to add some mascara and i'm going to move on to

bronzy warm colors like this all the time i am using the original naked palette which you guys know is my absolute favorite palette i do this look so so often and I never wanted to do a tutorial on it because I feel like there's so many tutorials that look just like this with the naked palette but it was so highly requested that I decided to go ahead and film it plus i think the pop of blue is just so beautiful i think this is such a beautiful night time summary look or you can wear it in the daytime because i am right now I don't care i'm just really obsessed with this look as well I think it's

primed my eyes with Urban Decay primer potion but now i'm going in with the maybelline color tattoo in caramel cool and i'm going to apply this all over my lid and up to my crease as well the problem using is the urban decay naked palette and I'm going to take the color book which is the darker one out of the two matte shades and this is going to be my crease color so I'm just going back and forth into that book eyeshadow because I want my crease to be very pigmented I wanted to look like the color is going up pretty high past my crease so I'm just taking my time and blending this out adding more and more eye shadow little by little yeah next I'm going in with my favorite color in this palette and it is called smog and on a regular flat shader brush I'm going to apply this all over my lid up to my crease yeah I'm just gonna take the color right here is called half baked it's a beautiful beautiful gold color and i'm going to apply it right to the center of my lid it's going to give it like a really pretty pop of gold yeah I'm just taking smog again and i'm going to apply it to the very outside of my crease and the very inner part of my eye as well just know that the gold can really stand out now i'm just going to line my tight line i'm not going to line my waterline but just might I line with this Maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master and then I'm going to take the color virgin and this is gonna be my inner corner highlight and my brow bone highlight as well yeah now i'm just gonna go in with falsies i am using my ardell demi wispies and I am NOT adding gel eyeliner or liquid eyeliner so I want to make sure i get it as close to my lashes as possible here i'm just adding some more buck just keeping out the crease yeah moving on to my face i am going to prime with my L'Oreal miracle blur not so much prime but try to cover up some of my pores I'm just adding this to the places where I think I needed this stuff is just way too thick to put on my entire face but it does work well and in certain spots on my pain the foundation i'm going to be using is my revlon colorstay this is for normal to dry skin this is in the shade 250 fresh page the foundation i wear when I have a little bit of a tan like today and i'm going to apply this with my real techniques yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah for concealer i'm going to mix my boo cover up concealer and my Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade 15 light and I'm going to mix them both and apply it underneath my eyes yeah i'm also going to drag it down to get a triangle shape to highlight as well I want underneath my eyes to be really nice and bright for this look so that's why I'm doing that I'm going to first blend it out with my fingers and then blend it out with my Real Techniques contour brush yeah yeah next I'm going to take my Maybelline fit me powder in 135 creamy natural and i'm going to use to set the under eye concealer really quickly to finish up underneath my eyes I'm taking my Urban Decay eyeliner in main line and is a beautiful match teal color i absolutely love this eyeliner and i'm going to run that on my waterline and then I'm going to take max limit i shadow plumage plumage plumage pretty sure its plumage and on a tiny little brush I'm going to run that really really close to my waterline just a smudge out the eyeliner a little bit then with a clean pencil brush

of my forehead and on my cheekbones just the place we're always on tour yeah I don't really like to do a super harsh contour anything like that i never do but just enough to where it shows all my cheekbones just a little bit you don't have to contour just rounding up your face would still look really nice with this look I'm going to take my Maybelline master highlight highlighting blush and nude and i'm just going to add this to my cheeks I'm gonna do like a light wash just so i can give me a little bit of a glow my lipstick i am using my revlon soft nude lipstick and then that completes makeup look thank you guys so much for watching and for requesting this look please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on juno gambler wow this is using at the urban decay naked smoky palette or Medicaid was nice enough to send it to me before it was released and I am pretty sure today i'm posting this on the day that you can buy this so it should be already available to purchase on urban decay . com I know that on an altar . comic comes out in a few days but you can buy at Urban Decay today this video is not sponsored by the way i'm just posting it on the day it's gonna be released really quick let me just give you like a mini review i love it i love the packaging I love the packaging still to this day my favorite packaging is the original naked palette I know that everybody hates that packaging but I love it and I despise the packaging on the Naked 2 m3 and then when this one came out I was so excited because it's like a magnet it's not like a 10 that closes so I'm so glad that they change the packaging and honestly when I saw this for the first time I was like wow this is exactly what i wanted the naked2 to be I love the first one it's my it's 14 pallets of all time and the third one is beautiful it's nice and rosy and then this one is what i wanted the second one to be like a smoky version I'm so happy they came out with this i think it's worth it even if you have the first one because it's different it's deeper it's more cool tone it's just start it smoky but this is the look i came up with I really love it for like a night out clubbing or something i really like it so if you want to get this local then just keep watching ok so the first thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids with Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer I've been really liking this lately then I'm going to take the eyeshadow called combust this color is really close to my skin tone only a little bit more pinky so I'm just using this to set the eyeshadow primer because that primer is a little tacky I'm going into this white ish shade which i think is called 13 and i'm using this underneath my brow bone to really highlight and lift the brow and in my inner corners even though i'm going in with a different color later i'm going to take this milani milani milani shadow eyes and black and i'm using this as a base so I'm applying this to my entire lid and then I'm gonna kind of like you know move it around and try to blend it with just a regular eyeshadow brush I'm sick by the way my sound at that's why I'm gonna take this eyeshadow called armor I love this color because it has a ton of glitter but the glitter actually shows up like it's pigment enough to wear it it shows up I don't know it's really really really pretty i'm applying this to my entire lid i just love how it looks with a black base underneath that makes it deeper and I'm taking password i'm going to start blending this into my crease because we put a black bass down like a harsh line kind of created on my so I'm just going back and forth with the eyeshadow password taking my time and really trying to blend those two eyeshadows together it's going to take some time but you just have to double and 11 I'm going right back into combust with a fluffy brush with no product with like no previous product just come bus and I'm blending everything taking the purple in the palace it's a good dark dark purple I think it's called remember but i'm just using this on the outer V of my eye it doesn't give too much step but just enough like I just want the outer corners to be just a little bit deeper and I'm dragging some of that into the crease just to help blend some more I decided this look would look really pretty with a wing a big wing a Smalling it doesn't really matter but i'm just adding a small little wing I want the eyeshadows to really stand out so I don't want to go too heavy with my wing now i'm just applying a ton of roller lash mascara to my bottom lashes and i'll finish the rest of my eyes when i'm done with my face ok so i decided to use this for the first time this is from lush cosmetics and it's called the skin tint feeling feeling younger skin tint gives your face like such luminosity it's very similar to the L'Oreal magic Lumi primer so yeah I put that on my face is like a nice moisturizing luminizing stuff then i went in with the LC foundation and I am in the shade sand I believe so yeah that's what I'm going on my face I actually really like this formation it is matt and it can be a little heavy but with a light layer it's actually really really pretty and it looks nice and Matt and really pretty I like it I dig it now i'm taking the urban decay naked skin concealer and the maybelline fit me concealer mixing both of them together just to get like a perfect color and then i will be blending that out as a huge i'm also highlighting with the fit me with my of course trustee to release - 17 I feel like I talk about this all the time but i love it was sent to me by a subscriber not even by the companies and don't always has no idea who the heck I am but thank you so much because they freakin look now i'm going to set that with a the wave a brush and I'm dipping the brush into the Kat Von D shade and light palette and I'm using the yellow shade to set my concealer and I'm gonna finish off the eyes I'm using the next check Charlie I can say black gel eyeliner and then i'm going to go in with slate I've no password this is password and with a pencil brush I am rubbing that in my lower lash line to smoke out the black eyeliner and then I wanted it to be just a little darker so I'm taking that color right there and just further some no get out i'm applying some roller lash mascara to my bottom lashes and minimal problems and policies and the falls i use or the posh with lashes and i'm going to go into hi this is the first pallet I mean the first shadow on the palate and actually what the eyeshadow with a little bit fix+ so it can be super intense and that's what I applied to my inner corners now I'm just going to contour using the Kat Von D shade light palette i'm using the more cool tone color and an angled brush to add some content to my cheekbones like my voice is going away so like I'm going to go cold this sucks now i'm going to take the warmer shade in the palette because when I have a tan too much in I don't like my contour to be too ashy I'm just adding a little bit of warmth the blush I'm using is tarts captivating then for highlight I'm using this to analyse duo so don't lace what the heck the Sonia Kashuk duo that has like a bronze and highlights i'm using the pinky highlight from a highly it's super intense and super beautiful i highly recommend this you can get at target then I'm going to take the Loreal lalak lippy thingy and charcoal black and I'm applying this to my entire lips this is already glossy it's like a lacquer finish but i wanted to add some more gossip I'm taking the show for a perfect nude lip gloss and i'm applying that on top so that completes this look I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial this is the look I was wearing in my only unboxing and a bunch of you guys said you wanted a tutorial on it i didn't use the cosmetics naturally pretty palette to achieve this look but honestly i only use two eyeshadows in the entire pallet this look is mainly focused around really thick eyeliner and really big voluminous fake lashes so basically anybody can achieve this look as long as you have eyeliner and fake lashes you're good to go as long as you use two colors that are similar to the ones that I used in this tutorial this tutorial was kind of an epic fail this eyeliner came out super wonky and it was just so frustrating and I wasn't going to take off all my makeup just put it back on so I mean it looks a little wonky forgive me but yeah I really want to get back into filming makeup tutorials more often used to do them all the time but i'm going to get back into filming a lot more for you guys so leave a comment down below if there's a palette i have that you want to tour on or anything like that and i will film those for you if you want to see how to get this really thick eyeliner thick lashes look what is this i don't know just keep watching so I'm going to do things a little bit different in this video I'm starting off with my face that usually start off with my eyes but I am taking the Baum's tinted moisturizer called bomb shelter and i'm going to be using my makeup geek foundation stippling brush to apply it this tinted moisturizer is a little bit weird when I first apply you don't really see much color coming off but as they both fit into my skin it oxidizes which is ok for me because it oxidizes immediately and it matches my neck and the rest of my body so good and I'm speeding through this clip because it would take way too long for you to sit there and see the whole process I put two layers on my face just to get more coverage and it sent invoice riser so it doesn't get kinky at all i love this tinted moisturizer love the finish it's my fav next I'm gonna take my booboo cover up concealer and I'm going to be applying this underneath my eyes in a triangle shape just to highlight and cover up my dark circles of course yeah yeah yeah i'm using this elf foundation brush just to blend everything else yeah now i'm taking my Too Faced shadow insurance and i'm going to prime my eyelids yeah and then because i have a lot of veins on my eyes I'm just gonna take that same boo cover up concealer and add this to my whole eyelid just so it's a nice even canvas and there are no veins poking through or anything like that yeah next I'm taking my mac emphasize powder and with my Real Techniques contour brush i'm just going to set the concealer and i'm also going to bring this onto my eyelids because this Potter has a really pretty rude essence to it I don't know how to explain it just looks really really nice and glowy so I like to bring it on my eyelids as well especially for this look I just think it looks nice now i'm taking my it cosmetics naturally pretty palette and I'm gonna take this shade right here called transforming pearl and i'm going to use this to highlight underneath my brow bone next I'm taking this shade called mocha and i'm going to take my mac 217 and start adding this to the outer V of my eye and then slowly bring it into the crease I just go back and forth with this eyeshadow adding a little by little yeah i'm also creating like a triangle with the same eyeshadow just flicking my brush outwards like that so it looks like a nice little sharp triangle shape on the outer beef if you know what I'm saying hey I just go back and forth with the eyeshadow and build it up a little by little now i'm going to take this transforming pearl shade again and I'm going to add some to the inner parts of my eye just to make it look nice and glowy and then this is gonna be my inner corner highlight as well now i'm going to line my tight line and my waterline with Maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master and then I'm going to be adding some falsies with this look these are from house of lashes and they're in the style called true romance and I cannot put on false lashes on camera to save my life it takes forever so i just did that off-camera and now i'm taking my Maybelline line stiletto liquid liner and i'm just adding a really really thick eyeliner on top i'm going to go back into that palette and take the shade mocha and i'm just going to deepen out my crease with this and my outer V just a little bit more and I'm gonna take that same eyeshadow and run it underneath my lashes just to smoke it out a little bit and then I'm going to add mascara moving on to the rest of my face i am taking my bahama mama bronzer by the bomb and i'm going to be using a sigma highlighting brush just to contour my face yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and i'm taking my pixie bronzer and suddenly son touched i use this as a blush because it is a little bit pink and i'm going to add this to my cheeks and I'm gonna finish off this look with lipstick this is quite be realistic in the shade musk and i'm going to apply this to my lips and then I'm going to add my NYX butter gloss in fortune cookie right on top this is a very very pale nude but i like to add it to dr. lipsticks just to make them a little bit lighter and that is the finished look I hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video so i found a tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right now it is using the Urban Decay Naked 2 palette and I really wanted to film this kind of tutorial because i usually wear like browns and golds as opposed to blacks and sellers so I kind of wanted to branch out and do something different and I rarely use my naked 2 palette since it's a little bit more cool tone so I wanted to bring this puppy out and do something for the cool tone lovers out there and I'm actually really liking how it turned out I don't know I just I really really love it if you want to see how I got this look then just keep on watching ok so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to prime my eyelids with Mac's painterly Paint Pot for that really sharp cat eye look like they're really sharp edges I'm going to take some tape and put it on the back of my hand a few times just so that it doesn't pull at the skin around my eyes now i'm going in with Urban Decay's Naked 2 palette and I'm going to be taking the color tease and with the sigma e40 i am going to work that into my crease I'm just going to be using this as a transition color so all the other colors blend nicely next I'm going in with the color pistol which is this color right here and I'm taking it on a mac 239 brush and I'm going to pack this color on my entire lid ok ok so because i want this color to really stand out I'm going to take max fix+ and spray that on my brush and adding 6 plus to any eyeshadow really intensifies the color a lot so I'm just going to pack this on my lid again yeah so you can really see what a difference the fixed plus makes on the eye shadow yeah now i'm going in with the color black out and i'm just going to work this on the outer part of my eye and a little bit in the crease this part takes a lot of time it's just really going back and forth with that same color and just working it in lightly because blackout is a very very pigmented black eyeshadow so going back in forth and adding that shadow little by little kind of helps you blend it out a lot more as opposed to just dipping your brush into the eye shadow and putting it on your I are gonna have like a big black spot because it's so pigmented so just take your time with it and go back and forth and just work it into the crease and into the outer corners as well ok now I'm going to take this brush right here it's from coastal sense it's just an eyeshadow brush but it's really soft so I like using it for this and i'm just going to be dipping it back into that same blackout color and really packing on the color on the outer corners and blending it towards the center of my eye so this part is just really a lot a lot of blending you just want to take the color and mostly focusing on the outer part of your I like where the tape meets the eye shadow and just blend it towards the center like I said it's just a lot of blending just pack the color out on the outer corner and start blending it in this part is completely up to you if you want it really really intense black on the outer corners or if you don't want it so intense so whatever is comfortable for you yeah ok now i'm taking the color foxy and i'm adding this as my highlight under my brow bone this color fox is pretty much the color of my skin so I'm going to be taking a little bit of booty call it took very shimmery so I'm only taking a little bit of it and adding it to like the high . underneath my eyebrow like underneath the arch now i'm taking my favorite eyeliner it is the Maybelline master drama eyeliner and i'm going to tight line with this and also be adding this to my waterline ok now for the liquid liner i'm using my Maybelline mine stiletto and just adding some liquid liner ok I really want the liquid liner to be as mad as possible and the lines the little can kind of leave it a little bit glossy so I'm going to take black out and just kind of set the liquid liner with the black eyeshadow and it makes it look very matte which is what I want now i'm just taking off the tape and you have this perfectly straight sharp cat I kind of look I love it and I'm just taking my little makeup remover and kind of like cleaning around any fallout yada yada you know you know ok and here i'm just doing the face makeup I didn't really go into detail with this I i always do so I wanted to keep it short for this video but of course i will be listing all the things i used on my face on in the description box but i'm just using some foundation and concealer not stuff I just really wanted to my foundation on before I finished my eyes because i am not done with my makeup if you're wondering see back to the ice ok i added two more eyeliner by the way because i felt like it had kind of faded ok so anyway I'm taking the brush that came with the naked 2 palette and I'm taking the color verb which is a very light shimmery silver and I'm going to pack this on the inner part of my eye so I want my I to go from like a light silver to a dark silver to black so I am packing on the inner part of my eye and I'm also putting this in my to deck area as my highlight yeah ok so now i'm taking a pencil brush and I'm doing it in to that same verb color and I'm going to put this all over my lower lash line I personally think it looks nice and kind of brightens up the lower lash line even though i have like really intense black eyeliner I don't know I just think you kind of brightens up the look a little bit and i personally think it looks nice but I mean if you want to go darker on the lower lash line you totally can and it would still look really really nice it is up to you so now i'm just going to take my clinic clash doubling mascara and add mascara to my top and bottom lashes and voila these are the finished eyes ok so i already did the rest of my face makeup just ate some time I don't want this video to be too long but I contoured with my ELF contouring blush and bronzing powder thing just concert with the bronzer and for my blush i use the NYX blush and mom i have been loving this you guys know that if you saw my favorites video it's just like my favorite blush with the moment and I highlighted with an eyeshadow in my ceiling in the light palette i highlighted with kin just like that highlight I have going on here i have been loving to highlight my cheeks with this kid eyeshadow it's beautiful yeah hello anyway I still need to put on some lipstick I'm first going to take people glam gaga from Mac - all busted and gross so I'm going to take it on well the first like this I'm putting it on very very lightly I don't want it to be like bubblegum pink just like a light wash of a baby pink color and then on top of that i am taking my NYX butter gloss and creme brulee I have been obsessed with this it's beautiful so that's what I'm going to layer on top ok guys so that is the finished look I really hope you like this tutorial and I hope you try it out on yourself thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys todays video is a one brand tutorial on this look right here my last one brand tutorial was a full face elf makeup look and I got pretty positive feedback so i want to do these more often so today i am using all make up for ever products my next one brand tutorial will be drug store so I want to do like one drug store one high end and then alternate them back and forth so today at high-end since my last one was drug store and if you want to see how to get this look then just keep on watching I'm going to start by priming my face with the step 1 equalizer this is the hydrating one this one is probably my favorite one just because i do have dry skin and i love how it fits underneath my makeup then I'm going to take my holy grail foundation not just because it's Make Up For Ever it's literally my favorite foundation you guys know this if you saw my foundation video this is the face and body foundation it's waterproof at last such a long time it's a very sheer coverage but I find that it does even out my skin tone and because the coverage is kind of sheer i do have to build it up and work with it so that's why I'm fast-forwarding this part because if not we will be here for a good two minutes but i'm just applying that with a flat top student at least brush and now i'm making this face because when I wanted to film this video I realized it didn't have a concealer by make up for ever's I ran to the store and i purchased one on sephora this is the waterproof full-coverage concealer i have mine in the shade number four honestly this stuff is amazing but I think it would be better for blemishes because for underneath the eyes even though it has great coverage it's a little tacky and it's a little thick so it does crease I mean it worked perfectly fine for me and it lasted for the rest of the day but you do have to set it immediately because if not it will create because of the Agnes but hey I can't complain i'm like it so because i don't have a make up for ever setting powder I am just get a little creative here and i am using a artists eye shadow in the shape and 500 which is like a vanilla creamy matte shade so it's set my concealer perfectly by the way i also put that concealer on my eyelid to act as a primer so i decided to go ahead and do the rest of my face first I never do that but that's what i'm doing and i'm going to use this pro bronze fusion bronzer I believe that's what it's called and i'm pretty sure this one is in the shape 20 mm it's my favorite one because it has the coolest undertone the other ones are a lot more warm the other ones are amazing too but this one is perfect for contouring so I am contouring my face using a morphe brush from their elite collection you do have to build these bronzers up but they apply perfectly it's not powdery at all it's one of the best bronzer formulations i have ever seen and then i decided i wanted a little bit more contoured - like that brush with a little bit too fat so I picked up with the makeup geek chiseled face brush it's one of our new brushes and it gives you that very chiseled contour look and feel in it I like this brush so far so for blush I'm using this cream brush cream brush while no cream at blush it's a vibrant but oh my gosh I cannot be today is a vibrant pink but i like it with this makeup look and it's not too intense i'm applying it with a real techniques setting brush I believe this is in the shade - 10 or 220 but i will have everything down below hey i'm just applying a very soft layer I don't want too much you know now taking the pro sculpting duo in 01 first time taking a stippling brush and applying it into the bronzer just to warm up my face a little bit because I didn't want to add just a little bit of warm you know since the bronzer was a little bit more on the cool side then I'm dipping myself for a fan brush into with the highlight shade which is the stoner of this little duo it's a nice frosty pinky pearly shading it really love it so that is my highlight and then I'm just gonna go ahead and jump into the eyes so I'm using all of the Makeup Forever artists eye shadows today and the first I should i am using is M 548 and i'm using this on a more feed crease brush to just apply into my crease you know the drill my transition shade and now my favorite it's probably I'm not gonna lie my favorite make up for ever eyeshadow ever it's such a pretty like eggplant purple and this one is m 9 28 and I'm applying this with an out brush on my entire I and i am working in sections like i'm applying it little by little because I wanted that full on color so I'm just packing it on and taking my time then on a smaller crease brush with like no additional product I'm just blending out any harsh lines that like the purple created then I want to take one of my other favorites from the artists eye shadow line and i believe it's called pinky brown on sephora but it's a really pretty piggy brown yes the numbering is M 500 and 600 yes m600 and i'm using this in my crease with a mac 217 just to blow it out and then I'm going right back into the purple and just intensifying it because once you start of blending other colors in the crease the lid shade kind of disappears a little bit so as you can see i'm going back and forth with those two colors just to intensify everything and then I'm taking that same vanilla shade i use to set my concealer and i'm using that as a brow bone highlight and then I'm taking something a little bit shimmery ER because everything is so mad I wanted the problem just have a little bit of shimmer and I used I for one for for that now in a pencil brush i'm applying this to my lower lash line and then I remembered oh I wanted to put eyeliner and i forgot to do that well this is a Make Up For Ever eyeliner in brown and i'm just applying that on my waterline and then I'm going right back to doing what I was doing earlier so this is like a more feed pencil brush and i just applied that purple all across my lower lash line then taking a bigger pencil brush and dipping into pinky brown and just look in that out so for liner i am using this graphic liner actually bought this with the Christian Grey or like 50 shades of grey collection i bought like during christmas and now is when I'm getting around to using it is so black so i just applied my typical like small little wing and then i'm going to load on the mascara this is the smoky lash mascara no smokey extravagant mascara and then i am using that same shade i used under my brow bone the I for one for just to intensify my inner corners so we are almost done but now to do the lips I'm taking this lip liner in the shade 1c and I am lining my lips and then filling in my lips as well and then I wanted something a little bit more on the cool side like I wanted a cool tones lips i'm using this aqua rouge it's a liquid lipstick basically and this one is in the shade number one it's like a super gray cool tone liquid lipstick so I only . in some in the center and then blend it out with my finger just to make it a cool to lip but not like super grade so that completes the slick I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next hey guys so today's video is a tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing it is another naked 3 tutorial am i doing to any of these maybe but in my defense this was requested this is the look i am wearing in my previous video the very favorites video and a bunch of the guys said you wanted to see a tutorial on it so here I am what I like so much about this look is that it's literally so easy there's no wing no eyeliner nothing too dramatic it is a nice simple bronzy look and i love that because the naked 3 palette is full of nice rosy pinky color so you wouldn't think of doing a look so warm and chocolaty and bronzy but you can now obviously there are some rosy undertones and this look like you could definitely see the Pink's kind of popping through but that's because you know it's a prank palette but you've been wanting to do a nice bronzy look with the naked 3 I hope you enjoyed this one so if you want to see how to get this look just keep watching ok so to prime my eyes I'm using the Urban Decay primer potion then I'm going to be taking the Milani shadow lies in the shade golden bronze and i'm going to use this as a base for the eyeshadows i'm using and then I'm just going to blend that out with my finger keeping it below my crease so I'm going to take my naked 3 palette and I'm going to go into the shade nooner and i'm going to use this in my crease with a mac 217 just to blend out that base we just put down I'm going to build the color slowly and take it a little bit far past my crease then I'm going to go into the color trick and I'm going to use my mac fix+ just intensify this eyeshadow a little bit more and then i'm going to apply this all over my lid right up to the crease the next color I'm using it this one called factory and i'm using this one because it does have a lot of brown to it so it's really going to complement that gold color and i'm just going to take this on my - 17 and slightly blend it into my crease while putting it on my outer V as well i'm also going to be taking a smaller flat shader brush this one's from coastal sense and i'm just gonna be packing that same color onto my outer V and then bringing it into my crease and i'm using this brush to just get a little bit more precise than the 17 going back into my - 17 with no additional product I'm just going to blend everything into my crease now with a tiny little brush I'm going to take the color black heart and i'm just going to add this really close to my lashes but on the outer V of my eye so right in the middle i'm just going to drag it all the way to the end and this is going to make like an imaginary eyeliner look but it's not going to be as harsh then I'm just going to highlight with the color strange and i'm going to use that under my brow bone and in my tear duct as well for my mascara i am using the jordana best lash extreme I'm gonna go on to the rest of my face before I finish up underneath my eyes so I'm going to prime my face with the law real miracle blur and i'm only going to add this to places where i think i need it I'm not going to put this all over my face and said it's pretty thick yeah the foundation I'm using is the revlon colorstay what foundation in 250 medium beige and I'm going to use my real techniques sponge to apply it this is a pretty thick foundation so I like using a sponge to apply it and bends it out and gives it a little bit more of a dewy finish then I'm going to take my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser and i'm going to highlight my face and cover my dark circles yeah then I'm going to take my Real Techniques contour blush to blend all that out yeah to set that area underneath my eyes and using the fit me powder in 135 creamy natural underneath my eyes I'm going to take a tiny little brush and I'm going to dip it into the color factory and i'm just going to run this underneath my lashes I didn't use eyeliner or anything like that you can go ahead and do that if you want it to be a little bit more dramatic but i liked the way it looked without eyeliner and i'm going to take my little clinic bottom lash mascara and i'm going to apply this to my bottom lashes now i'm just going to bronze up my face a little bit and I'm going to use the NYC son and bronze in the shade Montauk bronze with my real techniques blush brush and I'm just gonna pretty much so this all over my face yeah for my blush i am using meet our amazonian clay blush in the color exposed with my it cosmetics blush brush I'm just going to highlight a little bit and I'm going to use the hard candy bronzer intiki and i'm just going to highlight my cheekbones down the bridge of my nose and a little bit above my lip for lipstick i'm using this extremely white lipstick from Maybelline called bear

in white russian and then that complete this makeup tutorial thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next one hey guys so today's video is another tutorial on these roles gold eyes it's very very fast and simple to daytime appropriate so the first thing I'm going to do is prime my eyelids and then I'm going to take the color limit and i'm going to buff this into my crease I'm going back and forth with this I really want this color to show up in my crease I have a cold like what I sound horrible now i'm taking this color here called trick and that is the really pretty rolls gold shade in the palette it's probably my dear I shadow but as you can see the pigmentation isn't the best so I'm just going to take some pics + wear that on my brush and then apply this to my lids and the fix plus really really intensify the eyeshadow and just makes it look like literally rose gold and it gives it like a nice Sheen to it i love how it looks with some fixed bless you can even use like I drop sir yeah then I'm taking the color nooner and then I'm just packing this on to my outer V and then I'm bringing this into the crease I want to be like nice and diffused and blown out that new new shade is so beautiful so I'm packing a lot of that into my crease then i'm taking the color factory and I'm going to put this underneath my lower lashes oh why my sig I hope I'm sorry that these are all voice overs but it's just I don't know then I'm going to take nooner that shade i used my crease and then blend out my lower lash line as well i'm thinking the lightest shade in the palette and this is going to be my brow bone highlight and my inner corner highlight then adding some morphic splash on my 6 plus on my brush I'm going to pack some of that trick color onto the inner part of my eye on the bottom lash line just to brighten it up a little bit then i'm just adding some mascara and that's pretty much it for the eyes and don't want to add eyeliner or winged liner anything like that since this is a daytime look and for my face I wanted to keep it very very very simple so honestly I just bronze my face a little bit using some physicians formula bronzer and that i didn't contour anything just warmed up my cheeks a little bit for my lips I'm using this Maybelline nude lipstick in blushing beige that I got recently and I swear it's like the most beautiful nude color in the world but i thought i was just like a little bit to New not to nude but i just wanted a little bit more pink so I took the Maybelline Color whisper and pedal rebel and I just add that on top just to give it a more pinky nude color and that's pretty much it like I said it was super quick thank you so much for watching guys and I'll see you in my next one bye ok so today's video is going to be a double tutorial i don't think i've ever done something like this but it's been so requested to continue to do tutorials using the Too Faced chocolate bar palette so i thought i would combine two in one this is the first look right here this would look really nice for spring it's just like a very dewy fresh look no liner no falsies it's something that's very very simple but it has like that pop of purple and it's just a little bit different than like a day to day look but it is perfect for daytime so if you want to see how to get look number one then just keep watching ok so i've already primed my eyelids and the first color I'm going in is with milk chocolate i'm using the beauty by Rosita brush and I'm just buffing this into my crease to create a nice little transition shade so all the colors can blend nicely on top I'm going into candied violet with a flat shader brush and I'm applying this to the outer corner of my eye and the inner corners of my i'm gonna leave the center of my lid blank because i'm going to go over it with another shadow by the way I'm losing my voice I don't know what it is yeah I don't know life I guess so i'm thinking candied violet like a very little amount of candy violet and I'm just buffing some of that into my crease so that it all flows together and I'm just intensifying you know that candied violets a moat now i'm going to go in with salted caramel i love this shadow it's probably my favorite in the palette and I'm just adding this to my crease to warm up the look a little bit and to just blend everything together now marzipan which is my other favorite in this palette and I'm applying this directly in the center of the lid wherever I didn't apply candy violet that's where i'm applying this and I'm just with the same brush just mixing them together so that they blend nicely into one another and then i just added some more salted caramel into my crease to highlight underneath my brow bone i took a white chocolate and then i'm going to go in with marzipan and i'm going to mix it with champagne truffle I'm gonna dip my brush into both of these shadows and i'm going to use that as my inner corner highlight yes ok now I'm going to take my room scandalize nude eyeliner and i'm going to apply this to my waterline I wanted a nude liner so that my eyes can look a little bit bigger and more fresh and then I took some candied violet and I applied it underneath my lashes and then I took salted caramel and bust it together I didn't show the shadows I don't know why but I just used candied violet and salted caramel and then i apply to some pico extra sculpt volume mascara and that completely eyes it was a very very simple I look I already have my foundation and my concealer and my powder on my face because I didn't want this video to be too long but i do want to show you really quickly the other products are used in my face so I'm just browsing up my skin with my Too Faced milk chocolate soleil bronzer i'm using the Knicks fan brush I believe that school is cold to highlight my face i'm going to take crushed pearls from the Anasazi aglow kit this is like the pinky er located I really really really love it it's amazing i'm just using crushed pearls to have first row yes to highlight tops of my cheekbones and my nose to get extra highlighting and glowy for blush i am taking the wet and wild ombre blush in the shade might I buy you a drink pretty sure that's the name of the blush it will be listed below it's a very sheer blush but it is really really pretty now i'm taking the econometrics waterproof nude lipliner this is called nude buff or buff nude and i'm filling in my entire lips with this I did overlined my lips I did it intentionally i wanted my life to look extra county and like bigger but don't do it if you don't like that I just you know want to change it up now i'm going in with the Makeup Forever plexiglass this is in the shade too old to this is a very thick but very glossy lip gloss so I want my lips to look glossy so that's what I did so that completes look number one very free daytime fresh I really love it if you want to see how to get look number two then let's jump right into that so I've already prime my lids and now i'm going in with milk chocolate on a fluffy blending brush and I'm just buffing this on the outer corners and then dragging it into my crease now taking this really pretty shimmery cranberry shade called amaretto and i'm applying this to my entire lid just like a flat shader brush I'm taking all the way up to my crease but I'm not passing my crease I just want it on my lid I wanted a little bit more in this eyeshadow so I took some mac fix+ and I sprayed it on my brush and then i went in with it like that and you can see that it just like intensifies the eyeshadow a lot more makes it look a little bit more metallic and foiled i recommend dipping your brush into the eyeshadow first and then spring 6 plus so you don't mess up your eyeshadow but yes that is what I did now I took the shade semi-sweet in the palette and on a skinnier and skinnier but like smaller blending brush I am just buffing this into my crease because i wanted the amaretto to blood nicely into my transition shape so I'm just using that to blend all the colors together and then I took a big fluffy brush and blend it some more you know no harsh lines I'm going into the shade cherry cordial it's such a pretty like Matt reddish color but it does have a little bit of glitter doesn't really translate on the lid much but it is stunning i love it so I'm just packing that onto the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging it into my crease a little bit so i took this essence smoky cool eyeliner in black and i'm just using this on my waterline and then I went back into the cherry cordial shade that map read and I am bluffing this on my lower lash line this is so pretty on the lower lash line I just I love red shades like this so with a pencil brush this is a more feet pencil brush I'm just buffing that on my lash line so breaking I love it then I went into hazelnut this color is so beautiful it's like a warm bronze shade I'm just buffing that on my lower lash line so that it's not too harsh under there and it's not like just a line of cherry cordial that makes sense yeah I just mix it in with a little bit he's not now I went into this essence cold again and i'm applying this really really really close to my top lashes and then blending it out with a pencil brush just to create a little bit of smokiness right at the base of the lashes but I didn't want to apply eyeliner that's a good little trick so now i'm going to highlight my brow bone and my inner corners i'm using a champagne truffle on my inner corners and then I used white chocolate underneath my brow bone so I went in with some mascara i use the Elizabeth ma it's so big mascara and then i apply some are dealt with bees in the shade 602 on my lashes it's a very natural fall / which is what i wanted and like before I have already foundation concealer and powder on but i'm going to show you the extra steps I took i'm taking my physicians formula butter bronzer and I'm not really contouring i'm just really warming up my face i'm using the two-faced mr. Wright brush it's like a tulip shaped brush it's amazing so just warming up the skin you know you know the drill I took my to face love blush in the shade baby love I didn't show you the blush like the actual blush but it's just a really pretty nude color and then to highlight my face i'm using the makeup revolution aight highlighter in the shade radiant light it's kind of like a soft pinky highlight but it's so natural and beautiful i love it so inexpensive this is a great highlight some just highlight of my face with that and then for my lip I'm taking the colour-pop ultra satin lip in the shade magic wand it's probably my favorite ultra satin lip they have it's so natural and perfect for everyday it goes with so many looks and i've been loving this formula so i just applied that to my entire lips no lip liner or anything and then that completes look number two ok guys so that completes this video I hope this up huh i hope this video gave you some inspiration to bust out your chocolate bar palette again everything there's a ton of different looks you can do with this so I hope this helped some of you in some way thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys todays video is going to be on this makeup look right here this is a full drug store look and i'm also using affordable brushes as well I really like this look it's an intense eyeliner but everything else is really soft like the soft pink in the crease and the face is really soft as well but the eyeliner is very intense it kind of comes in on the inner corners a little bit cat is this is a little bit different for me because i rarely ever wear eyeliner but after i did this look I'm like eyeliner crazy i love it so i really really hope you guys enjoy this look and let me know in the comments what you think so if you want to see how to get this look then just keep on watching so I'm going to prime my eyelids as usual I like primers like this that also work as a base because they cover up all those ugly little veins on my eyelids and that was the LA girl Pro primer I'm going to dip my finger into this white eyeshadow in the Saudi Akashic I on neutral palette i'm using my finger because the only eyeshadow i don't love in this palette is the white one it's a little bit chalky so I like to use my finger then I'm going to take this fluffy blending brush from Delhi em tools i will link all the brushes down below as well so I'm taking this fluffy crease brush from valium tools and i'm applying that pink color directly in the crease and i am putting this sucker everywhere I wanted to very pink in my crease and i'm going to take this elf brush and I'm going to dip it into this cool tone brown it's a light cool tone tannish Toby color and i'm going to start applying this on the outer V of my eye and bring it into my crease so I'm just packing it on the outer bien and drag me into the crease this am I shadow brush is really easy to do that since its fluffy but flat at the same time going back into the Sonia Kashuk palette i'm going to take this super Toby purplish kind of color and on that same brush I'm going to just do the exact same things so on the outer V and then bring it into my crease i'm using these two shades to kind of you know create some dimension and so it you know has different colors of that makes sense I'm going to take this little trail from one wild walking on eggshells trio and i'm mixing those two shades that was pointing at and i'm going to apply this on the inner half of my lid using this else brush is in one dollar brush and then i'm going to dip my fluffy brush again into the pink and i'm just going to blend everything out sorry I feel like I'm moving for that I'm going to dip that same elf brush into the white I'm really packing it into the white and applying this to my brow bone as a highlight I'm going to take this darker brown in the palette it's also very cool tone but i'm applying this right at the outer view my to create a darkness on the outer corners this is just a darker Brown than the other ones we were using and then I'm going to use my NYC liquid liner and i'm going to apply a very thick wing so what I like to do is I like to draw the line first and then do this and then fill it in so I do that kind of wing first and then I start brushing a little strokes in the end or corners just to connect everything and then yeah i got out of frame but all he did was fill in that part that makes sense I really suck at eyeliner but I just did my typical wing I go back and I fix it but i just did like a basic thick wing do whatever you guys want you don't have to do that so I primary face with a luminous primer and then i'm going to mix these two foundations this is the Maybelline fit me and the maybelline fit me matte and poreless I like to mix these two because i have dry skin so sometimes the fit me the original is a little bit to do it which I do love but mixing it with the new matte and poreless creates a beautiful like natural satin finish I love this combination and i'm using a small stiffer brush tiful know a small stipple brush from ELF because you have to work in sections with the matte and poreless because it dries really really fast and then I realized I had no hearings on sale so I'm just working in sections and i love this brush it gets in the mix and crannies of everything i don't know i really like it so that's what I'm doing then I'm gonna add some concealer to my under eyes this is the LA girl Pro conceal in natural and then i'm going to highlight some more so I'm using the Rimmel conceal and highlight little lighter concealer things and i'm going to apply this all over my face to highlight my face as well i'm going to use this brush from hell this is there a tapered highlighter brush and I'm going to use that to blend in a ball and I really love about brushes the studio line is really a portable and really soft like very soft I love there so I'm just letting that all in then I'm going to take my Maybelline and fit me powder in 135 from natural and I'm gonna set my concealer on my face but to set my under eye can see there i'm using this elf under I setting powder I like it because it's like light reflecting reminds me a lot of the laura mercier secret brightening powder but it's three dollars and not like a million then after that I'm gonna finish off my eyes and I'm going to take that same liquid liner and now i'm going to start a connecting this into the inner part of my eye doesn't make sense I'm making like a little triangle right in the inner tear duct and usually I don't add eyeliner there but i think it creates like a sexy cat eye look as you can see right there so that is what I didn't feel like it ties the eyeliner together really nicely and after that i'm going to take some black eyeliner i have been loving this from nicks it's there like gel eyeliner in black its new looks like their new eyeliner it's amazing guys it's a super black look so black I really love it I'm gonna take this equal tools angled brush and I'm going to dip it into the black eyeshadow and i'm going to set the eyeliner like bringing it really really really really close to my waterline and yeah it's just going to intensify the eyeliner on the lower - line after that I applied mascara to my top and bottom lashes and then i went in with some red cherry or fifteen lashes just finish off the I look I'm gonna tip this more feet crease brush into that brown shade and I'm just gonna keep it up the outer corner like that like I'm just going to apply it really softly right in the outer V kind of in the crease and I feel like it's just going to add a little bit more dimension and finish off the eyes so then i'm going to go ahead and do the rest of my makeup just my face makeup I'm gonna take this NYX high-definition blush in the shade taupe and i'm going to use this to contour this is al what is a powder brush from ELF like a I think it's like a powder foundation brush and i love it for contouring because it's not too small but it's not too big this is a very a she blushed I got to be color very a she's so perfect for contouring but just to warm up the skin a little bit not too much i'm gonna tip that same brush into my NYC son and bronzer bronzer in Montauk bronze just gonna warm it up a little bit because that taupe blush is like great like hella gray like super super a she's so you do have to be a little bit careful after that I'm going to take this beautiful like to love style brush from Delhi I'm tools and i'm going to use this to apply my blush this is the next High Definition blush in soft-spoken i believe i will leave all the information in the description box it's a really pretty light peachy color love this blush then of course the highlight my physician formula shimmer strip in naturally new and i'm applying that with an elf blush brush to the tops of my cheekbones and on the bridge of my nose and all that good stuff and I'm just going to do my lips this is the Rimmel exaggerate the liner in natural i believe it's what it's called and the reason i'm applying this lip liner is because the lipstick , to put on top looks awful without a lip liner underneath because it settles into my lines really badly none of the rest of those lipsticks and that line do but that one kind of settles but i love the color so i have to put a lip liner underneath and i'm using the Milani moisture matte lipstick and match innocence hey guys that completes the look I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's a makeup tutorial is on this look right here it's like the most simplest look ever mainly wanted to do this video because i used the Maybelline Dream bronze a BB cream this product is like pretty new and I decided to take inspiration from it so i did like a very tanned skin bronzy makeup actually pretty tired of having a fresh tan on I don't know if my lights are showing that I mainly wanted to focus this tutorial on the face like a very bronze glowy face so the eyes are very very simple very basic i'm actually going to talk about this a little bit more at the end of the video so if you want a review on this product just stay tuned to after the tutorial and if you want to see how to get these little then just keep watching ok so I'm a fool and I didn't show you guys what I'm a mixing or what i'm using but I mix the Maybelline Dream pur BB cream and with the Maybelline Dream bronze BB cream like I showed you earlier i mix those two together because the bronze one on its own is a little bit - bronze so I wanted to mix in one with like more of a flesh tone or one closer to my face and then I realized in this clip that i didn't put on primer but that's okay this kind of work to the primer and a BB cream all in one but that glow girl look at that glow some intense bronze venus I like it so yeah Here I am showing you the two things that I mixed i'm thinking the NYX HD concealer in the shade of beige and i'm applying this underneath my eyes to kind of highlight and cover up my dark circles as well i'm playing out to my eyes as well to kind of use it as a primer and eyeshadow base i'm highlighting other parts of my face - like I always do that i'm going to take this dream lumi concealer and i'm going to apply that all over the areas that I applied that concealer because that can see there is kind of thick so applying this on top not only helps highlight but it kind of makes it easier to blend out that nyx concealer and of course blending that with my favorite concealer blending brush this is the sedona lace - 17 yeah yeah now i'm gonna take the maybelline fit me powder in 135 creamy natural I cannot find 135 anywhere i hope they didn't discontinued because it's my favorite setting powder under the eyes from the drugstore and if they discontinued it will be very sad yes i'm just using that I want to take this bourgeois bronzing primer it's amazing look at it beautiful it's very similar to this Chanel too late and a Chanel whatever that's called it's very similar it's just like a mu see consistency and it's a nice warm bronzy color so i'm using my Real Techniques sculpting brush to just bronze up my face I'm not trying to like do any harsh contouring since this is a warmer bronzer I'm just giving myself more of a tan you no more war me this is a seal of blush what is this called what is called was called this is the Aqua glow water color blush and this is in the shade shimmering lotus I like to apply on the back of my hand first because it can get a little pins and then apply it to my cheeks is basically like a liquid blush it's not even a cream it's like a pure liquid blush it's kind of awesome I really like it's really pretty if you get used to like you have to get used to blending it out since it's so weird cause it's like a liquid out of them this is the Milani bronzer in the shade glow i use this more kind of like a warm blush because it's a bronzer but it has a little bit of pink to it and it's very shimmery it's actually really really pretty especially in the summertime I'm going to move on to my eyes I want to keep it very very simple so i'm using the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade glow a nice like when the shade i'm using this to highlight underneath my brow bone using a morphing brush not sure what that one is called I think it's the e 14 maybe i'm also applying that in beach like in my tear duct area as well then I'm going to take the shade Cornelius by the way these both of these eyeshadows are from my collab with color pop the where the light is quad oh yeah i'm taking Cornelius and i'm applying this to my entire lid yeah I'm dragging that underneath my lower lash line as well this is a very very natural color but like i said i wanted to keep it very simple I'm going to take a fluffy brush to get right back into Cornelius and then apply this to my crease to kind of diffuse the look and just bring it up higher yeah I'm gonna take this milani Bella eyeshadow in the shade fellowship on such as stunning like white gold and our planet in my inner tear ducts and everything else is so mad i want a very bright in the corner then I'm going to take this a it was gone oh the kat von d ink liner I believe this is in the shame actually I have it here let me check to do this is in the shade Hemingway so i'm applying this really really close to my lash line as if i was going to wing it out but I actually don't get out I just create a line and i like it because it's brown it's not as harsh and then i'm going to apply two coats of my L'Oreal telescopic mascara and I also applied that to my bottom lashes for my lips I'm keeping it very very simple i'm just using the anastacio lip gloss in the shade and dressed and that's all I'm doing for my lips so yeah now if you want to see a readme review on the BB cream just keep watching so if you're watching this part of the video that you want my little review on this product I didn't want to do a whole separate review on this since i have that cover girl foundation review up and I don't like to review so much i like this product this is the second time i use it the first time I used it completely by itself and it wasn't my favorite because it's dark I have the 14 light to medium skin tones um and it's like a medium I wouldn't say it's for light to medium if you are super fair i recommend using this as a bronzer like as a cream bronzer or you can use this mixed in which is how i like to use it and if you are really really dark skin I think they might have deeper ones so the way that I like to use this is mixed with foundations when I'm tan because it is a bronzer kind of I like to mix it in like today I mix it in with my dream cure BB cream to get like a more light weight coverage and it works really really well this way I don't like the original BB cream the Maybelline by like this one has salicylic acid and it's it's good oh yeah this would be awesome if you want super jennifer lopez skin SI lo as superintendent for Lopez skin but you have a very very matte foundation so mixing in a little bit of this is just going to make it really dewy and bronzy I kind of really love that about this I like it to mix by itself no you could also use this like on top of your foundation just to kind of like bronzed up the skin like a liquid bronzer so I really like this idea I actually kind of love it I think it's really good i've only used it twice but i'm playing around with it and i really like how it's been working for me so i highly recommend it only if you have normal to dry skin oily skin stay away from this unless you're using it in certain areas as browser so yeah that is my quick little mini review I hope you guys enjoyed this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video hey guys so I am currently in a storm the power has almost gone out like four times so I'm like hanging by a string right now hoping that the power doesn't get cut off so that at least this lamp can illuminate me somewhat but today's video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right now it was perfectly sunny when i started doing this tutorial than halfway through it it started to pour like a mother and I like my power almost went out like i said and it was just it and I would have just stopped recording i would have filmed this tomorrow but i was already like doing my makeup and I was like they're my peeps most subscribers are my peeps they're not going to care if it's a little dark they never do because I'm always complaining about it and you guys are really nice about it huh it was an epic lightning no and I was waiting for the thunder but notice way I wanted to do a really deep smoky eye like a suitable for clubbing and stuff like that but since it is summertime I wanted to incorporate color as well so it is very dark and dramatic and klemish but it's also colorful - it's not your basic like a deep black silver look it's kind of fun and has a good twist to it colorful I like it anyway if you want to see a tutorial on this makeup look then you can go ahead keep watching so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to prime my eyes I'm using Urban Decay primer potion and then i'm gonna take a piece of scotch tape put on the back of my hand first and then put it right next to my I to create like a sharp cat eye effect i am taking my Urban Decay Naked basics palette and I'm taking the color called naked - I believe it's called and i'm just going to be applying this in my crease buffing this color in dipping my brush and little by little and just building up that color this is just going to work as a transition shade so that everything blend well then I'm going to take my NYX jumbo pencil in black bean I'm going to put this all over my lid and then blend it out with my finger for this tutorial i am using the Urban Decay electric palette i'm going to take the little brush that comes the palette and I'm dipping it into the color freak and I'm going to apply this to the inner part of my I just focusing it mainly near the tear duct area then I'm going to take this color right here it is called fringe is a beautiful teal and on the other side of the brush I'm going to apply this to my entire lid and putting black as a base is really going to make this eyeshadow stand out its gonna make it like a deep sea foam teal kind of color i don't know i really love how this looks right on top of black so yeah i'm just applying this to my whole lid right up to the crease then I'm gonna take a fluffy brush with no additional product and i'm just going to start blending out those edges yeah then I'm going to take a mac 217 brush and dip it into naked - from the Urban Decay basics palette and I'm going to start blending this out even more this is the type of look that does look kind of ugly and messy before it starts to look pretty but don't worry about it just keep truck in and keep blending and it'll all turn out just fine I'm gonna take this one right here called faint and i'm just going to blend some more like I said this is a lot a lot of blending because the colors are so vibrant and pigmented you want to make sure you blend them out nicely then I'm going to go back into the fluffy brush and just blend out the harsh edges and then because of all that blending some of the color did go away obviously so I'm just going to take that fringe color again and apply it to my entire lid and then I'm going to do the same with the free color now with my mac 217 i'm actually dipping it into the color fringe which is the blue one we put on the entire lid and i'm going to add some of this to my crease and then a fluffy brush with no additional product and just blending some more lots and lots of blending to highlight i am going to take the highlight shade in The Naked basics palette and apply underneath my brow bone and in my inner tear duct i'm going to create a thin wing and i am using the bombs showing eyeliner and its really good to use tape when it comes to doing a wing because it's foolproof and its really really easy the tape is going to act as a guideline so you just want to add a wing and even though it looks messy when you take the tape off it's nice and sharp so I'm just going to add a thin little wing then I'm going to take my Maybelline master drama eyeliner as always and I'm going to tight line with this yeah I'm going to take a flat shader brush and I'm going to take the black and the Naked basics palette and I'm going to start packing this really really close to the tape I wanted to be the darkest right at the edge of the tape so I'm just going to pack that color and then start dragging it towards the inner part of my eye so it's nice and faded and the color little by little so it's not too harsh then I'm just going to take off the tape and you see it's nice and sharp and with a white be i'm just going to clean up any fallout moving onto my face i'm using the chafing really powder gel and i'm going to use this as a primer yes it is for mana stats but its silicone base and it's good for your pores and stuff so that's what i'm using for my foundation i am using my l'oreal true match foundation and three natural buff and my trusty handy-dandy Real Techniques bunch I keep forgetting what this is called I think it's like an miracle complexion sponge i'm not i don't remember but seriously guys this sponge is amazing if you don't own it already i recommend it it's very affordable it's very comparable to the Beauty Blender and i love it I'm going to move onto concealer and i am using my Maybelline fit me concealer and 15 fair and i'm just gonna apply this underneath my eyes to cover my dark circles and to highlight a little bit I always do this step but you know the usual I'm not very careful when I do this I just make sure that my under eye area is nice and concealed and highlighted and then i'm going to first blend it out with the sponge and then i'm going to further blend it out with my Real Techniques contour brush to set it i'm going to use my Mac emphasize powder and this is just going to set the concealer so that it does not crease so moving on to the eyes again i'm going to take my Maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master and i'm going to use this on my waterline then I'm going to take this fake color again and I'm going to run this underneath my lower lash line all the way to my inner tear duct and I'm sorry it is really dark this is when I started pouring like crazy so again I apologize i'm gonna add some mascara to my top and bottom lashes this is the clinical lash doubling mascara and then i'm going to apply my red cherry lashes in 747 and more yeah 747 mmm i love these lashes they're amazing so yeah then I'm going to smell my bronzer apparently this is the too faced chocolate soleil bronzer it smells like chocolate and it's really good and I am just going to apply this all over my face contouring a little bit just rounding up my face this bronzer is so pigmented that you can get pretty heavy pretty quickly so just use a light hand with it i'm using my ELF complexion brush I believe that's what it's called and then I'm just going to apply this to my neck and underneath my chin as well for blush I'm using my NYX blush in the shade mom and being nice mavi pinky color it's really really pretty and it's light for my highlight I'm using the bombs mary-lou manizer and i am using my Sigma contour brush to apply this on my cheekbones i'm also going to apply this to the bridge of my nose and on my Cupid's well as well for my lips I'm using the NYX butter lipstick in the shade fun size and i'm applying this to my lips and then i'm going to top it off with buck some lip gloss in White Russian yeah elephants combination it gives it like a nice milky glossy pink I really like it so that is the end of this tutorial thank you guys so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed it please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my

to me right off the bat she gave me like a little shout-out in her video when I have like 25 subscribers and I thought it was the sweetest thing and we text all the time she has become a really good friend of mine we talk about makeup all the time we're just like a bunch of girly girls talking back and forth so we decided it would be a good idea for both of us to upload tutorials using this palette she is doing a more daytime appropriate look and this is more like a sultry evening type of look i would i would totally wear this during the day but for people who don't like this much eyeshadow during the day think this would be a beautiful date night look because it's just it's really sultry and romantic anything that this would look so beautiful on pretty much every single eye color like literally this would look amazing on brown eyes like amazing so i'm going to go ahead and links Raines channel down below make sure you go check her out and watch her daytime look using it

dark side i'm just using this to deepen out my other be a little bit i start on the outer be and then kind of bring it in and then I'm adding some into my crease as well like very precise in the hollows of my crease I don't want this to go too far past my crease yeah then I'm just going to line my waterline and my tight line with Maybelline eye liner in midnight master now i'm taking this color here called burnout it's a really nice soft champagne II kind of pink and i'm just going to brighten the inner corners of my eyes with this eyeshadow and also take it on my inner took just a little bit now taking the lightest shade in the palette this is going to be my brow bone highlight going back into nooner I am really going to be putting this in my crease right now i wanted to be

taking black heart I'm just going to deepen out the outer V just a little bit more I feel like it really makes it a little bit more sultry and smoky ish so I'm just packing that on with a tiny little flat shader brush just a deep in a little bit now i'm taking this color trick and i'm using my finger to put this right in the center of my eyelids just to give it that little pop of gold i'm blending on my lower lash line with that nooner shade and then I'm going to take black heart and add some of that color just to make it a little bit more smoky then I want to add some mascara and i am using jordanna's best / extreme and then this will complete the eyes really quickly then I'm just going to breathe past my face just because i know some people just wanted to see an eye tutorial but some people like to see the whole face application process so I'm just priming my face with the hard candy sheer envy primer and then i'm taking my L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation and i'm applying that all over my face with my Real Techniques what it's called complexion perfection sponge I think that inning yeah now i'm taking my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser and i am just

i'm watching a YouTube video as i am filming this that's why I'm like looking to the side youtuber at heart that's all I do watch youtube videos that's my life and then I got really hot little red by ear is like freaking me out i was so hot anyway i'm taking my favorite blush of all time you guys know it max Melba and then I'm just gonna be popping that on my cheeks as my blush with the compliments these eyes really really well and i'm just going to highlight with my Mac soft and gentle and then I had to pick up my hair a little bit because I was burning so hot I'm taking my NYX soft matte lip cream in the color tokyo and i'm just going to dab that on my lips and then kind of blend it out just to give it a soft pink color but then I'm topping it off with my NYX butter gloss and creme brulee and that is the end of this tutorial thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next hey guys so today's video is going to be a quick eye makeup tutorial using color pop I shadows this is a top tutorial just because I'm only doing my eye makeup in this video I'm only doing my eye makeup in this video because I specifically want to show you how the colour-pop eyeshadows work on me or I wanted to show you this I look at everything on the rest of my face will be in the description box as per usual but anyway if you want to see this nice metallic gold I then just keep watching my eyebrows look super scary right now because I have nothing else on my face don't be alarmed ok so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to prime my eyelids and i'm going to be using the elf glitter primer to do that you don't only have to use this primer for glitter you can use it for just regular eye shadows - I find that it really helps out here your shadows to your eyelids this doesn't look like a tacky feeling to your eyelids but I find that these eyeshadows I'm get any skipping you know like if you were to apply a powder eyeshadow on top of a sticky base it was kind of like skipping it stuck but these are so light creamy that I find that they will get stuck I'm going to start by applying a color to my crease and for that I am going to take this color right here called smash it it isn't a matte eyeshadow by any means at all you can see but it isn't glittery or sparkly so for the crease it gives you a nice finish it does have like a sheen to it but it I think it's so pretty for the crease I'm going to take my more feet and b25 brush this is like the perfect brush to apply this eyeshadow with I just decided to go ahead and do this I and then bring you in closer ok so next I'm going to take this color right here and it is called get lucky and it is literally my favorite eyeshadow out of all the color pop I shall I own it is incredible incredible incredible definitely recommend using these with your finger as i said in my review look at that look at that Sheen oh so good now i'm just going to take this one again which is the one I used in my crease taking that brush and blending out that gold a little bit and then going back in to get lucky and layering it again now because I don't have an inner corner or brow bone highlight type of color i'm going to just take my milani Bella eyeshadow in bella chiffon and i'm going to use that to highlight underneath my route ok let's get in the frame and it looks white in the pan but it has a beautiful gold Sheen to it ok this also is what I used to highlight my face and I'm just in love with this look okay and really quickly i'm just going to add a little wing i'm going to use my NYC liquid eyeliner in my Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner and I'm just gonna a little wing off camera i also added my Maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master ok so we are almost time for my lower lash line i'm going to take the color smash again and on this outer be brush from makeup geek i am going to run that underneath my lash line then I'm gonna take this really fun color it here called I heart this I need to be in the frame what is wrong with me it is called I heart this and it is absolutely gorgeous like out of this world and i'm going to take it on a tiny little brush like this this is from coastal sense and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my elf makeup lock and seal and i'm just going to pour some right onto the brush and then dip it into the product and this isn't gonna mess up the product at all because it is a cream product anyway so I'm going to do it right into the product and run that underneath my lash line and this is just going to intensify the eye shadow if you don't have this you could use mac fix+ or eye drops that all works the same yeah yeah you can get quite a bit of fallout with this eyeshadow that's why i usually do my eyes before but since this wasn't a full tutorial I just did my face makeup but when you do use eyeshadow i recommend using I'm doing it before your face makeup but its cord back into this makeup geek out of the brush and just going to get right back into smash and do that one more time and this time I'm going to bring it a little bit further down just to make it nice and bronze and smoky down there now I'm just going to curl my lashes apply some mascara I'm using mac and extreme dimension 3d blacklash longest night meta ok guys so that completes its eye makeup tutorial really hope you guys enjoyed it and maybe you check out the colour-pop eye shadows because they're so expensive there are five dollars a pop and they are good thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing I know of course I have had a lot of requests in the past to do a bridal makeup look so I decided to do one specifically using the drugstore products and i'm also using all affordable brushes in this video as well I really really love this type of makeup and this type of look for weddings but I mean everybody has different tastes everybody wants to do different things this is just my take on really soft feminine bridal makeup by the way i will say this video is going to be a long one because it is a talk through tutorial actually had to empty on my memory card like almost at the end of the video so i know it's long i know sorry about that and actually fun fact that and I didn't have a wedding we couldn't afford one when we got married so we didn't have like a big wedding but if we would have had a huge like wedding or like a nice or even a small wedding this is the makeup I would have done something very very similar to this even though it is drugstore I would have done something very similar so anyway I hope you guys enjoy this video and if you want to see how to get this drugstore bridal little makeup then just keep watching ok so I'm just gonna get my hair out of my face really quick so I'm going to start off with eyebrows and normally I would do this step before coming on camera and filming out tutorial you guys know this but i have decided to do it on camera for the purpose of this video and look naked throughout this video don't I i'm going to be using the elf instant lift a brow pencil another really good drugstore brow pencil is the Knicks won it looks really similar to this it's in a pencil form with a spoolie on the end you guys know I like a bold bra but I'm gonna try to make my brows a little bit more natural although i really do love that look I think that a nice feminine brow is prettier on your wedding day all I'm doing is following the natural shape of my brows just shading them in a little bit darker so they look a little bit more visible more prominent okay so I got a little too bold all right just fill in your brows the way you are comfortable filling them in i am going to set them with a brow gel or a brow mascara because this is not enough on its own i don't think any brow product is enough on its own you are going to need something that's going to keep it in place all day even if you don't have long eyebrow hairs this is really going to make the product underneath it take a lot longer I always liked how I do my eyebrows the day that I do them on camera I hate them african hate them i'm going to start working on my face because the eye makeup i'm doing is really natural and there's not much fallout so I'm gonna do all my face makeup first i highly recommend a primer on your wedding day one that is really really good from the drugstore is the Knicks angel wheel I find that my makeup does last longer when i use this its oil free and it is really really really great for all skin types but because i do have really dry skin i'm going to add a little bit of the law real magic Lumi primer I'm going to mix them and i'm gonna apply it to my face like that yeah the foundation i'm going to be using today is the revlon colorstay foundation this is the one for normal to dry skin because the regular I cannot use its way too cakey and to share out the formula a little bit i am using a damp Real Techniques complexions fun to these are about seven dollars at ulta or anywhere they sell real techniques and i'm going to start balancing this onto my skin a beauty blender or ace wet sponge Wilshere out the coverage just a little bit and make the foundation look a little bit more natural on your skin and that's why i recommend if you are getting married not to use a really thick and cakey foundation because that's just not really flattering if you need really really full-coverage then using a beauty blender or a sponge like this will really help that this is a full coverage foundation but i am actually just applying a shear shear layer i'm going to drag it down my neck make sure to drag your foundation down your neck don't apply it straight to your neck but on just drag it down your neck so that everything matches better and it doesn't look like you have a foundation mask I'm gonna go in with concealer and you can see that i'm going to be using our the Allegro broken seals you can get this on the LA girl website la girl usa.com or drugstore com i believe yes i'm going to mix these two shades I'm gonna mix natural this is a more peachy color to counteract dark circles and then i'm going to use creamy beige really hate the packaging on this for me it's hard to squeeze out product but i'm using this product today in this tutorial because i find that has really great coverage and it lasts all the on my skin it doesn't look bad in photography and ice I'm telling you it last forever on the skin yeah just going to add a little bit on the bridge of my nose here and on my chin I'm not going to highlight anywhere else and I don't want to pack on the concealer because this is a thicker concealer so I don't want my skin to look cakey so I'm just blending this in with a real techniques contour brush I would normally go for a much lighter concealer underneath my eyes you guys know to brighten up under there and to look extra in production but you know for our wedding you don't want that stark white look underneath your eyes especially in pictures or anything like that this combo just looks a lot more natural on me so the next thing you want to do is set your under-eye concealer because if you don't set it with powder it will crease my favorite drugstore setting powder for underneath the eyes is the Maybelline fit me i also love this on my entire face with this shade specifically is for my under eye it's 135 creamy natural using the Real Techniques setting brush and I'm just going to set that up now the next step I wouldn't typically do but for anybody with normal to oily skin i highly recommend you setting your face with powder even if you have dry skin it might be a better idea to set your face makeup because it's just going to make it last longer i'm going to use the most a matte powder to set my face but i'm going to use a very very light layer of this sometimes I find that this can flash back and photography and make my skin look a little bit white by the way this the revlon colorstay foundation I think um the original has SPF but this one doesn't say it has SPF at all I don't know why the normal to dry skin one doesn't say it has SPF but if it does or if it doesn't it does not flash back in photography which is why i really like it and why would recommend it for like wedding makeup but anyway i'm just going to take this real techniques blush brush and dab it dab it dab it in ever so slightly and just set my face yeah never looked this matt crazy ok so now i'm going to contour my cheekbones just a little bit personally for me on your wedding day I don't think that can cart cart auction that Kim Kardashian structure is very flattering i'm going to use the elf contour palette and I'm going to use this elf mineral powder blush brush and I'm going to dip it into this cool tone color right here I don't know if you can tell what they gave me just a slight contour to this side of my face and I have a very large forehead is so much in a con call day so I'm just gonna contour around a little tense and bring it to the other sign and come forward and just a little bean and then do the same thing here i'm going to move onto bronzing the skin I contoured but I still want warmth back into my skin i'm going to use the physicians formula bronze booster it's probably one of my favorite drugstore bronzers because it's not a flat matte shade so i'm going to use a dell IAM tools and 74 brush like a tulip shaped brush you can get these online at the lamb tools and I am just going to bronze the cheeks not contouring just loving this on my cheeks just like I said bronzing the skin i'm also going to bring this to my jaw line right here ok so now i'm going to go ahead and add a blush I think this is a beautiful beautiful beautiful like wedding makeup kind of blush this is the essence silky touch blush in the shade baby doll i got this for like two dollars at ulta it's a stunning pink it looks like a regular pink in the pan but it does have a sheen to it i'm going to use the more feet and 5 56 brush this brush is about ten . nine ninety nine and I technology and i'm just going to pop this on my cheeks now i do recommend going a little bit overboard not okay not overboard by adding a little bit more blush then you usually would because that is the first thing to go on your skin so you always want to apply a little bit more than you normally would because it is going to fade anyway so just remember that I'm just popping it right here to the apples swirling it around and then bring it back to blend everything ok so because my face is really really mad right now and I like glow I mean I do have a little bit of love my cheeks but I like a nice glow I'm first going to going with the wet and wild color icon bronzer this is not a bronze are clearly this is a blush I mean he highlight and this is in the shade reserve your cabana this is the most subtle highlight ever like the most subtle highlight in my collection when it comes to the drugstore but it gives your cheeks like a glow from within so i highly recommend this for those of you who have large pores who have like textured rough textured skin because this is not going to emphasize your skin what so ever going to give you a very subtle glow so if you like a band highlight that don't go for this but it's not going to emphasize your skin which is what i really really like about this i'm going to take the elf no this is not off the siding brush by Real Techniques and i'm going to lightly start highlighting this is a stunning highlight four Brides because it is so natural especially for those of you with oily skin because it's not going to be too much you're not going to look really you're just gonna look like you are naturally glowy can you see it it's very subtle so I'm going to take this on the bridge of my nose so the first thing I'm gonna do is prime my eyelids you want to make sure that you are priming your lids especially on your wedding day because you want your eye makeup to stay in place the entire day this is the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer so the eyeshadows i'm going to be working with come from two products the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and the wet and wild walking on eggshells little trio I'm going to take this eyeshadow brush from ELF this is from there one dollar line and I'm going to dip it into this color right here it's a nice pink champagne and i'm just going to apply this to my entire lid i'm also going to take that same brush with that same eyeshadow and i'm going to apply this to my inner corner i'm also going to take this color here labeled brow bone and it's a white with a little bit of gold chain so I'm going to go right on top of this just to make it even brighter and I look scary right here but it all ties together now i'm going to take this Real Techniques domed shadow brush and I'm going to dip it into this color right here labeled crease it's a really pretty of warm brown it has a little bit of a sheen to it nothing too crazy i will be putting this into the crease and even though it has shimmer it doesn't look bad but first I'm just going to start packing it right here on the outer corners just a little bit and then i'm going to start dragging it up into the crease yeah now i'm going to take the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matter how I taking this a regular eyeshadow brushes and go ahead and use the same alpha brush this one is from Coastal Scents the only a few dollars and i'm going to take this brown right here right in the middle it's a nice neutral ground up to warm up the pool and i'm just going to put this on the outer corners of my eyes a little bit just to deepen them up a bit not too much then I'm just going to drag a little bit into my crease here for my problem highlights I don't want anything too stark too shimmery too bold so I'm going to just take the same highlight i use on my face this wet and wild reserve your cabana this is a neckl tools eyeshadow brush and I'm just going to apply this to my brow bone this is just going to lift the brow a little bit ok so at this point you can do a winged eyeliner look or whatever if you really want to i'm not going to do that I want to do something a little bit softer so I'm gonna take the Sonia Kashuk palette and I'm going to use this matte black shade right here and we're going to use it as an eyeliner and using a an eyeshadow as an eyeliner is just going to make it a little bit softer and not as harsh so I'm taking that same brush i just used to highlight my brow bone and flipping it over cuz it's a double-ended one and i'm going to use this little angled one for my lower lashes i'm just going to take this equal tools brush right here this is called the flat eyeliner brush and I'm just gonna do it right into this brown that we put in our crease and put that right really really close to the water line but to add a little bit more definition i'm going to take the brown that we used on the outer corners of our eyes in this palette this one here this one in the middle and i'm just going to add some to the outer corners now typically on a day-to-day basis i would just add black or brown eyeliner but i'm going to add a nude eyeliner this is the Rimmel wake me up know what like me up for the cover the rear most can analyze coachella waterproof eyeliner in the shade new applying this to my waterline because this is really going to bring it up the eyes make them look bigger instead of using a black which would make them look smaller so applying a nude eyeliner is a nice little trick so I will be applying falsies don't feel like you have to if you have nice luscious long lashes go ahead and apply some mascara I'm gonna a pile on the telescopic carbon black mascara from l'oreal before i go in with falsies ok so these are the finished eyes right here all I did was apply mascara to my bottom and top lashes and then i went in with policies and the ones I used you can see them cause I mean there are my eyes but they are from our dell and they are the dummies ok so for my lips I would normally do because it's like wedding makeup I would do a lip liner lipstick and lip gloss on top so i think glossy lips are pretty like for a bright i'm gonna go ahead and just skip the lip liner today because the lip liner I wanted to use which is east and not by Rimmel I'd emerges so i'm going to go ahead and take the Milani lipstick in the shade nude cream i think this is a stunning bridal lip color i think it's so pretty just going to apply the online and lips and then to add a nice glossy like top coat i'm going to use the Knicks mega shine lipgloss in the shade sugar pie right yes sugar pie it has a sheen to it so it makes your lips look nice and juicy ok

take the mac program prime little pen in the shade light boost and i'm going to highlight with this product yeah I just went ahead and blend it in with the same brush so I decided to do something different i am setting my under eye concealer using the wet n wild color icon highlight in reserve your curb at cabana reserve your cabana it's a very subtle highlight so i use it underneath my eyes to really really really bright in that area for bronzer i'm using the Real Techniques multitask brush and dipping it into the too faced chocolate soleil and I tasted a little bit when I was applying it as you saw this is the milk chocolate silly not the original this one is much lighter i love this one for my skin when I'm a little more fair that i decided to add just a little bit of a pinky warmth penis with the bombs bomb desert I only applied very little bit to my cheeks to highlight my face i'm using the elf sunkist bronzer in the shade sun kissed it's not a bronzer but it is a very very golden highlights it's a very strong gold but it's such a beautiful highlight and it is two bucks at your local target or wherever they sell elf I love this highlight it is so golden I love it so now i'm going to go ahead and do my eye makeup I am taking the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade glow i'm applying that underneath my brow bone yes and to my inner corners then I'm going to take this shape right here called Cornelius and i'm applying this into my crease with a kat von d brush I'm only applying very little for now and then I'm gonna take this josie maran water color eyeshadow it's the beautiful gold 1i have a list of every like everything down below this is that green one that is a gold this is the green one ok yes and I just mix that in with my finger and then I took color pops eyeshadow in the shade blaze and I applied it right on top with my finger this eyeshadow is definitely blessed best applied with your finger so just padded that in that I'm taking a Bobby round single eyeshadow in the shade camel it's such a deliciously beautiful like yellow yellow brown and applying this into my crease with a little fluffy crease brush then I'm going to take a dark brown eyeshadow this one's just from a jouer but you can use any dark eyeshadow you want and I am just putting this into my crease so that everything blends nicely and there are no harsh lines I'm going back into blaze and just apply another layer to my lid just in case any of it was blended away I want to add just a little bit of a golden this to my inner corners so i'm just applying the elf highlight right on top of the glow eyeshadow then I'm going to take the colour-pop Cornelius shade again and on a pencil brush i'm just applying this underneath my eyes then going in with this NYX eyeshadow it's one of their prismatic eyeshadows this is like the emerald green one and i just love the contrast of the bronze on the lid and the emerald green on the lower lash line I think it looks really pretty so I just smoke that out with that eye shadow and then I applied my mascara so to finish off this look I'm going to do my lips this is the charlotte tilbury pillow talk lip liner and then i'm going to apply the colour-pop lippie stick in the shade pollywog right on top ok guys so that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here this is the look I was wearing in my morphe palette swatches video that i posted on monday it's just a little bit more intense i added a little bit more black eyeshadow than I did that day and I added a little bit of a gloss on top as well but more or less that's pretty much the exact same look i will link this palette down below in case you're interested i also have a ten percent off code with morphy in case you're interested it's just kathleenlights safety ten percent but yes i will exist below this is my personal favorite look to do with this palette because it's so smoky and i love it for going out at night clubbing a romantic dinner i love how super smoky eyes pair with a really really nude lip but if you're not into that super nude lip i know a lot of people aren't just pop on whatever color you want and I know I say about time that this look is actually super easy because there's no winged eyeliner or any false lashes of course you can add a wing you can add some false lashes make it even more dramatic but I feel like they look smoky and dramatic enough to where it doesn't need eyeliner or false lashes so if you're someone who just doesn't mess with the falsies or the eyeliner this look is definitely for you and yeah I guess that's only have to say you want to get this look then just keep watch ok so i have already primed my eyelids and i'm going in with my milani shadow lies in black ink by the way I'm getting a cold so my voice is very Gracie right now but i'm just using this as a base underneath my eye shadows it's just like a black chubby crayon i'm going to take this light orangie peachy color in my crease from the palette and this is going to be the transition shade i'm really gonna pack this color into my crease because i want the crease to be very very warm and then i'm going to go in with this bronze shade right here and I'm just going to take a flat shading brush and apply this to my entire lid right on top of that black color now I'm going to take that peachy color again and I'm just building some more of this color into the crease and then I'm gonna go back into the palette and I'm going to use this gray cool tone brown color and i'm going to use this to kind of blend those two eyeshadows together the bronze and the orange this is gonna be like a sandwich in shade just using this to blend out the edges making sure there are no harsh lines and then I'm going to take this light matte color in the palette and I'm going to use this as my brow bone highlight i'm going to add another color on top of it but just for now that's the brow bone highlight excuse so I'm gonna take the black in the palette and I'm just packing this color on the outer corners of my eyes and slightly dragging this into the crease I want to make the look nice and smoky i'm just applying that black little by little and then I applied some more of that bronze color on the inner part of my eye to intensify the shade a bit i'm going back into that cool tone grey brown color and I'm just blending some of that into the greats I'm going back in with the bronze chain you know just layering so I'm going to start with my face makeup before i finish up the eyes and i'm taking my NYX angel primer as my primary to smooth the skin and then i went over it with the maybelline fit me Matt and poreless foundation and i'm just applying that by bouncing a damp sponge on my face so for concealer i'm using the trees liquid camouflage high coverage concealer i love this concealer so so much it's definitely one of my favorites at ulta and it's like three or four dollars i love it i'm just applying this underneath my eyes to not only highlight my face a little bit but to cover up my dark circles this has really really great coverage i'm in the shade light beige and then to set that down i'm using the NYC smooth skin loose translucent setting powder and i'm just sitting everywhere put some concealer down ok so to finish up the eyes i'm gonna take that first shade in the palette and just apply a little bit underneath the brow bone and then I took a little bit more of that peachy orange shade and apply some in my crease and then i applied the same BTW orange shade underneath and lower lash line and then I took my next pleasure Lee gel pencil liner in the shade pitch black and I use that to tightline and to apply to my waterline as well and then I'm gonna take a smaller little pencil brush and I'm gonna take that grayish brown color and i'm going to focus that really really close to my waterline I'm sorry that these parts of the video are a little bit blurry I don't know why my camera was not focusing on my eyeball it was like focusing on my hair so strange i'm sorry but I applied some of that to my lower lashline and then at the very outer corners I applied some of that black eyeshadow with the same brush I took some more of that peachy color on a fluffier pencil brush and just blend it all those eyeshadows together nice and smooth and blended and I just curled my lashes and I applied my it cosmetics superhero mascara and that's it wait what's happening although we have to highlight my inner corners ok so i took the first shade in the palette and I highlighted my inner corners with that because it's so intense and so brightening and i love it but now we are done with the eyes ok so for my face i'm contouring my face using the chemical on sculpting powder in the shade light and I'm just contouring my face with this this look is kind of you know dramatic and smoky so I want to make sure I'm carving out my cheekbones and i'm contouring but i also wanted a little bit of warmth to the face i wanted to bronze up the skin a little bit so i use the hourglass ambient lighting bronzer in the shade luminous bronze light and I'm just putting that everywhere then I'm gonna I'm not necessarily bake but i'm just going to clean up my contour a little bit using that same NYC powder i just applied a little bit of powder there or a lot of powder and left it on for like a second and then just did it away and cleaned up my contour of it so for blush I'm taking this medication after go after girl after glow blush in the shade indecent it's a very peachy orange shade i love it and for highlight I'm taking one of the new jay highlights this is in the shade citrine it's definitely my favorite one out of all of them and I'm just highlighting my face with this color with this highlight whatever you want to call it and then to finish off the look i'm applying a liquid lipstick this is a very very nude liquid lipstick this is from dose of colors and it's in the shade sand it's very very light but i really like it and then I applied some lip gloss on top this is the Catrice infinite shine lipgloss in the shade like a new life and yeah that completes this look I really

those veins on my eyelids and two prime them of course I'm gonna go into this tart tartlets palette right here and on this way of a brush I'm going to dip it into the color free spirit and basically what I'm doing is just kind of studying at the base i put down so it's not sticky then I'm going to go back into the palette and I'm gonna do a fluffy blending brush into the shade natural beauty this is like a really light mabi purpley great color so it's perfect as a transition shade so that's what i'm using it for I'm just a buffing this back and forth into my crease so that all the other eyeshadows that I put down on my lid blend nicely into the crease at that then with a more precise blending brushes from soil but it's just like a mac 217 I'm gonna dip it into the shade best friend this one is a lot more purple it's basically just like a mid-tone like matte purple color everything in this palette is matt by the way and so i'm just applying this to the outer V of my eye and

going to blend it out with my finger it's like a really concentrated metallic pigment so I'm just taking my ring finger and just blending and out then for my favorite part i'm going to take this pigment from makeup geek in the shade nightlife it's a beautiful like to see like champagne with like a totally unknown oh I know it's really gorgeous on the lid and i'm going to apply this all over my entire lid up to the crease to intensify that pigment a little bit more i'm going to take mac fix+ and I'm going to spray my brush with it and then dip it back into the pigment and this is just really really going to intensify the eyeshadow it's going to make it more metallic and bring out like the topi undertone a lot more and then I got out of the frame a little bit but basically i just put it in my on my entire lid you get the gist going back into that tartlet palette I'm gonna take a right back into best friend and i'm going to apply this right into the crease and i'm using a very very precise like pointy blending brush it's kind of like a pencil brush and I really want a lot of the purple to be concentrated into the crease so that's why I'm using a pencil brush I'm just taking my time going back and forth and yeah after I do that I'm just going to blend everything out so there are no harsh lines I'm taking that fluffy blending brush again sigma e40 and I'm going to get right back into natural beauty and then I'm just gonna buff everything out into my crease I wanted some more purple in my crease but I didn't want it to look harsh i'm not i did into a cut crease or anything I just want everything to look nice and diffused and blown out then I'm going to take this shape called super mom and this is gonna be my highlight it's like a very like a light light light peachy pinky kind of color and it makes a really nice matte highlight under the brow bone and i'm going to take this milani I text perfection liquid liner in black and I'm going to start doing my wing the way that I really like to do it is I apply a super super thin layer as close to my lashes as possible and then I make it thicker as I go so I just make the base really really thin and then just

finish off i'm going to start my face before I finish off my eyes i'm priming my face using the Makeup Forever HD primer and then i'm going to go in with the Bourjois healthy mix serum foundation usually I would go for like a more full coverage foundation especially for prom but my skin was acting super sensitive and I wanted something that was like light weight on my face like I wanted my foundation to be a little bit more lightweight so that's why I'm using my favorite which is the Bourjois healthy mix serum I'm in the shade 52 i'm just applying that all over my face using a Real Techniques buffing brush and then with a real techniques like powder brush I'm going to go into the Bourjois healthy balance powder and i'm just going to powder my face a little bit stay away from my under eye area specifically because i'm going to go in with concealer next and i'm using it the Maybelline master concealed by a studio and on a Real Techniques contour brush i'm applying that

highlight with the concealer I'm gonna be setting that with mac emphasized powder this is a really nice brightening powder and it's good to set your under eyes if you want like a bright under eye effect which I do especially for night time we're going out i love the under eye to be nice and bright yeah now i'm going to go ahead and finish off the eyes i'm taking a sigma pencil brush and I'm going to dip it into natural beauty and i'm going to start smoking that on my lower lashes by the way i filmed this tutorial literally at three o'clock in the morning so that is why my eyes are so red i was dead tired but I really wanted to get this video for you guys because you know I didn't have a video on wednesday and i just wanted a video up but anyway I did that same pencil brush into the

gonna take the super dark purple in this palette it's called bombshell and i'm going to really smoke it out again with the same pencil brush and then i just applied the mascara and then I am done with the eyes so moving up to the face I am taking my girl lactic bronzer in the shape Cabo this is my favorite bronzer of all time and i'm using the Real Techniques multi tasking brush to just a bronze up my face for some reason my bronzer was kind of washed out on camera but like I had like an intense bronzing contraction you just couldn't really tell that much yes so I'm just contouring kind of and bronzing at the same time for blush I'm using this tart one called celebrated its like one of their new blushes and it is beautiful i love it it's a very very soft pink I'm not crazy for blush like in an intense blush look so this soft pink is so perfect with so many looks and then i'm going to highlight my face using the physicians formula i could open it up there you go shimmer strip in Miami strip my favorite highlighter of all time drugstore high-end it's my favorite and I'm just highlighting with I believe this is the waiver like paper highlighter brush and the brush I use to apply my blush with a mac one like the mac blush brush but yeah then i'm going to go ahead and finish off this look by doing a little lip combo here and my little lip liner broke a little bit this is a eight colour-pop lippie pencil in the shade skimpy and i'm just applying that to my entire lip but then i thought it was way too warm for this look so i'm going in with this next high voltage lipstick in the shade stone it's such a cool unique like beautiful nude they have a lot of gray to it I don't know it's really really pretty but yeah that completes this makeup look thank you guys so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the makeup I'm wearing this is using the anastacio shadow couture palette this is what it looks like I of course kept it to the very warm eyeshadows in this palette I really really loved this look actually did a good day when I was just getting ready and I post them on snapchat like why I really like how it turned out I should have filmed this tutorial and it got super requested after that i posted a picture of me wearing it on Instagram and pretty much everyone commented please do a tutorial on this look so that is what i'm doing right now I love it when I saw cells pallets like this because you get a ton of eyeshadows and they're like $35 I think so it's really good it's a lot of bang for your buck and the quality of the eyeshadows are really nice I really really love this palette it's probably my favorite one so far just because I just love these warm colors but then you have pops of color down here as well it is a little bit different than the look I posted on Instagram I made it just a little darker a little bit more Brown in my crease and stuff like that I just made a little bit more dramatic but i really love this look I wasn't going to post it because I do so many like chocolate looks but it was requested just keep that in mind if you comment like you do it looks like this all the time it was requested okay so yeah if you want to see how to get this look at this angels game while watching I primer of choice today is the mac 24 hour extended I base I just recently discovered this and it's probably one of the best eyeshadow primer is i have ever used going into the Anasazi palette i am taking soft peach and I'm packing this all over my entire lid just to set that I base we just put down now I'm going to take a fluffy crease brush this is from sephora i'm going to dip my brush into the shade morocco and I am packing this in my crease this is kind of like my transition shade and i'm putting this everywhere pretty much just slowly dipping the color dipping the brush back into the color and just intensifying it going back and forth until I wanted exactly how I want it yeah does it make sense taking another brush I'm going into the color fudge it's the chocolatey color in the palette and I'm putting this all over my entire lid bringing it right up to the crease now i'm gonna take this one I'm pretty sure it's called Bellini it's a really pretty peach this is just like a random eyeshadow brush from urban decay that i got in the electric palette but i like it to pack on eyeshadow so I'm putting this all over the lid on top of that fudge color then applying fix+ to the brush and I'm just intensifying that color even more because adding of the fixed plus really makes this eyeshadow like a peachy metallic finish so i wanted to add the fixed plus to intensify it then I'm going to take a brush really similar to the mac 217 it's like a tapered crease brush and I'm a taking I'm not taking the fudge color and i'm putting this directly into my crease I don't want it as sloppily as the Morocco shade I want to make sure that that Braun stays focused in the outer V of my eye and in my crease as well so I'm just slowly building that color going back in to Morocco I'm just blending everything out so that the lines aren't too too harsh I'm not just going to take a white eyeshadow to highlight my brow bone since there isn't an eyeshadow light enough in the Anasazi palette this is just a white eyeshadow from a little rock palette we use any eyeshadow you want i dip my brush into the shade noir just to apply it really close to my lashes so that it can look like I have some eyeliner I'm just smudging it there just for the you know effect of eyeliner so i'm going to move onto my face before I finish my eyes I'm taking this tiny little sample i got for a mac it is there strobe cream it came when like ordered something the other day and I loved it like I love this as a primer it just makes my face so do it i love it now i'm going to take my makeup forever ultra HD foundation and i'm applying this on my entire face using a Marc Jacobs brush you don't need this brush honestly it was way too expensive but I wasn't the one who bought it was a present but it's really amazing but I don't recommend it just because it's so so pricey there's tons of brushes that do the same thing so i'm just applying it because you know it was a gift from Danny huh so I'm just using it anyway yeah so I applied the ultra HD foundation all over my face I mean why 335 it's like more of my Tanner shade but we're making it work so i'm using the Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser this is in the shade affair and i'm using this underneath my eyes to cover up some dark circles and to highlight my face but to further highlight I'm taking the Mac prep and prime pen in yep wipe that off your nose and i'm using what is called but it's got like boost it's the yellow one and i'm using this to highlight on the rest of my face and I added a little bit more to the under eye area just to further bryson and then I'm just blending that in but i'm not using us a doorman lace brush surprised i know but my son always brush was really really dirty so i just use this one for more feet it's not as good but it got the job done you know so yes just I just blended that and you've seen me blend in my concealer about a million times but yes all right i'm setting my under eye concealer using this NYX HD powder in the shade banana it's like the yellow powder i love it I've been using it a lot and I really love it so I'm using an elf tapered brush to just blush - elf tapered brush to set my concealer i'm setting everywhere I put that concealer alright so let's finish these eyes I'm taking this flat sort of brush by Sigma and I'm taking fudge and i'm applying it really close to my lower lashes and then I'm going to take more and do the same thing but on the outer corners I'm not dragging it all the way in like I did with fudge and then I'm just going to take morocco and blend everything out with a pencil brush to smudge it real good make sure everything is nice and blended and a smoky so now for mascara I'm using my L'Oreal telescopic and I was like whoa did I break it but no it was just a packaging malfunction this is the telescopic carbon black and I'm just coding my top and bottom lashes with this you can do falsies but I just decided to skip it then I'm going to take this pencil brush and i applied mac fix+ to it and I'm gonna dip this brush into the pink champagne color adding fix plus it's up to this eyeshadow intensifies it by like a million it makes it super foil and metallic so i'm applying this to my inner corners to create a nice metallic pinky inner corner so this is the laura geller baked bronzer in medium and it looks so dark I was really scared the first time I used it but i'm using this real techniques multitask brush and if I focus my brush on the more whitish part of the bronzer actually really love the bronzer it blends really nicely because the baked product but it just looks so nice so I'm only using a little bit to warm up my skin I'm not trying to contour anything just adding a little bit of color to my face all right for blush I'm using Mac warm soul because it just goes so well with this eyeshadow look I love this blush it's so beautiful and yeah that's what I'm applying to my sheiks and when I posted this picture on Instagram i was using the jaclyn hill champagne pop Becca highlight but i decided to use something different so i'm just i went with the hard candy baked bronzer intiki and i'm applying this to mind the tops of my cheekbones and on my nose just to highlight my face because I love to highlight all right for lips i'm using this over a liquid lipstick in the shade sao paulo i don't want to say that now Paolo it's such a beautiful nude it's like amazing these liquid lipsticks are one of the best liquid lipsticks i have ever used seriously stunning i love them i highly recommend them so after that i'm applying this marc jacobs lip gloss and sugar sugar right on top and then I wanted my look to be a little bit more doing so i took this josie maran Nirvana hydrating treatment missed and applied it to my skin this isn't a setting spray it's more of a treatment but I like how it makes my makeup look so yes that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you in my next video hey guys so today's video is another tutorial using the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette I said that I would do a couple of tutorials using this palette so this is look numero dos it's a pretty dark bold smokey eye this is perfect for a night on the town and this look definitely calls for false lashes like it would look absolutely beautiful with false lashes but i'm not a false lashes expert guys not i'm not very good with false lashes I just I never wear them um I just use like a very thick volumizing mascara and it does the job I mean I'm just really happy with the way that this turned out I'm actually really really loving this palette and i don't know if i should say this yet I'm not going to okay I'm gonna say it i might like this more than my naked 2 palette I haven't had it long enough to say that but i'm really loving the undertones in these eyeshadows so much more than I thought I would by the way i do not do my entire face in this tutorial you probably can't tell but I'm like getting the flu i just know i know it's coming and I know that people are mainly worried about the eyeshadows not what's on the rest of my face but everything that is on the rest of my face right now will be in the description box so if you're interested in like lip color or something just check down there because it'll be okay I'm gonna stop talking about by the way thumbs up this video if you want to see more naked 3 palette tutorials the first thing i'm going to do is take my Urban Decay primer potion because at the base of money you can kind of slip off if I don't have a primer which is this this is the NYX jumbo pencil in the color black meat I'm just gonna line it really close to my lash line and then just blend it up with my fingers but i'm not going to be taking a pass the crease now i'm taking this color right here called nooner and i'm going to be buffing this into my crease I really just want to blend out that black bass we put down and a lot of the Black is just going to blend always can see it starts like coming off but I do go back and add some more black to that to the spots that kind of disappeared now i'm taking the color limit and i'm just going to add this to my crease as well and just make everything nice and blended now i'm taking the color dark side and going to go all over the lid but i'm not really going to take it past the trees i'm just going to be putting it up to the crease and right here i'm just cleaning because this kind of has a little bit of fallout I'm just cleaning up and getting like a nice little sharp edge now i'm taking the color liar and I'm gonna be bluffing this into my crease this is just going to blend it really nicely from that dark side color to the matte shade in the crease I really like how it looks even though it is a shimmery color and then i'm taking burnout and i'm going to be doing the exact same thing for some reason I just think that these colors look really pretty together and like I don't know it's a good nice little transition then i'm taking my master drama eyeliner and midnight master and I'm going to line my waterline and then for my Bravo highlight i am just taking the color strange and i'm putting that in my tear duct as well and then I'm just adding some eyeliner to make that little winged liner and I do it off camera because they have to get super close to the mirror and then you just not be able to see me then I'm taking the color liar and i'm just going to buff this underneath my lower lash line just to kind of smoke it out and then I'm gonna soften the outer edges of that wing with that same eyeshadow and then I'm just going to pack on the mascara this tutorial was super quick and easy anybody could do it even a beginner so i really hope you enjoyed thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already and I see you in my next one hey guys so today's video and makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right now I wanted to play around with the new color pop colors for spring like a really pretty mint ocean turquoise and an insane blue and honestly this is very similar to look I've done in the past with different colors I even did a look very similar to this with color pops weenie and Porter but i just love this kind of our looks like the halo I where you have like a lighter shade in the middle it's one of my favorite techniques to use I do look like this all the time I just switch up the colors so yeah I wanted to play around with the new color pop colors these are available already and and ok so i tried the braids I love this hairstyle i love this since I was a little girl it reminds me so much of Miss hold up I've said this before in a video I feel but it reminds me of a little girl who miss Trent Boult throws over the fence by her braids by her pigtails even though hers weren't like this in the movie she just had like a regular break anyway Nicole Guerriero uploaded a tutorial on how to do this so i tried my best and I followed a long hair tutorial but I feel like I just suck I cannot do hair I suck so if you're frustrated because you can't do here with the same you and I you and I with the same but anyway if you want to see how to get this makeup tutorial right here then just keep watching ok so oddly enough i'm starting off with my face I never do i always start off with my eyes but we'll go with it this is the skin and Naevia primer spray and I'm just sprang that on my face and I'm going in with the new foundation this is the josie maran vibrancy argan oil foundation this is in the shade cause make and I'm liking it I think it's really nice sometimes I feel like it sits on top of the skin I need to play with it a little bit more but it's nice and dewy and I like it so far it's not my favorite but i really like it so far so far underneath my eyes I'm using the Catrice waterproof camouflage concealer i'm applying this underneath my eyes cover up them dark circles and i'm also applying this to my eyelids to prime for the eyeshadows and i'm just going to be blending that in with my Beauty Blender to set all that creaminess down I'm taking my RC may know color powder and i'm using this is sephora 47 brush to set my under eye concealer and pretty much set everywhere else I applied concealer as well i also took this wet and wild stippling brush and just dusted some of that powder on the rest of my face i'm going in with a bronzer that i have been loving so much ever since I tried it this is the to face sweetheart bronzer in the shade sweet tea i love it because it has a machinery site and Matt side and when you combine them you get a beautiful bronze glow i'm applying this with my way of a 90 brush one of the best bronzer brushes in my opinion love it so now i'm going to go ahead and start on my eyes I'm using the makeup eyeshadow and beaches and cream and i'm applying this into my crease with the morphe e23 brush and then i'm going in with makeup geek creme brulee and i'm also applying this into the crease but a little bit more precisely in the crease and i'm using the morphe m4 for one brush to apply that just going back and forth and i'm going in with this stunning amazing colour by colour pop this is one of their new super shock shadows for spring it's in the shade luckily and i'm applying this now with the marc jacobs brush but honestly this is the kind of eye shadow that applies the best with your fingers and you'll see here in a second but first I am taking make a peek bedrock and i'm just using this eyeshadow to kind of blend out the edges of that blue and i'm going to take anastacio Beverly Hills eyeshadow in the shade farm with the same brush I'm using an e 28 by morphy and I'm just blending this into the crease so you get a nice gradient from the blue - like the warm brown here's what i'm talking about this eyeshadow looks stunning once you start applying it with your fingers I find that some color pop shadows do look great with a synthetic brush but this shape specifically apply with your fingers I'm taking this Luxy 229 brush remember dipping it into luckily and then buffing this into the crease this is just going to make everything blend better I went back into fond and blended that some more but just go back and forth with these two shades and make sure there are no harsh lines huh excuse me I went back into creme brulee by makeup geek and just dusted that into my crease and now i'm going to take this beautiful color pop shadow in the shade of a flower shop and with my finger I am just applying this right to the center of my eyelid i'm going to try to blend that out a little bit with my finger as you see here but i'm just going back and forth with the navy blue shade and back with my finger and just blending things out you'll get the hang of it once you try it yourself now i'm going in with this stunning amazing kat von d eyeshadow it's called electric warrior and i'm applying that right on top of flower shop I want to just a little bit more green in this look a little more teal I'm taking white lies by make a peek and applying that and my brow bone to highlight and then I'm going to take Mac nylon and apply it to my inner corners and then go in with makeup aight voltage right on top so to line my waterline and mai thailand used color pops worth it's just a black shade but I think I do like my next one the best i'm going in with this tiny little brush this is the zoeva 240 brush and I'm applying makeup geeks peacock right to my lower lash line that's why this pencil brush is perfect for that because it's so tiny and now i'm going to apply some mascara and go in with these lashes i bought these on Amazon i just searched demi wispies and then this came out and I decided to buy it because it came in a pack and i love them amazing so anyway i'm going in with the blush and this is Milani baked blush in Luminoso a really pretty peachy blush and now to highlight my face i'm actually going to take an eye shadow this is the Milani Bella eyes eyeshadow in the shade Bella chiffon it's such a pretty like white gold and for my lips I went in with the Anasazi liquid lipstick in the shade naked it's really pretty but it got a little bit crusty on the inside of my

you guys enjoyed it was really simple but not simple at the same time I really hope you liked it please subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on me make up i'm wearing right now this is the look I was wearing in my favorite makeup brushes video and it was highly requested it looks a little darker today for some reason i guess because my tee shirt is black and I was wearing very light colors that day somewhere then it looks a little darker but it's literally the exact same look I was wearing in that video so if you want to see a tutorial on the look I was going in the video then the routines i am using a bunch of random different eye shadows for this look but you can use whatever similar eyeshadows you have at home and it'll probably turn out pretty much the same so really quickly i want to mention because i know people are going to tell me i know this look is it like a daytime smokey eye this no this isn't for everybody this is probably way too much eye makeup for a lot of people and like I said on camera for some reason it looks a lot darker than what it looks like in person but it's not that serious guys it's just makeup and sometimes it's fun to be a little bold and edgy like right now all I'm missing is my guitar and got the look going on so anyway I just wanted to say that yeah it's not for everybody but some people like this look so I try to do different things for different people so if you want to see how to get this look just so the first thing I'm going to do is a prime my eyelids with Lorax behind the scenes eye primer and I'm going to take that all the way up to my brow bone then I'm going to take the color tattoo in pomegranate punk and it's this really pretty like cranberry purple and i'm going to apply this really close to my lash line I'm not even gonna put this like on my entire litter anything next I'm taking cork by mack on the fluffy blending brush and I'm just going to be applying this into my crease as my transition color I'm really not being specific with this I'm just leaven that all over my crease and i'm going to take a flat shader brush with this eyeshadow called Galapagos it's from NARS you can use any brown you want and i'm going to apply this to my entire bit by the way this look is going to look a little messy before it looks good it's one of those looks that you really have to blend a lot and then it turns out nice in the end now i'm just taking some of that cork I used earlier and i'm going to apply this into my crease with my - 17 and I'm just trying to blend these colors out a little bit more but we will go back to that and do some more blend and later on now i'm taking maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master it's just a nice dark black and I'm going to tight line with this and i'm also going to apply this to my waterline now with my mac 217 I'm gonna take this color called co-star it's from a two faced natural at night palette but honestly any dark warm chocolate color will work for this this was just my favorite so I'm applying that into my crease with my - 7 and start blending away like i said this look requires lots and lots of blending yeah now i'm taking my gel eyeliner and i'm going to start smudging that on my upper lash line you don't want to be precise with this at all since we are going to be like smudging it away pretty much so you can be sloppy now with the tiny little brush I'm going to dip it into some black eyeshadow and then i'm going to use that to help smudge the gel eyeliner and i'm going to go back in with Galapagos and then i'm going to apply it on top just so that the black and blend into the brown a little bit more it's kind of like an ombre I don't want it to be like a black line and then Brown I wanted to fate now i'm going back into court and on my fluffy blending brush I'm going to start you guessed it blending at this point you just really really want to take your time and blend it and buff it this is the part that takes the longest just making sure that it looks kind of like it fades up and it's like a gradient from dark to a light brown now i'm just going to apply my mascara to my top lashes and then finish the rest of my face so that i can finish the bottom part of my eyes as my primary i'm using the Maybelline Baby skin instant poori racer when you have such dark colors on your eyes you want to make sure that you're using a full coverage foundation just like an look like it's a flawless and there's not a lot of redness because then it'll look like grungy and weird so i am using the Maybelline know the revlon colorstay with foundation and i am using this on a real techniques expert face brush to buff it all out yeah rendering my eyes I want something that's also a full coverage since the eyes are so dark and i'm using max pro longwear concealer everything that i'm using will be in the description box by the way if you are interested in what shade or whatever that will be down below and then I'm just going to set that with my msf natural I need one a little bit lighter I need to buy one but yeah now i'm going to take cork again and I'm going to use this on a pencil brush to smudge it underneath my eyes and then apply my mascara so for the rest of my face the bronzer i'm going to be using is NARS Laguna and I'm just gonna just pretty much bronze my whole face i'm not going to be too precise with this i'm not going to do like a strong contour anything yeah yeah for my blush I'm using Mac's margin and it's a really nice like pinky peach color I'm using this on the duo fiber brush because it doesn't deposit that much blush so I don't want something really strong i just want something to look like nice and pitching nice and then for my lips i am using Maybelline's blushing beige lipstick and then that's it that completes this look for you guys i really hope you enjoyed it please subscribe if you haven't already

eyes really close to my lashes ok so I'm going to move onto my face before I finished my eyes i'm priming my face with Olivia hydration essence primer I'm still testing it out I don't know how I feel about it I definitely like the post shave balm a lot more so for my foundation i'm mixing together the maybelline fit me matte and poreless and the Bekaa luminous foundation so for concealer i'm using my Maybelline a better skin concealer and I am just applying this to my eyes you've seen me do this about a trillion times you know underneath my eyes and me to my eyebrows on the nose and the chin

my next video toodles ok so i felt a tutorial for the look i'm wearing right now it is like a bronzy but like a pinky bronzy look um I always do wings liner all the time either with gel or with liquid liner I just I've always done that but I did something a little bit different in this tutorial that haven't done in a while and i just i love how it turned out and I hope you guys do - okay so if you want to see how to get this look then please keep watching ok so I've already done my eyebrows and I heard this I eyebrows have not been cooperating with me lately so don't look at them ok so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my Urban Decay primer potion this is just a little baby in the old packaging about this forever last pretty long time i would say and i'm just going to put this all over my lid all the way to the bone and then kind of run it on my lower lashes a little ok so the first of the two only eyeshadows i'm going to be using is called cork it's my mac and it's just like a just like a browns a really nice crease color and I'm taking on this fluffy brush this is a sigma e40 but any like really big fluffy brush will be fine and i am just going to work that into my crease I'm going to do it really lightly and just build up the color I'm going to go back and forth into this color cork and just build it up a little by little but i'm also going to be putting some of the color on the outer V just like rubbing it in and then bringing it into the crease ok so now it's my favorite part is the lid color and what I'm going to be using is max pigment and tan I have been obsessed with this I use this and everything and makes it with my bronzer to give like more glow to my face sometimes it actually was on my accent nail right here like my nail polish this color right here is just some of the ten pigment and then I put a clear top coat on it so I mean this is a multi-purpose little pigment any all the pigments on but i've been loving loving loving this color it's amazing so I'm just taking the top I'm like kind of mixing it and using whatever product is on the top so I'm just going to take my mac 239 brush and I'm just gonna pack this all over my entire life I'm going to take the same brush for the like this and kind of bring some into the crease just a tiny tiny bit like that like a tiny bit so I'm going to take my fix plus now i am going to spring my brush why it always freaks me out every time I swear that i'm going to dip it into the pigment and put this all over my lid again the fix plus really intensifies the shadow and gives it more like a metallic look and this is really just going on the lid I'm not bringing it into the crease at all ok so now I'm going to work on the lower lash line a little bit and I'm going to take the same brush kind of dry it off and i'm going to dip it into the pigment and I'm only picking up a little bit on the very tip of the brush like I'm not putting it on the actual brush like this it's just on the very tip I'm picking up a very small amount and i'm going to run that really close to my waterline now i'm just going to go back to my fluffy brush and back to that cork eyeshadow that we use in the crease and I'm going to do the same thing like the first step i did i'm going to do it all over again not so much though just going to try to blend this out a little more and bring some depth to the other be ok I know it seems like a lot of steps but it's really quickly when you're doing it on your own it's literally two eyeshadows it's just that I'm trying to explain it but really if you're doing this on your own it's your done in a second now i'm just taking a pencil brush this is a sigma e30 and I'm gonna dip it back Oh different right back into this cork color and we're gonna blend out the tan pigment on the lower lash line this part takes a little bit of time you just have to sit there and kind of blend so it looks nice and smoked out ok so once I've done that I'm just going to line my waterline i am using brown because i don't want it to be super harsh i don't want to be like very black I like this to look a little chocolaty and bronzy from any sense so I'm using the keyless much stick waterproof eyeliner in damsel this comes in the ELA in the light palette it's like the most beautiful chocolate brown color and it stays on your waterline all day so I'm just going to line my waterline with this and then i'm going to tight line as well ok so now i am going to do this little smoked out eyeliner so basically I'm just going to be drawing a line right here like if I were doing a liquid liner or something but pretty sloppy because it doesn't matter you I'm going to be blending that out in a second this drives pretty quickly so I've got to work quickly I'm just going to take this this is an eyebrow brush that I got from coastal sense but i use it like some gel eyeliner it's amazing for that so now i'm just gonna smoke this out just want to go back and forth until it's pretty smoked out and it kind of blends in with that tan pigment ok so now that i'm done blending this is what it looks like it's kind of like a diffused liner and it's a lot more natural than having a gay black liquid liner or don't line or something like that ok so now we're going to kind of do the same thing on the lower lash line only I'm not adding any more eyeliner I'm just gonna kind of smudge what's already there so I'm just going to start blending this oh I'm using a pencil brush and stead of this one because this one can be a little harsh for your under eyes I'm using a pencil brush I'm getting really close to the water line that time smudging it down kind of ok so for my brow bone highlight and like my inner corner highlight I'm just going to take like a cream colored shadow I don't want anything shimmery since there's so much sugar on the lids you can if you're doing this look you can go ahead and do something humor if you want to tweet you don't I just don't like to have something so shimmery under my brow bone when I have something should be on the lips ok so i'm just going to take my while Danny pallets color right here I don't know what it's called they know they sell this color separately when a while sell it separate e and if you find it i really suggest you get it's like the best most pigmented cream-colored highlight color yeah so I'm just going to take this on my pencil brush and put this underneath my eyebrow and I'm going to take it into my - your duck as well and now i'm just going to add my mascara i am using my clinic / doubling mascara for my top lashes and i'm using my illegal length by Maybelline mascara on my bottom lashes and i will be right back okay and this is the finished I look I personally love it and now i'm going to move to my face ok so for the face i'm going to keep it pretty simple not going to do anything crazy at all i have already primed right face with the team relief powder job and I kind of touched up some little pimple areas i put some concealer over them and to do that i use the gabby consider I got in my ofc bag last month ok so you guys are actually going to witness me using the Beauty Blender for the very first time as you can see it's like bright neon kind of hurts your eyes a little bit because i have never used it before it's been like to know yeah it's like two weeks since i bought it and i haven't used it yet i don't know why i guess because I don't want to do it and that's really sweet but i gotta just wait for the first time right now and like I felt to expand in the palm of my hand and I thought it was the coolest thing I don't know that anybody else experience that when different about this it's literally like this big and came out this big but it's tiny and then it just like expands in your hand when you like switching the water out it's so cool to me oh no you know that's really dorky but I found that really cool ok so I'm going to see how well this works so this is kind of like my first impressions on it in this tutorial so i'm going to be using my L'Oreal True Match Lumi i have come to the conclusion that this is my holy grail foundation after my black colors day they're kind of tied I want this stuff is amazing i love it the more i use this the more I hate my trouble on your naked foundation but anyway so i guess i'm just going to bounce this into my foundation put this on my face yeah this is fun for some reason I camera this kind of looks like it's a little too dark for me but this I don't know why looks like that on camera doesn't look like that in my mirror that's it for me this is awesome because story whenever I use like my foundation brush which might like amazing holy grail foundation brush is the Sigma angled kabuki the f-84 and love that not even my real techniques expert face brush is as good as that one and i thought it would be but it isn't but you have to sit there and kind of blend it for a while this kind of just puts on your foundation perfectly like perfectly and I feel like it doesn't drink up a lot of the product either like you know like those little cheap triangle sponges that you get like a target the stuff I used for my foundation on with that all the time when I was younger and that like just drank up the liquid and it's crazy that this one doesn't because it's a sponge well I guess the when you are dampen it kind of let that happen but ok so this little guy is amazing and i don't know if you can tell but i feel like when i use this sponge as opposed to my brush gives me more like a dewy finish this is a foundation that gives you a new we finish but I feel like with my brush my stuff it in I don't get like the dizziness of the foundation I mean not really not as much as this I don't know if you can see it like my face is glowing over here I don't know i love this but the real test i'm going to put to the test right now is how well it blends out my consider underneath my eyes cuts that's what's important to me so pumped a tiny bit of my mac pro longwear concealer on the back of my hand and I to pop this and like a triangle shape ok oh I'm in the shade and w 15 mile away you're wondering okay let's see ok so my memory card got full so i had to go take the memory card output in the computer that's how I know that this video is probably way too long because my memory card never gets full before i finish filming it usually gets fully when I'm done you know so right so yeah well i was uploading the footage footage yeah I guess you were calling footage into my computer i set my under eye concealer with my msf natural in mediums my favorite place ever but yeah I think you blend it out amazingly like just like flawlessly like this honestly it's flawless its twenty dollars it's crazy but I think that it just applies your makeup amazing right it doesn't look on my forehead it doesn't look like a foundation on that's insane ok so like i said earlier I'm not gonna do anything crazy to my face and my dark like the Sun comes and goes and that's what sets of our natural lighting just like whatever mother nature wants to piss you off at will so I'm gonna take my contouring blush and bronzing powder i have been loving this I'm recently I like it a lot more for the summer because i know this is a pretty deep this is a pretty deep bronzer and it doesn't look good when I like really white I've got in got a little bit darker i was at the pool couple days ago and I've been self tanning a little bit so I'm a little darker so yeah I'm going to be using my Real Techniques blush brush well I love this brush is amazing kind of comes to like a tip too . okay stop talking campaign and get on with it this is why I do get ready with me videos this is why I'm going to be talking to you for hours I was the kid in elementary school that sees in conduct ok so i'm just going to be pressing it into the browser and typing it out this thing is so crazy pigmented know how many times I've gotten like a spot of bronzer ridiculous so yeah I am just going to be bronzing around my face just kind of give some like warmth around my face don't like bronzer like all over the face i used to do that a lot when I was your group that was so in denial because my nickname in school with comfort so it's like bronze my whole face I do that I don't like that but yeah so I'm just going to like softly contour it looks a little scary right now but I just blend it out ok so once I've got that down i'm just gonna take off and he bronzed around the tip of my brush and I'm going to apply the blush ok so that's all I'm really doing to the face nothing too crazy just a little bit of bronzer little bit of blush that's it for my lips I'm using this NYX butter gloss actually bought this yesterday and I tried it on and I was like oh my god i found love with it i'm not a lip gloss person i own i think like to lip glosses I just I've never liked them it's amazing amazing some may say oh my god thank you can get mad at me there this is in the color creme brulee I thought to try it out this was just a nice basic color and I actually love it so yeah yeah it's pretty okay going you can build this up to get a really ok lip color but I just 11 pretty ok so now i'm just going to add my finishing touch my little magic bad boy right here and mac fix+ just gonna let that dry

check now it is officially fall and I love this time of year especially for makeup because it's all about the warm colors and you know I like warm colors today's video is a fun one because it is a collab with one of my great friends here on YouTube Laura her name is mrs. Lowell in on youtube and we both had the great idea to do a look surrounding the oprah long lasting liquid lipstick in Miami fever which you guys know is the color I created with Oprah we thought it would be awesome to surround our tutorial with this color she has blonde hair and I have well a lot of people i would I like to think I'm blonde I like to think I'm blood but I'm brunette I mean I'm a brunette but I trick people it's like oh you're blonde oh you're a brunette it was so highly requested from you guys to do a bunch of looks using Miami fever so of course i'm doing one for you and laura is going to do one for you as well she's really really awesome and very big on energy is like when I'm around someone and the vibes are good i just feel good and she gives off good luck anyway I don't want to rebel i will link Laura's video below make sure you go and show her some love and subscribe this look is using my morphe 35o palette this was also so requested a lot of you guys were like why haven't you both Cesaro using that and it's just because it's so constantly out of stock i don't like to upset anyone but i did use that palette for this look today it's a very messy brown smokey eye so anyone can do this look absolutely anyone it's just really just a messy brown smokey eye nothing too fancy or too complicated so i feel like i've been talking for like 0 minutes already if you want to see how to get this makeup look right here then just keep watching ok so I am jumping into eyeshadow since my eyes are already primed I'm taking this really light warm shade in the palette I hate that none of these have names but I mean the entire palette is warm and full of orange colors but i'm just taking a light shade in the palette and using this in my crease now i'm taking this dark matte Brown this brown has a lot of red to it so it's like a very reddish brown and i'm applying this on my entire lid yeah I'm going to go into this mid tone brown shade and on a small little crease brush I am just applying that into my crease just so that I can blend those brown colors together now i'm going to take a darker brown this one isn't as red as the 1i used before and it's a little bit deeper so on a flat shader brush I am just applying this to my entire lid just to deepen up the look i wanted something a little bit darker now I'm going to take this orange color and on that same little crease brush we used earlier i am applying this into my crease to really really warm up the look i wanted the crease to look like very orangie so that as well as it and then I just took a big fluffy brush just to blend out any harsh edges I took this shimmery like light champagne pinky shade and i applied this underneath my brow bone to highlight now i'm taking a black eyeliner this one is from nicks it's their specially like saying that or attempting to say that and I tight line with this and then I applied it really close to my lashes and smudged it out with a pencil brush you can use winged eyeliner but i wanted something a little bit more messy and smudge looking and then I just went right back into that deep matte brown shade and applied applied it to my lid all over again okay i'm going to take this like neon peach shade and i'm going to lightly dust this into my crease and this is really going to make it look go from zero to a hundred in terms of warmth it's really gonna warm things up so i'm going to move on to the rest of my face before I finish up my eyes as I usually do and i'm using the Maybelline Baby skin Oh taking a sip of my sparkling water but I use my baby skin and support your acer as a primer and then i'm using the Makeup Forever HD stick foundation i'm going to give you guys a quick little review because you guys wanted to know my thoughts on this I love this it's amazing this is like the first stick foundation that actually works for dry skin believe it or not because it does have like a very sat in natural finish a lot of people say it's like a dewy finish but I find it a little bit more at least on my dry skin it's not as doing it's a little bit more like natural and this color is a shade too dark for me I've gotten very fair / you know the past few weeks but it is a little bit too dark for me but let's try to look past it i'm going to take my Maybelline fit me concealer in 15 fair and i'm applying this underneath my eyes not only to hide my dark circles but to highlight my face and I'm also highlighting other parts of my face as well i'm blending all that in with my Real Techniques contour brush and of course to make sure that my concealer does increase I'm setting it with my NYX HD powder in the shade button up banana mama mama ok so to finish off the eyes i'm taking this next eyeliner in the shade golden bronze and i just use that on my waterline and then I took that same crease shade we used in the beginning of the tutorial well I'm going really fast and I just blended that under my lower lash line and then i just use the same highlight shade under my brow bone on my inner corners ok ok so this shadow is magical it's one of the new kat von d eyeshadows it's amazing it's in the shade dose go say it's amazing so I just blended that underneath my lower lashes and then I took that same matt brown and I just deepen out the outer corner with that so I wanted like a metallic green e gold so I went into my uh Nastasia world travel a pallet traveler palette and i took the shade metallic and I applied it to my lower lash line and my inner tear duct and a little bit on my top lid as well and i just put on some clinic mascara and I was going to apply falsies but I i kind of like to look without policies but you know you do whatever you want so to contour my face i'm using my physicians formula bronzer in the shade medium I think it's the bronze booster bronzer and I think it's the medium shade so I'm just contouring with this but not like a very harsh contour anything mainly just warming up my face and also trying to add some runs onto my neck since my face didn't quite match my neck all that much so I took off my little heart ears and i'm applying some highlight this is the echo champagne pop highlighter and i'm highlighting my face and I decided to highlight before blush today and I don't know why so I went into this elf palette this is the light blush palette and i took the really warm pinchy pinchy No peachy shade and I just decided to stamp that on my face and of course finishing off the look with the Miami fever liquid lipstick that completes this makeup look thank you guys so much for watching I really hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye no he isn't hey guys so let me address something really quick my dad decided to play his guitar right when I want to sit down and film the intro of this video and let's try to look past that ok so the music didn't stop so hey guys and this is gonna be a voiceover intro I wanted to say a couple of things so today's video is going to be a drugstore makeup tutorial a full-face drugstore makeup tutorial on this look right here I wanted to do something really really easy like for beginners simple every single day type of thing so this is what I came up with i am using the wet and wild pilot in no filter i believe this is what it's called it's from the fergie line and mainly using that bronzy pink color which by the way is really similar to max tan pigment just saying oh and my brows I want to touch base on them really quickly i use my elf eyebrow kit so i did use something from the drug store as well only I didn't film it because I take forever to do my brows and I like this but I think it makes my brows just a little bit darker than I'd like I really like bold eyebrows and you guys know it but i like it to come off a little bit more warm and not as dark as this but I use this from time to time and yeah I just wanted to tell you guys that so that you don't comment down below like a eyebrows are scary I know guys I know so yeah like I said this look is super easy anybody can do it I mean it's really really simple and so if you want to see how to get this drugstore makeup look then just keep watching so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take my milani brow I highlighter and i'm going to use the matte side and i'm going to apply this underneath my eyebrows and just blend it out with my fingers and then add this to the inner part of my eye as well next I'm taking my maybelline color tattoo in the shade barely branded and i'm going to use this to prime my eyes and use it as a base for the eyeshadow i'm going to put down yeah I'm going to line my waterline and my tight line with Maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master as per usual the eyeshadow i'm going to be using is from this one and wild palette and I'm using that pinky bronze color of the corner and i'm going to wet my brush with 6 plus before I dip it into the eye shadow just to intensify it a bit and then I'm just going to pack this all over my lid to blend out the harsh lines i'm going to take this matt brown from this next love in Paris palette because the brown in the wedding on a pallet is too dark for the crease so I'm going to take that on a mac 217 and just blend out the edges this look is pretty simple and soft so I don't want to go too crazy with anything in the crease next I'm going to take this lighter shade in the palette and I'm going to use this to highlight underneath my brow bone this color isn't very pigmented it's the only one in the palette that doesn't have a lot of pigment to it which is why i put down that milani base first next I'm going to take my jordana fabric liner in black and I'm just going to add a little wing not to sin or not too thick or anything like that I got too close to the mirror and then I got out of focus because i wasn't paying attention development focus or not so yeah you don't have to add a wing but i just wanted to i'm going in with my L'Oreal voluminous carbon black mascara and my Maybelline the rocket volume right on top I'm going to move on to the rest of my face and I'm using my heart candy sheer envy primer to prime my face yeah the foundation I'm using is my revlon colorstay foundation in 250 medium beige i want to say i haven't it in the description box but i think it's 250 I kept smelling my foundation because i just realized how good this foundation smells and I never noticed it no yeah that's why i'm selling my lunch but i'm using this on my Real Techniques sponge and it looks like i'm stamping my face pretty hard but I'm not just the fast forward effect that I guess then I'm going to go in with my Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade 5 fair and i'm going to use this to cover up my dark circles and highlight underneath my eyes a little bit I'm going to blend that out with my ELF pointed foundation brush to set that I'm going to use my Maybelline fit me powder in 135 creamy natural and i'm just going to use this to set my concealer underneath my eyes to prevent it from creasing and I didn't get a lot of sleep that night so all the night before so my dark circles were pretty bad even with concealer over them let's just ignore that I'm going to take the dark brown and be wet and wild palette and on a tiny little brush I'm going to smudge this really really close to my waterline then with a pencil brush I'm going to go back into that color we used in our crease and i'm just going to blend out the dark brown just so that it looks nice and blended and smoked out I'm going to move on to the rest of my face i'm using my physicians formula bronze booster and i'm just going to bronze up my face a little bit like I said this is a really simple day-to-day look so I don't want to contour anything like that i'm using my ELF complexion brush I believe that's what it's called I'm just gonna warm up my skin a little bit take it on my neck and all that jazz and then I realized I didn't put mascara on my bottom lashes so yeah anyway I'm going to move on to my blush i love this blush this is from pixie and it's called healthiest honey and it's just like a warm peach it's really really pretty i love it just like from day to day because it gives some warmth to my cheeks actually got this blush I'm marshals for like two dollars which I no pixie is pretty expensive at target so I love this blush moving on to my lips i am using my revlon matt baume in the color elusive and i'm just going to put a light layer of this all over my lips and then i'm going to top it off with a lip gloss and i am using the NYX butter gloss and fortune cookie just to lighten it up a little bit I thought it was a little bit too pink so this is just making it more milkier version of that color and that is it that is the end of this really simple fast day-to-day drugstore tutorial i really hope you enjoyed

of red to this Oh what I don't know ok and i am using this as my transition shade this shade is really important for the other channels we were putting down and it does take a little bit of building i have to work with this eyeshadow a little bit because it's not as creamy as the rest of them but once you do you get a nice reddish brown color now i'm gonna take this eyeshadow from colour-pop it's called mittens it's a really really like reddish deep kind of brown I'm singing throughout this whole video I was feeling my playlist anyway i'm applying this my entire lid i love this color it's so gorgeous so i'm applying this all the way up to my crease not really passing my crease so much just applying it as an all over the lid shade I'm going to go back into that Brown that reddish brown from the palette and I'm going to start to blend this color this part takes a long time it's like a process because we are I'm trying to mix these two colors really well and blend them together nicely so just go back and forth it just takes a while but it you get there eventually I'm taking grandstand from the new mega be spoiled eyeshadows it's amazing as you can see by my reaction and on a flat shader brush I'm going to apply this mainly to the center of my lid like a right dab in the middle so that a lot of light can reflect to that part of the eye and i'm going to start applying and animals are blending it into the mittens color a little bit just working my brush around so that it's not just a stark line of that color does that make sense you see me you see me you see me working at mainly in the center of the lid going back into mittens i'm just going to deepen out the outer part of my eyelid and my crease a little bit and then freaking out because I think the UPS man was there for me anyway and then I'm going to keep it out the inner corner as well i kind of want to keep the main focus of the grandstand I title right in the center as you can you said it a million times going right back into that reddish brown and i'm just going to further blend everything out some more take your time with this and kind of blend everything together I'm going to take this cream color again and i'm going to apply this underneath my brow bone and i'm also going to apply this to the inner part of my eye as well and then to further highlight because that doesn't give me enough i

the crease then I'm going to take this fluffy brush the same morphe brush and I'm dipping it back into that desert sand color and I'm gonna rub this back and forth into my crease and what this is gonna do is gonna blend the roulette shade and kind of help it melt into the desert sand shades a little bit now this look doesn't require fix+ but i just wanted to add just a little bit to intensify it just a little bit more this eyeshadow is very pigmented on its own but i just added a little bit of fix plus a little bit of pizzazz then with this Ecotools brush I'm taking me fluffy side because it's a dual ended brush and I'm going to dip it right back into desert sands and I'm just gonna start packing this into my crease i'm using a smaller crease brush to make it a little bit more precise in the crease i'm going to take mirage and this is gonna be my brow bone highlight this color is so pigmented i love it and I'm going to take a little wipe and I'm going to clean up the edges like I usually do make it a little bit sharp at the edges you can always use tape but I just clean it I'm gonna take this Stila eyeliner in the shape damn so i believe and I'm going to tight line with this and I'm going to use this as my water on my waterline as well this is just a brown eyeliner then I'm going to take the pigment called liquid gold this is also from makeup geek this is a super intense green gold pigment like really intense and I'm gonna put in my inner corner kind of like any little triangle shape and make it look sharp does that make sense well you see it's like a little triangle and then I'm gonna add a link to the outer part of my I kind of like where you would normally put eyeliner just a little bit different i guess that makes sense i'm never good at explaining but you can see here huh i'm going to take my Jessie's Girl liquid eyeliner and just add a little flick you guys know every time I try to do an eyeliner on-camera I get way too close to the mirror and get a frame but here I'm just priming my face before I finish up my eyes and I'm using my cover effects calming primary to do that then I'm gonna put on some foundation and i forgot to show it to you this is the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Foundation in the shade 40 and I love this foundation it's definitely one of my favorite drugstore foundations I'm just gonna bump that all of my face using a zlpha brush yeah then I'm gonna add some under-eye concealer this is the Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser in the shade fair and i'm just adding like that triangle-shaped highlight as well to further highlight i am taking the Maybelline magic Lumi pen I believe that's what is called magic Lumi pen and i'm just going to highlight my face even more on my nose my forehead around my mouth you know the places where you would normally highlight and then I'm just gonna blend that out with the same foundation brush I'm actually gonna take this product here this is the NARS contour powder in Paloma it also comes with a highlight shade that's completely matte so I'm going to take that highlight shade and i'm going to set my under eye concealer with this thank you to everyone who said that this brush was perfect for setting my under eye concealer because I was like oh I don't like this brushes too little for blush but you guys were like no I use that brush to set my under eye concealer and it works great this is the elf blush brush and you guys are the best i'm going to highlight the tops of my cheekbones with this mac cream-colored base in the shade pearl and i'm just using my fingers to stipple this on my face because it is a cream product going back to finish off my eyes I'm just going to smoke out the lower lash line out taking that bottle being shade with the other side of that equal tools brush and I'm just applying it to my lower lash line to even out the look and make it a smokier and then I'm going to take desert sands and further smoke it out then I'm going to add some bottom mascara well mascara to my bottom lashes and i use the Maybelline latch discovery mascara to do that and then i'm going to go ahead and just take that same nars paloma contour powder and then i'm going to contour my face and this is a oliva gonna grab it it is a zoeva 101 brush and that is what I'm using to contour my flights by the way i also added mascara to my top lashes and i forgot to record that but I used the mac and extreme dimension 3d black lash mascara I'm trying to give my lashes that break from policies for a little while let's see how long that lasts but I've been on a no falsies kick for a while now well like a couple weeks the blush I'm using is this NYX blush in terracotta it's become a new obsession i love it it's a nice bronzy warm beautiful peachy amazing blush then to finish off my look I'm gonna take this girl lactic lipstick in the shade naked and I'm just gonna stamp this on my lips a little bit just so not that much pigment comes off this is the base color and then I'm going to take this Nick soft matte lip cream in Cairo and i'm just going to put this on top and it's gonna make it even more nude cairo by itself is a little bit too nude or like adding the lipstick with it it's a nice little combo ok guys so that completes this look the US so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here it's more of a night time look a lot of mobs i am using the morphe 35o t palette i posted this palette on snapchat a while ago because I got in the mail and was like immediately in love with this palette it's so so good it has similar colors to like the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette you know in that color family Rosie bronzes Rosie bronzes like a bunch of gold there's a bunch of bronzy warm colors but then there's a ton of pinky cranberry purple shades so i did go with the cranberry modish kind of look today but you can do

since I was like ten there we go and i'm going to start on my eyes I'm using the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer one of my favorite drugstore primers i would say i got it at Jessie's Girl cosmetics com now i'm going to take this la girl LA girl Pro prime this is like a skin tone color well my skin tone a little bit like it and i'm just using this to cover up all the veins on my eyelids and act as a base but i do need to set that base so I'm taking this little lorac Pro matte palette and I'm using the one of the shade closest to my skin tone to set that base so that there are no tackiness when I apply the eyeshadows ok so I'm taking this first color in the palette and I'm using a fluffy brush and I'm applying this to my crease these colors in the palette don't have names so you're just gonna go buy me pointing that pointing at them because they don't have specific names i'm so sorry that's going to get a little confusing I'm taking this color which is under it it's a little bit more brownish not as purple and i'm just going to do the same thing I just like the mixture of those two colors a more mom anymore brown just to act as my transition shade now i'm going to take this elf brush and dip it into the top corner eyeshadow this is going to be the all over lid shade this is such a pigmented shade usually i would go in with a mac fix+ but it doesn't even need it it's metallic it's stunning I love it so much it's a nice burgundy color now i'm taking this brown shade and a skinnier priest brush and just blending everything together so that there are no harsh lines and then taking a fluffy brush and just further blending now this is matt reddish burgundy shade I love this color I'm taking that same crease brush that I used earlier is it the same one well it's like a fat pencil brush and I am just focusing this in the crease and bringing it to the inner corners as well so on the outer corner and the inner corner kind of like a halo look but not really then going back into that fluffy brush by the way this from sephora i am just blending everything out you know you know blending Oh going back into that shade we use on the lid and i just applied some more to intensify it a little then I took that golden shade and added it to the inner corners and I'm taking this la girl deep bronze eyeliner and I'm tight lining with this then I'm going to add a wing this is the Jessie's Girl liquid liner and i'm adding the wing and i always start off with little strokes and then do the tail but I like I get way too close to the camera and then you can see me and I'm a total failure i'm so sorry so let's move on to the face before I finish my eyes I'm just I was laughing so hard editing this because I look so we're doing that with my arm but I just spritz the josie maran Nirvana treatment missed on my face and then i went in with the laura mercier radiance primer so for foundation I'm using the new to face born this way i'm in warm nude I love this foundation it gives you a supernatural finish not too mad not do we either it's just a nice natural finish and it has pretty good coverage that's my mini review of any of you guys were wondering i really really like it but I mean I love everything to face makes don't I know it now i'm taking this like peachy Sammy shade concealer by pixie and i'm applying that underneath my eyes to help with my dark circles and then I'm gonna go in with concealer right on top of it so my concealer is the Maybelline better skin I can't stop using it's just so easy to blend so lightweight so i'm applying that underneath my eyes to cover up as well but also to highlight the face so that i'm going to apply it to other parts of my face to continue to highlight and then look what happens look my camera got foggy I don't understand how that happened or why and it's only like in the center because if you see the background it's not very foggy it's so weird the camera about foggy i'm using the sedona least 217 brush to blend everything out it does say foggy for a little bit longer but only for like a couple minutes and then it goes back to normal so I'm sorry so to set my under eye can see there i'm using the NYX HD setting powder in the shade banana this is a real techniques setting brush and it's good at setting let me tell you this is the charlotte tilbury micro smooth powder and i'm just going to put this on my face - not really mattify but so that there is no tackiness when I go in with my bronzer ok so bronzer of choice i'm using this laguna NARS Laguna bronzer this is like a limited edition one that came with this tiny to brush and let me just tell you I love Laguna it's one of my favorite bronzers but this video brush is not worth the money and a lot of people are like oh it's because that one short but the big one is worth the money no it sheds like crazy it sheds like crazy guys it's not worth it don't spend your money on it it's really not worth it I I least I don't think so and then I just blend everything out with my Real Techniques multitask brush so going back to the eyes the fogginess is gone I just added that same eyeliner to my waterline the one I use to tight line and then I'm taking that Matt reddish burgundy shade to smoke out the lower lash line and then a more neutral brown color on the pencil brush and just really blend everything out so far mascara I'm using my clinic lash doubling but then i'm going to go in with falsies these are the ardell demi wispies falsies and yes that is what I did for my eyes and my eyes are complete I wanted my skin to look a little bit more luminous not so flat so i took this one wild bronzer in in in the Cabana it will be listed below i forgot the name but it is not a bronzer obviously clearly it just gives it it's like a face powder that gives a nice subtle Sheen very similar to the hourglass ambient lighting powders for blush this is nicks mom I was going to say mocha what is wrong with me today okay this is the NYX blush in the shade moth and i'm using a morphe brush to apply that to mush eeks for highlight I'm using an oldie but a goodie this is max soft and gentle every time you use it I'm like huh why don't you see you every day and then I put it back and I don't use it for a while I don't know it's really really pretty you know you can't go wrong with Max soft and gentle so for lips I cannot get enough of these over a liquid lipsticks i'm sorry i love them this one is in the shade pasadena so I'm just putting that on my entire lips usually I would just go ahead and do a nude like a bear nude with this look but i wanted something more matching matching but you can do whatever you want ok guys so that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye bye hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial using the color pop where the light is for some make my kathleenlights made me breakfast if you guys haven't seen my previous video where I talked all about this why I made the colors i made why I named them the way that I name them swatches and all that stuff i will link that video down below its a video that went up before this it's very very much me it's very in my comfort zone a lot of you people are gonna be like girl you always do look like this but I mean it's four colors and not this is what i want so that I just want to represent me as much as i can in this tutorial i will be doing more stories with this quad I'm going with for some because it's not like a palette but i'm gonna be doing an everyday look with the matte shade with the other shades yeah I will do more stores if you guys want only if you want it was out of town recently i was in west palm beach on business well Danny's best like that we went for work done you have to work up there and i went with him and my face breaks out so bad so bad when I'm when I travel I don't know what it is I don't I really don't know what it is but I break out so bad one of the home the weirdest thing I don't know why I felt the need to share that story with you but I have like a nice beautiful breakout bouquet right here so i hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial and I hope you try it for yourself and you want to see how to get this look then and just give up watching oh I'm fixing my setup i'll talk about it later but i'm trying to get my old setup like back in Mississippi back in my life so I'm working on it we have you want to get this look then just keep watching so I'm going to prime my eyelids using the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer you can get this i have an H you can get this at Jessie's Girl cosmetics that come that's where i bought it and i really love this primer super shape so we're good like I mentioned before these color pop eyeshadows are best applied either with your hands or with a synthetic brush I'm going to take this brush and I got this in an Ipsy bag or a box each arm kinda remember right now and I don't know where it's from and just as modern minerals you are gorgeous and I'm going to go ahead and take the eyeshadow in the shade glow and i'm going to apply this underneath my brow bone like i said in my review or like not my review but like i said in my previous video where I'm talking about these eyeshadows this color obviously is not going to be a highlight for every skin tone as you can see but again I explains it in that video i wanted to do a really like cream shade and I wanted to do a color that they didn't already have so this is what we are working with I'm sorry if you have darker skin you definitely can mix it with the map tan shade and get the perfect highlight color but anyway i'm just applying on underneath my brow bone I think you guys and I didn't realize how far you guys were so next I'm going to take a synthetic brush another synthetic brush like this this is these away but concealer buffer 142 brush and the way the review is coming soon I know I keep saying that but it's coming soon I'm going to take this shade right here called Cornelius it's a very warm pinky brownie caramely latte color yeah and i'm going to start applying this into my crease then I'm going to go in with this shade right here which is called kathleenlights my favorite one and i'm just going to dip my finger into this one this one is definitely one that you want to use your finger with cause it just applies better but look at that pigmentation good you faint because I good so I'm just going to apply that to my entire lid like literally everywhere I'm going to go back into this smaller brush and I'm going to dip it into kathleenlights again it's so weird referring it to company lives so strange but i'm going to run that right here taking this one next this one is blaze this one is so beautiful all over the lid as well or like you can take a brush like this and pack it on the outer corners and that would be really pretty too but I just I love this all over the world and on this same brush I'm going to run that underneath my lower lash line and I'm going to bring it all the way in so I can kind of diffuse the gold a little bit this one has a lot of glitter to it like a lot of sparkle to it so it's really really fun to play with as opposed to the orange e-gold that's more of a sheen then with that same brush I'm going to take Cornelius and I am going to run that underneath my lower lash line just to help blend everything together I'm gonna take prettiest one more time and i'm just going to intensify the crease a bit so back into this so Eva concealer brush and just apply some more to my crease I love this eyeshadow all over the lid by itself like just for an everyday look love it okay next I'm going to use some eyeliner I'm going to use my favorite Brown eyeliner this is the NYX jumbo pencil liner in the shade of brown and i'm going to tight line with this and apply it to my waterline as well now i'm just taking some on the top lash line I i started doing it and completely forgot to explain it so I'm just taking some of this is a very creamy delicious eyeliner it's great to smudge out because it gives you the chance to smudge it out because it's not stiff and dry so I'm just applying it as if I were applying eyeliner really really close to my lashes and I'm going to take that same rush we've been using and the smudge it out Oh since I want this look to be really messy and like bronzy I don't want to do a really professional crisp eyeliner I want something messy and I think it looks really nice ok so for my inner corners I actually want something sparkly not mad I'm just going to take one of the colour-pop highlighters these are going to be coming out very very soon not exactly sure when the launch date is but very soon and I'm going to take lunch money it's a beautiful it's probably my favorite one to be honest out of all of them it's a beautiful like white gold or renting a lot of moonstone from becca and i'm just going to play that run in here to finish off the eyes i'm going to apply some mascara so I'm going to chrome it curl my lashes first i'm going to apply my estee lauder little black primer all over my lashes then i'm going to apply Maybelline lash sensational lash sensational right on top and then for my bottom lashes my clinic bottom lash and i will be right back ok so once you put on mascara as you can see it kind of completes the look lashes would be amazing like i said but I think like like a lot of mascara and like nice and voluminous and i don't know i think it looks really pretty like the messy Boheme I feel like its bohemian that weird like I feel a bohemian live with this makeup anyway i'm going to go ahead and finish the face so I'm gonna do things a little different usually I do like my highlight on my cheeks last but because i'm going to go in with a cream highlight I'm going to do it first you don't have to but I am going to take the Real Techniques miracle complexion sponge like camera sturdy here and the highlight I used in my inner corners this is again lunch money from colour-pop and i'm going to do my my little thing in here now going to play that to my cheeks as you can see it's intense I blend that out now don't worry I did there well I didn't have been my sponge before I applied it just to make it even more intense than I want to take the other side and blend it out so it's not like you know ok so now i'm going to go eat with bronze that and actually I'm going to use this product right here with my 129 this is a bronzer / blush product from the bomb it's called the bong desert freaking in love with this thing because it's a long wearing product and it is this is what it looks like me show you I don't know if you can tell but it's like a brown with kind of like a pinky undertone it reminds me a lot of Max harmony blush which is one of my favorite brushes from Mac because i use it as a bronzer as well i have purchased multiple harmonies like I love it that much but this is a little bit more pink in it even so i'm just going to take it on this and I'm going to start rubbing that I'm a tent is an attempt on the force for heads a fivehead Who am I kidding and I'm not so I mean I guess I mean that I'm not contouring I'm just bronzing up the skin obviously defining my cheekbones a little bit so a little bit of contour it's very very pigmented when you have to be a little bit careful use a light hand but it's super long wearing like it last all day on the skin and I think it's a really pretty color it isn't that I don't know if I mentioned that put the same brush I'm just going to add a little bit more glow factor a little bit more once a little bit going to me i'm going to stop drinking coffee before the videos this is the NYX blush in death a call that and i'm going to put that on the sheiks just to give a little bit of a glow by the way because i don't have this blush and you like warm things like why why don't you have it it's really good and so she used to do you see what's in my mouth this brush said like a mofo and it was so expensive i paid so much money I mean it's a great brush I use it all the time but they these mac brushes shed and and they scratched my face a little bit just a little bit ok so i am done with my faucet my face and I'm gonna move on to lips I'm going to take this colour-pop lippie pencil in cake and I lightly go lightly because this is pick up meant it gonna apply that and then blend it out with my finger then i'm going to apply the color pop let me stick that I cannot find I about it this is Skippy it's a glossy finish not a fan of this on its own but i do like on top of lip liner like it just put I want my lips to be even glass here which is a big surprise since i'm a mac kind of gal I'm going to take this dose of colors lip gloss in the shade well you know has mean I'm pretty sure this is called undressed i'm pretty sure it's not on the damn bottle but pressure ok so that completes this makeup tutorial using the where that line where the light is I hope you enjoyed this and I hope you guys purchased this and support me it really would appreciate it I appreciate everyone who has bought it so far I mean if you can't buy I completely understand if you don't want to buy a completely understand girl and no shame in your

it's really scary to put like a orange go lower lid I hope you like it i personally love you like I could wear this everyday okay you're like a good I could have to look like thank you guys so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look it's actually really similar to things I've done in the past but i wanted to do a like orangie Randy smoky using this eyeshadow right here that i have been using and loving these are the Knicks prismatic eyeshadows and I've always thought that they were good but I didn't realize how good they were until recently oh so you want to laugh it didn't highlight the inner corner of his eye ok let's ignore that I ended the video without even doing that Wow if you haven't tried to these prismatic eyeshadows my next they are probably one of the best drugstore if not the best drugs yes they're at the best single eyeshadows at the drug store right now and I can't believe you haven't been using I got the man I mats and i can't believe i haven't been using them every single e so this is the look i came up with it I know it's similar to things I've done what I wanted to do a full face drug sort through and I wanted to do something that's perfect for a night out especially now that we're in the summer with a really like eyeliner so if you want to get this look then just keep watching I just quickly wanted to show you guys that I did in my eyebrows using drugstore products but they take forever so I didn't show it i use the elf Broadway's and like the loreal brow mascara so now moving on to priming my eyes i'm using the Jessie's Girl eyeshadow primer i purchased mine off of jessie's girl calm and i love it i love this primary really makes the eyeshadows stick onto my lid i'm going to use a base because i want the gold to really pop underneath the eye shadow so this is a milani eyeshadow stick not sure what the name is but i'll have it listed below now taking the Knicks prismatic eyeshadow in the shade bedroom eyes i'm applying this to my entire lid with a flat shader brush i'm not exactly sure why I'm going so slow like i'm applying this eyeshadow very slowly and i don't know why but i love the prismatic eyeshadows if you don't own any please go out and purchase them they're all good every single one there's so intense they feel very high-end luxurious then I'm taking this morphy fluffy brush I like this one because it's very very like small it's a small fluffy brush this is the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and I'm taking the orange color reminds me a lot of a mixture between makeup geeks chickity and peach smoothie it's like a nice warm transition shade so i'm using this brush to blend out the prismatic eyeshadow so there are no harsh lines and to give that extra little warmth to the crease then I'm gonna go into this brown eyeshadow right here yes that one and the palate with the same brush and I'm just going to do the exact same thing because I do want to add more Brown to it I don't want it to be just like a straight-up orange crease even though i like that I just want to add more Brown to the crease there then I'm just taking a big fluffy brush with no eye shadow and blending things out so there are no harsh lines you know going into this other prismatic eyeshadow in the shade girl talk and I'm applying this to my brow bone just to give a little bit of shine I don't want to apply too much because this is a very pigmented eyeshadow so I'm barely tapping it and then I'm going into the white in the palette and I'm applying that underneath my brow bone i layered the other one underneath that I didn't want it to be just like a flat white shape so that's why then I'm going to go into a brush really similar to a mac 217 it's like a paddle fluffy blending brush and I'm going to go back into that orange shade and i'm really going to start blowing out that orange color like I decided I wanted to be a little bit more orangie in the crease you know my style so yeah that's just what I'm doing here going back and forth with that color and then I'm going to take this eyeliner from la girl and I'm tight lining with this and then i'm applying a little bit to my top lashes just too just so I could look like there's eyeliner there but there really isn't so I'm going to finish off my eyes I mean my face before I finish my eyes you know i'm priming my face with the Loreal magic Lumi light infusing primer I believe that's what it's called and then I'm going to go on with this foundation I wanted to use it because i haven't used in a long time i'm using this alpha buffer brush this is the neutrogena healthy mix foundation I'm in the shade 40 even though mmm i noticed it looks maybe a little too light but it's ok bronzer can fix that so I'm applying this to my whole face it gives a nice radiant just like Chloe look without being too greasy or too much i really like this foundation I don't know i don't use it more because it's nice then for concealer decided to bust out this LA girl Pro conceal I haven't used it in a long time this is the shape creamy beige excuse me i'm singing to get this in creamy beige and I hate the packaging i think i don't use this as much because the packaging is just so hard to squeeze this concealer out so it drives me nuts but it's an amazing concealer so i use it so I just started blending all that out and then I remembered hey this is not the brochure like to use to blend I'm gonna grab my sedona lace - 17 the perfect brush to blend out my under eye concealer i love it when I said we wait wait wait and I decided to plop on the Maybelline magic Lumi highlighting pen this is in the shade ivory I like to apply this on top of my concealer because it just brightens my under eyes a lot more it's not opaque enough or doesn't have enough coverage to be a concealer on its own but i do like to use it as a highlighter that's what i'm doing and then I'm just blending everything out yeah I don't know what's wrong with me I'm sorry but yes moving on so I've decided to do cream products i'm i'm putting on a bunch of cream products under my powder products so I'm taking the Sonia Kashuk cream bronzer in rich bronze I like this one more than warm tan it's just a little bit darker and not as like orange looking so i'm applying this with a makeup geek stippling brush and I'm just kind of contouring with this and then it falls off and almost fell out of my hand there anyway back to this oh my god my roots are so terrible like I cannot believe I haven't had my roots yet i'm going to do that soon but holy crap there so bad anyway I'm taking the Real Techniques stippling brush and I'm applying the elf cream blush in the shade peach perfection to my cheeks and I barely put anything on honestly the step was pointless because i barely put any blood on I wanted it to be mostly bronzy then I'm going to take this l'oreal lumi cream highlight this is in the shade golden and i'm applying this to my cheekbones I don't like the powders in this line but i really like the liquid illuminators that l'oreal just recently came out with so because i hadn't set my concealer with powder i blend it out with my finger just to get rid of some of the creases and now i'm going to set my under eye concealer this is a NYX powder that I couldn't open in the shade banana and this is just like a paddle brush from zoeva and i am setting my under eyes so that they don't crease and they stay in place my concealer there's a place then i'm going to go ahead and bronze with a powder bronzer now just like to set everything this is a Jane bronzer in the shade inspire and this is a morphe brush from the elite collection and i am just bronze and on my face I'm not doing anything super crazy not contouring just you know being drowsy then I'm going to take this highlighter / bronzer by Milani it's called fantastic and gold and I applied my brush and like the white sections just so i can add a highlight to my cheeks because if i would have applied it like in a bronzy section would have been too dark so that is what I did and then I finished off my eyes by applying that same brown eyeliner to my waterline and then I really got up in there and I just like a plan I'm like blinking a lot because i don't like to tug on my eyes but I apply a thick layer of that to my lower lashline a lot thicker than I normally do and then I just kind of blend it out with a brush just so that everything could be nice and even and then with a more dense pencil brush I'm going to dip it into that orange shade and just go over everything so it doesn't look like a raccoon I so that everything is nice and blended and it just looks smoky not like a harsher brown line then the mascara i'm using is from Maybelline and this is there miss manga rock mascara and I applied it to my top and bottom lashes so to finish off this look I just took the revlon super lustrous matte lipstick and smoked peach and i decided i wanted it to be glossy not mat and a little bit more pink not so peach so I took the elf extra lip gloss in the shade brian and i just applied it on top and then that's completes this make this world i really hope you guys enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you among those video peace hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here very light fresh and doing this look is perfect for those of you who don't like to wear heavy makeup like

and loving so i'll be showing you how i use this and you could actually win this product by visiting a Smashbox be water . com all the info will be below by the way so yes check that out and if you want to see how to get this look then just keep on watching so I'm going to start with my face makeup first i'm going to be taking and the Smashbox be water in the shade light and applying this to my face I'm not going to be using a primer because this already has priming benefits in this has a very sheer breathable coverage but it does do a good job of evening out my skin tone and blurring my pores as you can see it does have a runny texture so BB water is the perfect name because it honestly feels like you are applying water to your skin it's pretty amazing I really like that it has a good amount of SPF it is SPF 30 which is great to wear during the day so we can protect your skin the best part about this is that it's oil and alcohol-free so it's perfect for sensitive skin like myself this makes my skin feel so incredibly hydrated as well i have been using a non-stop and I really really love it so I'm just blending that into my skin now i'm going to move onto concealer and here i am using the Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade 15 fair i'm just applying that underneath my eyes because it has a nice fresh dewy finish so it's perfect with this look and then I'm just going to be blending that in i'm also applying that on other parts of my face to highlight and also blending that in i'm going to set the places where i apply the concealer and i'm using this NYX HD powder in the shade banana this is going to help prevent it from creasing underneath the eyes and just to make everything set nicely next I'm going to move onto bronzing up the skin I'm not going to contour just want a nice warm complexion and i am using the physicians formula bronze booster in the shade medium yeah yeah then I'm going to go in with blush and the blush I'm using today is the makeup geek blush in the shade romance it's a nice soft pink but it does have a gold Sheen to it is really pretty good the beautiful glow to the skin and now i'm going to highlight my cheeks using the colour-pop super shock cheek highlight in the shade wisp this is just going to add an even more dewy glowy appearance to the skin so i'm applying on the tops of my cheekbones on my nose and anywhere I want to look more glowy now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm going to keep it very simple just to match the rest of my face makeup ever already primed my eyes and I'm going to go in with a fluffy brush and dip it into the morphe eyeshadow in vs 13 and I'm just going to move my brush in windshield wiper motions and apply this into my crease now i'm going to take this vanilla shade it is BS 54 also from morphe and on a pencil brush i'm just applying this underneath my brow bone to highlight and then I'm going to take this eyeshadow also from morphe it is BS 76 and i'm applying this to my entire eyelid wet so I did what the eyeshadow just to intensify it a little bit more and i am just applying this on my entire lid all the way up to my crease after that I'm going to take that same highlighting Shady's underneath my brow bone and apply it to my inner corners to highlight that area too then I'm going to go back into the original shade we use first and applying this underneath my lower lashes just to smoke it out a little bit and then to finish off the eyes i am just using my L'Oreal telescopic carbon black mascara on my top and bottom lashes so to complete this look I'm going to use this over a long lasting liquid lipstick in the shade real i'm applying a light layer to my lips and then i'm going to dab it with my finger just so that it's not too intense and opaque and i'm just going to top it off with this Ellie girls jelly lip gloss it's a nice peachy color so that completes this look that you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look right here it's very dramatic for me at least I just wanted to go in like a different direction from my recent videos I've done kind of more natural simple tutorial which I love doing because I feel like those are easier to recreate what I wanted to do something like more smoky more like nighttime appropriate i would definitely wear this on a night out on the town and I didn't want to do anything warm i wanted to do a little bit more cool tone I wanted to use more cool tones actually use the Anasazi artist probably because i've only used it once in a tutorial and I wanted to use it again and the like pop of silver is this bad boy right here this is the makeup geek foiled eyeshadow in high wire so i really like how this turned out it's like a bluish silver smokey eye and i hope you guys enjoyed it if you want to see how to get these loop and just keep on watching ok so my eyelids are already primed now i'm just going to jump into this palette i'm going to take the shape buttery and i'm going to apply this all over my lid all the way up to the brow bone with the morphe 14 brush just you know to create like a base for all the shadows to blend well because i use Mac painterly Paint Pot and that can stay a little bit tacky if I don't get it then I'm going to take some scotch tape and put that on the side of my eye to create like a sort of cat eye shape and then i'm going to go into dusty rose and I'm using the morphe e23 brush this is like my new Holy grill like fluffy crease brush its toll good i love it anyway so i'm just applying dusty rose into the crease from the tape all the way to the inside of my I you know I mean yeah i'm going to take blue velvet this is the star of the show and this color you just have to build it up this part like it's a little bit tedious but you just have to stick with it and work with it i'm using the morphe e17 it's the perfect brush for this because it's like a small crease brush but it's perfect it fits right into my crease perfectly anyway so i'm applying that on the outer part of my eye where the tape is and then I'm dragging it all the way in my crease as you can see what I'm doing of course and then i'm going to start applying some eye shadow in the very inner corners of my eyes so basically I'm putting the blue everywhere except the center of the lid because we're going to be applying that silver color there so we wanted the Blue to like hug the silver if that makes sense i mean i always say if that makes sense because i know it makes sense right yeah so yes I'm just working back and forth with that color and then i'm going to go in to make it Peaks boiled eyeshadow in the shade high wire it's like a very intense silver but it has kind of like an icy blue tinge to it so I like how it pairs with the navy blue i'm applying that on the center of my eyelid with a mac 27 know with a mac 239 brush and yes then I'm going to go back into blue velvet and i'm just going to do the exact same thing just to intensify the blue and so that the high wire sheet can blend with the blue yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah then I'm gonna rub off any excess eyeshadow on that brush and then i'm going to start blending out the harsh edges I didn't want to add more blue because it would get a little bit muddy so just clean off the brush and started to smoke out the harsh lines then back into dusty rose with that same brush I'm going to start blending out the crease I really like how it looks like the navy blue and it kind of fades into like a dusty mauve I think it looks really pretty so I'm just applying this right where the navy blue eyeshadow ends so it looks like a nice and gradient effect and there are no harsh lines that way either going right back into the buttery i'm gonna use this as my brow bone highlight i'm also applying that in my inner corners even though i go back with a different eye shadows later but anyway yeah taking the Knicks gel liner in black i'm just applying this to my tight line I don't like to pull at my eye that's why i started making these crazy eye movements because i don't like talking at my eyelids then i'm going to apply some liquid liner this is the NYC liquid liner and i'm just applying a regular little wing i'm using the tape kind of like a guideline to where I want the wing to end and then after that I'm going to move onto my face before it finished my eyes to prime my face and using the NYX angel veil primer this is a little bit of a mattifying primer but I find that it doesn't dry out my skin then i'm going in with my morphe e6 brush and like my new favorite foundation this is the ex1 invisible wear foundation i'm an f100 and i'm just going to apply this on my entire face this is like a very natural foundation it's like a medium coverage but it just looks like seconds in it's beautiful and so nicely I just I love this foundation and this brush has been heavenly I love it out of stock which totally sucks but I'm hoping that they will bring it back and stop very soon because it's a good one is a good one then I'm going to take this Maybelline master conceal it concealer in the shade fair i believe and you've seen me do is about a million times I'm just blending that out with my holy grail concealer blender brush the visa don't lace - 17 I love this to blend out my under eye concealer it's just so soft and like the perfect size ok so i just get through that really quickly but I'm taking the Knicks contour kit and I'm gonna take the yellow and like the pinky shade and I mix them together and i'm going to set my under eye can see there with this this is a deli am tools like highlighter brush and then I'm going to go ahead and finish off my eyes before I complete my face I'm going to go right back into blue velvet and I'm gonna use a makeup geek pencil brush and I'm going to apply this underneath my lower lashes i had already applied applied a black eyeliner but i forgot to film that but I just apply black eyeliner to my waterline and now i'm just smoking out that blue shadow and I'm dragging it all the way across I'm going to take the black eyeshadow in the palette called cold and with that same pencil brush I'm going to smudge that on yeah and then I put the pallet in the camera and yeah there you go kathleen i'm just nudging this on the outer view of my I just a deep in that part of a bit and then to further blend everything so it's not like a harsh dark line underneath I'm taking dusty rose and I'm just blending all those colors together to smoke it out i'm applying some mascara and then I applied my ardell demi wispies on my lashes and then that completes the I look so to finish off my face I'm gonna go right back into the next contour kit i'm using this elf blending brush it is amazing to contour with it's amazing so I'm just contouring my face with that cooler tone shade in the next contour kit and I just love this brush if you guys haven't checked it out check it out from ELF it's really really inexpensive and it's just so soft and amazing i love it is just contouring my face like a normally do then I'm going to go in with this color right here it's just a little bit warmer than the other one not too warm not orange or anything and i'm just going to go over that contour again then I picked up my hair because it was driving me crazy anyway I'm taking this yellow banana shade and i'm applying it right under my contour with that deli and tools brush just to intensify the contours just gonna sharpen it a little bit and since this look at the little bit dramatic I want my contour to stand out a lot more than it normally would now i'm going to do something that i've been loving recently this is the girl lactic face glow in the shade natural and I'm doing this on a giant so a brush and I'm applying this everywhere this is a highlight for the face but it's like the most natural highlight that it just gives my face in below i put this pervert where I'm all of its glowy and it makes your skin look nice and radiant without looking grease your shiny it's fabulous I'm gonna go in with this to face blush in the shade baby love it's their new long-lasting 16-hour blushes and I'm taking this brush that looks like it's for me cool tools but it's not I got it at TJ maxx i don't even know the brand but it's a big fluffy brush very similar to equal tools and i'm applying this on my cheeks i really like this color because the natural color that goes with any makeup looks I'm going right back into the Galactic face below and natural and applying this as my highlight I would have normally gone with a more intense highlight but it was the highlight that was ready for me is how I use it on my cheekbones well I just packed on a little bit more than I did on my face of course then I took a pencil brush from sigma and i applied this to my inner corners just to intensify the inner corner a bit event of it and then for lips i'm using this essence lipstick in the shade also matt and then I thought it was just a little bit too Matt I wanted something a little glass here so i took the revlon lipstick and pink cognito to give it a little bit more shine and then that completes this makeup look I really hope you guys enjoyed it please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look it's using the new Manny and makeup geek palette I know it's currently sold out but i will link it below once it comes back in stock and it was really really requested to do a look using that palette so i thought i would give it to you guys now this look definitely calls for fake lashes but i could not find my eyelash flew anywhere but it would definitely look better with some policies also i do want to say that my eyelids look a little bit patchy because i didn't use a very good base underneath I should have gone in with like a dark basement like a deep purple base but i just used regular like clear eye shadow primer so i'm going to go ahead and get started but keep that in mind so I'm setting down the primer i use and i'm using the wet and wild eyeshadow in from brulee now i'm going into the palette i'm going to take the shade of peaches and cream on a fluffy brush and I'm just going to both that into my crease and then i just added some tape to create a sharper edge i'm going in with the shade Sora which is kind of like beaches and cream but like a deeper version really really beautiful and I'm also building that into Z Greece I'm going to take the shade of Mars it's a beautiful red shade like really stunning I'm taking it on it skinnier crease brush something a little bit more precise and I am just applying this to the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging it into my crease now i'm going to take the all over lid shade and this is Aphrodite i highly recommend you go in with like a base before this step like a deep plumber like an eyeliner and put it all over your lid because i didn't use a very good primer so it came off a little bit patchy because it didn't have like a nice base and I'm just going back into shade Mars and I'm just blending that into the crease again I want the crease to be very very red so I'm just adding a little bit more of that color and now i'm going back into sora with a fluffy brush and just blending that out because I don't want any harsh lines in my crease ok so going back to Aphrodite I'm just intensifying the lid just in case some of it got blended with all that blending and then I just took the exact same shade Aphrodite and just put that directly into my crease so that it blends really nicely into the red shade to highlight underneath my brow bone i used Luna which I probably shouldn't have because my eyebrows look a mess I'm trying to grow them out i told you guys this already but I'm trying to grow them out to reshape them so highlighting with a shimmery highlight probably wasn't a good idea about what ever use anyway so i'm applying some primer to my face I use the next angel primer and now i'm going in with the ex1 and visit wear foundation it was a little bit dark for me casino mama very fair these days but this is in the shade f100 and I'm just buffing that into my face using a wet and wild flat top kabuki brush and then i'm going to go in with concealer this is the NARS radiant creamy concealer in the shade vanilla and for a second I thought I smelled something burning but then I just kept on filming because i am a very responsible adult filming comes first who cares of the house is on fire ok so i am applying this by the way that was a joke I assumed it was the candle burning behind me so yes anyway I'm just blending that nars radiant creamy concealer into my skin using the 447 brush i applied that underneath my eye between my eyebrows and just other places of my face I wanted to highlight and yeah just working on it doing the thing I usually do i'm going to set all the places i added concealer and i'm using my RC may know color powder and you know that in my face this foundation doesn't have like a weird tacky finish so i find that I don't need to set the rest of my face just the places i added some concealer so now i'm going to finish up my eyes I'm using the bombs swing and i wanted to show you guys look at my hand is shaking I had such a hard time applying eyeliner this day I don't know why my hand was like shaking so bad look it's just I couldn't do it so yeah I struggled a little bit with my eyeliner but I tried to make it work i'm applying my kiko extra scoop of volume mascara and then I'm gonna work on my lower lash line I took the shade frappe on a pencil brush and buff that I'm gonna need my lashes and then I highlighted my inner corners with blue now this is such a beautiful inner corner highlight fabulous i'm taking my Urban Decay eyeliner in the shade mainline it's a really cool teal cool peel blue colors amazing so i'm just applying it to my waterline and then kind of blending that a little bit with a pencil brush and now i'm going in with insomnia it's a beautiful blue brown reddish she has a bunch of different ships it's such a pretty color and i just bought that on my lower lash line and then i just applied some mascara now i'm going to contour my face i'm using the wet and wild contour brush and then mixing two shades am using warm porcelain and cool porcelain these are the makeup geek contour powders I really really like them and I love mixing these two specific shape to get like a perfect contour for blush I'm using the Milani baked blush and barium or I love this blush I feel like it goes with so many looks and since the eyes are a little intense I didn't want to go you know to one chance but i am going into dance with my highlight this is the wet and wild highlight in the shade Hollywood Boulevard such a stunning like golden shade so beautiful so i'm just reading the top of my sheet room and I mine own stuff and then i'm going in with my lip this is a new over a liquid lipstick in the shade - bye it's a really really nude color so I'm going over it with makeup forever lip gloss in the shade 04 and then that completes this makeup look I really hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial

you know when the tutorial actually starts also excuse my voice I think I'm losing my voice is a little raspy I spent all night screaming sounds really bad know what i meant I was recently at halloween horror nights and ice cream for everything if you try to scare me i'm going to scream at the top of my lungs like me that's my reaction is to scream so I spent all night screaming so my voice is a little rusty but anyway so ever since the palate launched you guys have been asking me to post tutorials using the pilot I've seen so many of you guys on Instagram and on twitter tweet me that you got the palette which is so amazing and so exciting so this tutorial is using this palette and it's for those of you who have this palette you are getting this palette in the mail I know it's

palette by highlighting palette is limited edition it just hasn't sold out once it's gone it's gone the same thing goes with this palette I was so shocked to see that it sold out within two days i did not expect that trust me we got a lot of pallets we got a lot of pallets a lot of people were mad at me like how can you order so little but we didn't we ordered so many I just didn't expect this which thank you so much for supporting me and for buying the pally you guys blew me away I cannot believe I cannot believe it so that like that thank you thank you thank you so much i love each and

will let you know on twitter and on instagram so follow me on those platforms I have been talking to the owners of war and I'm gonna try to get it back one more time for you guys so that we can at least do a second round because I didn't anticipate it selling out so quickly so I feel like it would only be fair to bring it back at least one more time so that those of you who didn't get a chance to buy it will get a chance to buy it that is my main priority right now is trying to get it back I'm doing everything I can because I just hate disappointing you guys you know so hang tight I'm gonna do my best i will update you but if you do have this palette or it's coming to you in the mail this is the look i created today I used the greens in the palette kind of mix them both to get this like really pretty emerald look this is my favorite way to use the greens in this palette they're really really pretty on their own but makes together they are magical i love the combination of the two so that is what i did today and yeah if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching okay so I'm gonna start with priming my eyelids i'm using the Urban Decay primer potion that i always use and then i'm going to jump into the palette and I'm going to use this bone color to kind of set down the primer make sure it's not sticky and everything blends smoothly on top so on a fluffy crease brush I'm taking this peachy orange shade and i'm going to use this as my transition shade and putting this pretty much everywhere on my crease and then i'm going to go into this little mustard fellow right here and I'm going to take another blending brush and really focus this into my crease and just blending those two shades together now i'm going to take a flat shader brush and zip into this color right here it's a very mossy green has a lot of brown to it and i'm going to apply this to my entire lid and then I took a fluffy crease brush with no additional product and blend it out those harsh lines then i apply this green eyeshadow right on top so i use the same brush only I flipped it over and applying this eyeshadow on top creates kind of like a really dark emerald look I really love these two shadows paired together and then I dip the brush back into that little mustard shade and i'm using this to blend everything out making sure all the colors look nice and blend it into one another going back into the palette i'm going to take this cool tone grey Brown and I'm going to use kind of like a smaller crease brush and I'm focusing this color on the outer parts of my eyes and I'm also dragging this into the crease just so that they all mesh well together I feel like it was missing something so i added a little bit of that cool tone brown and then I went back into that mustard shade and I'm just you know blend away just lots and lots of blending going back into this bone color I'm going to use this to highlight underneath my brow bone so I took a little bit of that eyeshadow and then I dip my brush into this really intense highlighting shade but I didn't apply a lot so just a little bit of that underneath my brow bone just to give it a little bit something extra and for my eyeliner I'm using the English gel liner number 77 i am like the world's worst eyeliner draw or whatever you know it's really hard to do this on camera so just apply a wing or don't apply wing do whatever you want but i just applied kinda like a smallish medium-sized wing and then I decided to move on to the face before finishing up the eyes i primed my face using the NYX angel primer and then the foundation I'm using is the Milani concealing perfect found foundation this in the shape creamy vanilla this is like extremely yellow i have a neutral yellow undertone but this is like yellow but it doesn't look so bad in the end after applying concealer and all of that so the concealer i'm using is the collection lasting perfection ultimate concealer this in the shade fair and i'm doing one side at a time because it is a very mac concealer and it dries very very quickly so i added a little bit more and this is very brightening but it covers really well i love this concealer and then I applied some of the Wet n Wild highlighting and concealing pen right on top just to balance out the color because the foundation was just a little bit too yellow for me so I'm just blending that in with my Beauty Blender up and then to set down that concealer i am using my favorite RCA no color powder ok so to finish up the eyes i'm gonna dump dump whoa what I meant to say i'm going to jump into the mustard shade again and i'm using kind of a thicker pencil brush and I'm applying this to my lower lashline and then I took the colour-pop cream gel liner in the shade teaspoon and i'm applying this to my waterline and I know I'm like pulling on my eyes here I never do that I'm so sorry but I was just trying to apply it as pigmented as I could so I'm to create a little bit of darkness underneath my lower lashline i took that dark green shade on a tiny little pencil brush and really smoked out that color and then I applied some more of that mustard shade just to tie everything together and to smoke it out a bit for mascara i am taking the essence lash princess on my top and bottom lashes and then i'm going to apply some inner corner highlight with this super intensifying highlighting shade in the palette it's my favorite for my inner corners I think it's stunning so I applied that to my inner corners and then I popped on some falsies these are the iler looks like pho mink lashes and they're really beautiful to add some black to my tight line just so that everything looks nice and black i used the essence smoky liner in smoky black so let's contour the face shall we this is the chemical on sculpting powder in the shade light and i'm using this to contour my cheekbones this just become my ultimate favorite contour powder of all time this new like light shade it's my favorite chisels out the cheeks like nothing i love it it's perfect and then to just warm up the skin a bit i took the bhcosmetics satin bronzer in the shade totally tan and this just warmed up my skin a little bit because the cabin upon potter obviously is a little bit more cool ton't i also took some of that on my neck so that everything matched nicely think i'm losing my voice and ok so for blush i am taking these you a powder blush in the shade rose very beautiful pinky mavi color very beautiful i love it and then I'm going to take the jcat Triple Crown baked eyeshadow in the shade what is this called due diligence that's right industry due to the legend and i'm using this to highlight my face my nose my Cupid's ball all the good stuff for lips i took the remote exaggerated full color lip liner in the shade natural and I just lined my lips and I also filled it in with this lip liner and then to go right on top of that lip liner I took the NARS above it matte lip pencil in the shade Bettina it's a similar color only the NARS the pencil is more purple so you have that complete this look I hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching please the trip if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye you wanna hear something funny i sat down to film this video and i did one eye and there was someone there was a lot of fun and then I started filming and there was no son there's a tornado happening in Florida or something because the Thunder and the lightning and the rain is so intense that I couldn't film the lighting is absolutely horn and I know it's going to be a lot of people commenting saying where are your lights you were talking about like and yes i know i have been talking about like I've been saying that I'm gonna get lights but something happened long story has to do with my room and it's a long story of why I cannot put lights in this room especially the lights that I want they don't fit i did not explain it my room is tiny here and they just don't fit so i'm not going to have lights till I'm back home which would be next month so in a month in a month i'll be on my lighting game I'm just so stressed out because so many things are going wrong with videos lately i updated i'm moving and i have no idea how to use the new imovie I already sucking editing to begin with it is just a hot mess so I got final cut pro and I'm trying to learn how to use that my friend is teaching me how to use it and it's just that is the reason why there has been a lack of videos this week like all of this week and it is because the rain doesn't stop and I'm trying to learn a new editing software so please bear with me please the so honestly it has never been this dark in this room ever when I'm filming usually when it's this dark I'm like forget it I'm not filming today but I have missed so many videos this week that I thought maybe a dark one or a shadowy one was better than none maybe not maybe you guys are like no this is way too dark I'm not even watching this I don't know I'm stressed out anyway sorry for long intro i wanted to just update you on a couple of things but today's tutorial is using the it cosmetics not leave pretty palette I wanted to do something that was like really smoky and suitable for like a night out on the town and you can obviously make this a little bit more dramatic and add false lashes I didn't I never do but i really really love this look because it is using the more darker shade in the palette i use the purple and the navy blue so it's kind of like a wearable way to wear navy blue and purple I feel because those colors seem to be a little bit less wearable and since this palette is full everyday natural colors i decided to pump it up a little bit and make it more next time appropriate I thought it looked pretty good if you want to see how to get this night out smokey eye using this palette then just keep watching so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to be taking my Mac painterly Paint Pot and i'm going to be using this to prime my eyelids and cover up all those veins I'm taking this light color right here called soft light and I'm just gonna be applying this into my crease and just basically using this as my transition shade just buffing it all over my face then I'm going to take the purple in the palette called violet and on a flat shader brush i'm just going to apply this all over my lid all the way up to the crease and then going to be taking a mac 217 and just blending out those harsh edges and bringing that color up into my crease a little bit next I'm going to take this urban decay eyeliner in the color binge and i'm going to apply this to my waterline and my tight line as well next I'm going to this navy blue shade called midnight and on my mac 217 i'm going to start building this color up slowly packing it onto the outer view of my eye and then dragging it into the crease i'm going to be doing this over and over again until i get the desired shade that I want is just a lot of building up and blending so just take your time with this then I'm just going to take an angled brush and dip it right into that midnight color and kind of use this as an eyeliner really close to my lash line just to give it a little bit more dimension and make it look a little bit more smoky and deep since i'm not going to be using liquid liner that is what i'm doing i'm going to take the black in this palette and I'm just gonna pack this on the outer view of my I really focusing it on the outer V just keep it up a little bit and make it more smoky i'm just going to pack that on and then start dragging it towards the center of my eye just to blend out the little harsh line next I'm going to dip my fluffy brush into the color violet and i'm just going to start blending out all the harsh lines and really just blowing everything out and kind of defusing the colors i really want the purple to stand out in the

I will be back and better than ever very soon thank you so much for watching guys please subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you next time yes so today's video is going to be a drugstore back to school makeup tutorial this is the kind of makeup I would wear to high school and it's using none other than drugstore products and i'm also using affordable brushes as well it's a talk through video yeah so you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching ok so I've already done my eyebrows and i used the NYX micro brow pencil and brunette and I said it with the loreal brow stylist plumper in light to medium but I really natural with my eyebrows today if you guys watch my videos you know you you know I like a bold brow but I went I just followed the exact natural shape of my eyebrow to fill in any of the sparse areas i have a little bit of bald spots in between so i used these two products these are the best drugstore products for the eyebrows I do think that no matter what I have to fill my eyebrows and even if i'm not putting on makeup on the rest of my face I have to do my eyebrows so that is what I did to get started on my makeup i am going to get my hair on my face i bought this specifically for my tutorials our little hearts but to me it looks like a little bear like little bear ears oh I just hate having my hair my face when I do tutorials so ok so I'm going to start off with my face when I went to high school I've said this about a million times but I didn't start wearing makeup until I graduated high school till I was 18 like actual makeup in high school I literally had the same routine every day I put on a brown eyeliner or black depending on how i felt that it huh brown or black eyeliner on my waterline mascara and lipstick those three things and that's simply because i didn't like to wear makeup that much in high school I didn't really get obsessed with it till I after I graduated and I could not be bothered in the morning my mom had to like force me out of it even as a senior in high school she was like like get up I was one-hundred-percent not a morning person so i did my makeup while my mom drove me to school every morning and it was only three things so I got it done really fast but if I had to go back to high school right now this is probably the kind of makeup I where I still wouldn't wear foundation I would probably only put concealer on the certain areas that i need concealing but today i'm going to be using my Maybelline Dream pure BB cream I love this BB cream is my favorite one from the drugstore it has salicylic act acted it has salicylic acid acne treatment in it which I find doesn't really help my skin but it doesn't break me out so I'm all for that i'm using my Real Techniques sculpting brush and I am just putting that on your face this is in the shade light to medium sized very very sheer coverage but on me it doesn't get greasy throughout the day it doesn't get disgusting if I'm going to be completely honest with you i would recommend something with SPF I don't think this has SPF especially if you have PE or anything like that it's smarter to use a product with SPF in it so if you are going to use this product just put on a moisturizer that has SPF on first and then going with this that is what I would do i'm loving one by tasha at the moment and that is not drug store so I'm not including it so everyone wakes up really really early to go to school and well we've got some dark circles folks and we need to cover those bad boys up i'm going to use the Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser this has really good coverage but it's really light so i like it underneath the eyes I have mine in the shade fair and i'm not going to highlight or anything I'm just gonna dab this underneath my eyes on my dark circles and i'm just going to blend that out i'm also going to bring that on to my eyelid to help cover up the veins I have very veiny eyelids so this is going to help cover them up conceal it you could even use your fingers if you don't have makeup brushes just that this into your under eyes with your fingers oh great there's a man with a leaf blower ok so let's ignore the leaf blower really quick I have to set my under eye concealer no matter what I don't set the rest of my face with powder because i have dry skin if you have oily skin even normal skin i do recommend setting your face political last all those are words you are in school system and I can see I'm using the elf high definition under I setting powder I lost this and i finally found it it's one of the best under I setting powders and his life three dollars very brightening i really like it using the Real Techniques setting brush now my face seems a little bit washed out a little bit just like flat there's not much to it so i'm going to bronze the skin and I'm going to use my ELF pressed mineral bronzer in 10 toffee this is a great affordable bronzer I'm taking this real techniques that that blush brush and I'm just going to warm up the face I know that contours all the rage right now and all that stuff but guys please don't feel like you have to contour to go to school please don't feel like that please don't feel like you need to look like cut production and in fourth period because you don't I feel like people have this expectation that you have to look super makeup you all the time and that is not true i mean my eye bags were on fleek in high school and I never completed them yellow I didn't have time for that but on the flip side do not let anybody make you feel like you cannot wear a smoky eye to school if you want to wear a little smoky eye to school if you want to highlight your face put on five layers of foundation if you want to wear that to school do not let anybody anybody make you feel like you shouldn't it's just makeup and washes off at the end of the day and if you want to go ham go ham if you want to not wear makeup don't wear makeup who cares society these days um this makeup tutorial specifically is what I would wear to high school personally so that is why I'm doing it this way because it's what i would do and it's my tutorial you know ok now that I don't feel like a zombie anymore all hail bronzer I love me some bronzer i am going to add a little bit of that same bronzer in the crease of my eye I would never have done eyeshadow for high school because I did not have time for that I love getting my extra 10 minutes of sleep so just dusting bronzer in the crease will make a world of a difference it looks like you put a little something something when really it's just a little bit of runs are you know I feel like doing eyeshadow takes a lot of time and you have to concentrate and all that stuff so I just messily so that bronzer in my crease and call it a day now i'm just using this cultural sense brush to get that same bronzer and just a little bit underneath my lashes my lower lashes now i am completely done with my eyes just a little bit of definition and now i'm going to use the Maybelline lash sensational mascara i love this one because it gives me a lot of volume and I love having thick lashes no matter what I do so I'm just going to add just too thin coats of this to my top and bottom lashes next I'm going to define the eyes just a little bit of eyeliner on my lower lash line i'm not going to tight line or anything i'm using the gel pencil liner by NYX in brown I just think it's a little bit less harsh than black and then that completes the i zoomed in a little bit just so you can see this is just a little bit of bronzer in the crease mascara and brown eyeliner ok so normally at this point i would just throw on some lip gloss lipstick whatever whatever lip liner but i am going to apply and need to be of bullish just a little bit of blush because i know some people like cannot go without blush I'm somebody who I rather just do bronzer and that's it some people rather do blush and skip bronzer but i'm just going to add a little bit of this Milani baked blush in luminaux so because it does have a sheen to it and I cannot be bothered to highlight to go to school cos hour so i'm just adding a little bit of Luminoso could create a soft glow to my skin you see and this way it looks like you highlighted because of the Machine and the blush let's have didn't ok and to finish off the look i really recommend something like this this is the alpha moisturizing lipstick in the shade in the nude it's more of a darker a little bit more of a brown dude but it is a sheer lipstick and they're very very moisturizing it almost feels like a lip balm so i recommend something like this because it's really easy to throw in your book bag or to settle in your purse and just reapply throughout the day without even using a mirror because it's foolproof since it is so shear and hydrating it's not something that you need a lip liner with it's not something you need a mirror with so i am just putting this on and what I love most about this lipstick is that eventually it just dries down to a mat kind of finish but it isn't uncomfortable it's not mad it feels hydrating but it's not glossy and I like that if this lip color is too dark for you go with something a little bit pinky or a little bit of each year or more natural clear gloss whatever you feel comfortable with that complete this back to school makeup look I really hope you guys enjoyed it leave me a comment down below if you actually are excited to go back to school or if you already started school I might be late on this tutorial but anyway I love you guys thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a tutorial on this look around her it's using the jack on her favorites palette a tutorial using this palette has been requested since i reviewed it and during the move I lost it I lost this and like five other pilots had a little meltdown thought they were gone for good and i finally found this in a box of stuff that I had not opened yet which is weird because i remember correctly makeup in that box but anyway obviously this isn't a very like natural like makeup look I thought it would be fun to play around with some glitter like on the lash line and just to use like Pink's on the lid i used mainly like these colors right here and this really pretty coral so yes this is the local game of wii i'm french now hope you enjoy this video and I don't know why I'm wearing this shirt this shirt totally doesn't go with this look but honestly didn't know what I was doing I was it was just the shirt I was wearing hashtag lazy if you want to see how to get this look then just keep on watching ok so i've already primed my lids and I'm taking this color right here in the palette and I'm applying this color into my crease as my transition shade now all of these colors have like individual numbering but it doesn't show up on the actual palette so i will leave a link down below of the shades i use that like the numbers that correspond to each shadow i will leave it all in the description box so now i'm taking this really pretty pinky cranberry shade and on a flat shader brush i'm applying this to my entire lid I'm grabbing my fixed plus and I'm spring my brush giving it back into that eyeshadow and plopping you're right back onto my eyelid to just intensify that color even more now I'm going to take this really beautiful coral shade and i'm going to apply this into my crease with a little fluffy brush i actually got this brush in my Ipsy bag that video will go up after this video sorry it's taken me so long to post but yeah it's a really nice little blending branch and i'm just applying that everywhere in my crease I'm taking these two shades one is a more pinky champagne and the other one is more gold and i'm using that to highlight my brow bone and then this shade right here take a really pretty pink iridescent I don't know it's beautiful and on my flat shader brush I'm just popping that right into the center of the lid just so that like it looks like the light catches the center of the eyeball if that makes it so okay really quickly I'm going to my face ok this is the hourglass primer serum and this has changed the game for me I want you guys to see how this makes my skin look I do not recommend this for anybody except super super super dry skin because it's pretty much like an oil for your face but matte foundation lies beautifully on top of it for me I couldn't use like matte foundation so much before but it's amazing as you can tell by my face i really love it so on top of that i'm using it the maybelline fit me foundation in 120 I'm just darling that on my entire face of course danny has to you know interrupt he works all day in the Sun so he's like a different color so I'm blending that into my skin with my makeup oh excuse me with my makeup geek stippling brush that conversation stippling brush i love this is the best brush for foundation and I'm just loving that right into the skin im using the urban decay and naked in concealer this is in light no this isn't fair neutral i keep forgetting the name but it's in fair neutral and i'm applying that underneath my eyes and just highlighting the rest of my face honestly I can't like I can't use any other concealer recently because this concealer is the best out there i'm also going to use that concealer to like sharpen the eyeshadow event and yeah I just wanted you guys have seen me to that a million times so i just get that but I'm taking this yellow powder in the Knicks contour kit and i'm using not to set my under eye concealer it's kind of like their banana shade that's what it's called so yes this is an elk brush I used to set it i'm taking this mr. right now eyeliner by the ball i'll leave the shade name below but it's a really pretty gray and i just put that on my waterline and my tight line as well then I'm taking this beautiful matte purple and i am putting this on my lower lash line with a pencil brush it's such a pretty purple i love it then I'm just going to drag that purple look it's getting hard to explain but you can see what I'm doing I'm just dragging the line upwards so it can match like the top of my eyelid you know I'm saying yeah back into this crocheted with that same pencil brush I'm just blending that purple out a little bit so that all the colors can like flow together and match to highlight my inner corners i'm just using the same two shades i used to highlight my brow bone now I'm taking this lit cosmetics glitter it's amazing and the lit cosmetics adhesive and here i'm showing you the glitter i'll be hoping it doesn't fall everywhere but it's such a pretty red with like a bunch of pink little I don't know it's really beautiful this is a tart brush exactly sure that name but it's like their eyeliner brush and I'm just applying this really really close to my upper lash line just like it was liquid liner you know like a typical black liquid liner i'm doing that just with glitter instead and I really kotor now it's just a little touch you can only tell when your eyes are closed but it's really pretty i like it so I'm packing on the mascara to my top and lower lashes as well this is the clinic bottom lash and then i'm applying some demi wispies to my eyelashes and that completes the eyes so moving on to the rest of the face i'm taking the cooler toned contouring powder in the Knicks contour kit and i'm using this to just hollow out my cheekbones and to contour you know because its contract yeah and then to just warm up my skin just a little i'm taking the physicians formula bronze booster bronzer with my Sigma duo fiber brush almost forgot the name and i'm just adding a little bit of warmth to the face for blush I'm using the NYX blush in the shade mom it looks so pretty like with any look and since the eyes are so like BAM and colorful I wanted to go pretty light on the blush and for the highlight I'm using one by NARS it's so it's a blush but it is not a bullish it's called reckless and at first I didn't like this because it has a little bit of glitter in it but it is really really pretty what supplied to the cheeks I don't know for some reason it's not showing up on camera but it's pretty intense and I like it and I'm using a real techniques i shadow brush so to finish up the look i'm using the fergie daily lipstick by wooden wild and then that completes take a look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look it is using the two-faced sweet peach palette it's been so highly requested to do my favorite look with this palette and this is pretty much it it's very similar to the look I did in my no mirror makeup challenge is obviously much better because i had a mirror and I really really love it very warm and summary and fresh so if you want to see how to get this look then let's just you know get started so I've already primed my eyes and I have applied some eyeshadow to set down that primer I'm gonna go straight into the sweet fish palette and the first color but I take is Georgia it's a really pretty peachy pink color and I'm taking this on a fluffy blending brush applying this into my crease i'm using this color as my transition shade so all the colors can kind of blend seamlessly I'm sorry this is like out of focus here but I'm taking it the brown shade in the palette this is called puree it's a very very warm peachy orange e brown I love it so I'm just packing this on the outer corners and drag me into my crease I'm going to take the shadow luscious while i like to call it touches I'm taking the lunches color and i'm applying this on my entire lid using a flat shader brush I want this color everywhere like I want it all to be shimmery and then I'm going to take summer yum and I'm going to buff that on the outer corners and drag that into my crease as well the same thing I did with puree only adding a little bit more depth and warmth that i took a brush that was a little more dense this one is from coastal sense it's just like a flat shader brush and I'm packing that summer young color on the outer corners and then slowly dragged me into the crease I want any more precise brush to apply more product and then I just took Georgia to blend all that out to highlight underneath my brow bone i just took the white shade in the palette my eyebrows are on fire i need to get them done and then I just took luscious again and applied some more just in case some of it got blend no way and now i'm mixing luscious with the white shade and i'm applying that in my inner corners ok so starting on my face I'm taking the Knicks born to glow illuminating primer and then i'm going in with my she sado synchro skin foundation i'm applying the foundation with my pure sponge i have been loving this foundation it gives you really good coverage and it just looks really nice on the skin like it lasts a long time I'm totally into it lovin it so i'm just applying on my entire face i'm speeding through this part because you've seen it a million times now i'm taking my lasting perfection concealer by the brand collection I got this concealer on amazon I've done a lot of questions where I got it I got on Amazon because i'm pretty sure we cannot get this in the States so I found it on amazon I'm just blending that in with my sponge once again now i'm going to set down that concealer i'm using my NYC smooth skin translucent loose powder and I'm just gonna set my under eye concealer with this this is actually a really great powder it doesn't look powdery on my dry skin and it was insanely affordable pretty good i'm going to say breathe to break the mood so I'm going to finish off my eyes I'm going to take my NYX brown eyeliner my towards your Lee eyeliner in brown and i'm going to tight line and add that to my waterline as well then I'm going to take some are young and on a pencil brush I'm just gonna buff that on my lower lash line and then this is the part where i got really frustrating for some reason i could not do a wing today like oh my gosh i'm using the ardency Inn punker eyeliner in black and okay yeah I'm totally out of the frame here this is usually what ends up happening when i try to do some liquid liner I don't notice i'm out of the frame I was so frustrated because it didn't turn out so good but I took my jordana best / extreme applied that to my lashes and then i went in with some ardell falsies these are these soft touch for c's and then that completes the eyes a little bit struggle struggle had a little bit of trouble with that wing but we survived so now i'm going in with this NARS duo it's the hot sand and laguna duo so I'm just taking the Laguna bronzer on this mac brushes like a flat paddle brush and I'm kind of contouring and bronzing the skin at the same time this bronzer can do both i feel like it can contour but bronze you up very well I really really really love this bronzer I'm just bronzing up the skin now i'm going in with blush this is the to face sweetheart blush in the shade is sparkling Bellini I'm kind of focusing my brush on the top two shades not so much like the dark pink and I'm just popping that on the cheeks it gives you a really pretty orangi pinky glow and for highlight i'm just going to take the hots and highlight that's in this duo i'm applying this with my morphe m310 brush a nice little fan brush and then i apply some setting spray this is the wet and wild setting spray and I have popped up on my entire face and then went in with my highlight again just to intensify it doing this little trick really does intensify your highlight it's amazing and then i went in with a different brush to highlight my nose I don't know why I don't know what I did so yes and to finish off the look of warning of my lip color this is a fancy by color pop but I didn't want something so intense i wanted like a milky version of a coral so I just blend that out with my finger and then i went with this tarp lip gloss in the shade hella and just put that on top and blended that in and I really liked how it looked that's like a glossy pinky coral but it's a little bit more natural and that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here it's very simple it's mainly focused on my skin there's something about spring and summer that I just love looking extra doing extra glowy as if the Sun and the weather naturally made my skin look that way but it was makeup is very minimal and fresh but it is still a full face of makeup just on the natural looking side i love it i feel like i can wear my makeup like this every single day and I would be okay with it just changing up my lip color and my eyeliner and I'd be set so if you want to see how to get this really dewy skin and make up I guess just keep watching so the first thing I'm going to do is take my hair in my face as per year ish already filled in my eyebrows and i use the colour-pop brow pencil in dope dope the reason I'm mentioning this is because I've been a lot of questions from you guys asking if I like it or not and I'm still on the fence with these color pop brow pencils I like them but I don't love them like i like my honest hacia one more but this is so affordable at the same time it's like it's awesome but it's not as waxy as I would like it to be but I used it today and i've been using it i like it it's just not my favorite to prime my face i'm going to use the glossy a priming moisturizer I really really like this reminds me a lot of my Too Faced hangover primer but it's even more moisturizing if that's possible it doesn't smell as good as that one but it is very hydrating and it has that same kind of consistency as well now usually on a day to day basis I don't apply foundation but this is like a full-blown makeup tutorial like I'm doing the whole shebang but today i'm going to be using the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation I'm going to be mixing it with an oil this is from the blissful body it's an etsy shop bless my body makes one of my favorite body moisturizers but you can use any oil you have argan oil holy oil any oil you have this has like a bunch of different oils in it going to add a pump of this to the back of my hand I'm in the shade porcelain and then I'm just going to take a very little amount of this apply to little drops to the back of my hand and mix that I'm going to take the elf ultimate blending brush to buff that in before I apply some concealer i'm going to add some of this guy i just recently purchased this and i have been loving this this is the marc jacobs spotlight glow stick pretty much looks like go dormant you know and honestly the packaging kind of throws me off a little bit i I don't know if it's marketed like to just apply straight from the thing but I don't like doing that I'm going to take the sedona least 217 brush and I'm going to apply this to the tops of my cheekbones and I'm doing this first because it is a cream product and i want to lay down all the cream products before i go over with powder ok so now i'm going to apply some under-eye concealer I'm going to use my it cosmetics bye bye under eye illumination this is like a newer concealer i purchased mine either on the it cosmetics website or ultimate pretty sure I got this on the website if you are familiar with the bye bye under eye it's pretty much the exact same thing only it's a little bit more illuminating just going to apply very little like I barely squeeze this onto my finger and then blend it in because this is really really really thick yeah now I'm just blending that in with this tiny little random key go brush face 500 remember how I got this now i'm going to set the under eyes and pretty much the rest of my face with the RCA no color powder ok so now I've set my entire face and you could see that myspace is still glowy but it's not tacky anymore because I said it its own i'm going to bronze up the skin I'm just going to go ahead and finish my face before I do my eyes because i'm going to do something extremely simple on the eyes it's what I've been doing a lot recently and i'm going to use the positions before we left but a bronze you guys not available this it's one of the best bronzers I've ever tried seriously I'm going to use my zoeva looks grand powder brush number 90 I love this for bronzer because it tapers and it's God's perfect i love this brush yeah some on the neck and the jawline so it's a uniform you know so that's pretty much all the bronzer i want to add I'm not trying to contour anything but i do like to rub some on my nose just so that it looks like the Sun kind of kissed my whole face for blush I'm going to go in with the wet and wild color icon blush in apricot in the middle africa in the middle actually just pick this one about walgreens like two days ago I haven't tried this one yeah this is hey multitask brush from Real Techniques this is so beautiful when it's like two to three dollars gonna take my morphe and b5 brush and just blend it all together this is quite possibly my favorite sibling brush of all time it's really good ok so i'm going to go ahead and start on my eyes because i want to show you guys a little trick that I've been doing with my highlight okay so four eyes were going very basic here very minimal I have been extremely into metallic eye liner for like the past week rose gold gold like I don't know I've just really been into it one of my favorite ones is from colour-pop it's called get paid it's like a rose gold I also love show me that one is like a bronze eagle that  i've been using a lot too but I'm just gonna tighten with this and add it to my waterline as well and then i'll just take a pencil brush and a color like really similar to the eyeliner today I'm going to use the l'oreal colour reach sunset eyeshadow and on this be 36 this is my favorite pencil brush from morphe if you ever see me using a pencil brush in my videos nine times out of 10 it's going to be the e36 i have a ten percent off more peacoat i will link it down below best pencil brush ever this is the only pencil brush that doesn't hurt my eyes I know that seems really weird but a lot of pencil brush is just scratch my eyes are going to add a little bit of this to my lower lash line and a little bit to my top lashes as well this color is very very very soft so it doesn't show up too much which I like four looks like that because i only want to define my lashline I don't really want to do like an intense look now I'm just curling my life the shoes and going in with some mascara I'm using the Kiko extra sculpt Volume Mascara coast to coast so that completes the guys you can see it's nothing special but it just gives it a little bit of a pop to the eyes oh I'm such a fool the reason why i wanted to do my eyes first and then come back to the face is because i wanted to show you my little trick but I put on mascara already usually I don't like to do this part with mascara but it's okay we can do it i'll show you in a second but first i'm going to take a little bit of the hour glass powder in luminous light this is a wet and wild stippling brush and I'm just going to applies some of this to my face to add a little bit more of a globe because we're not going enough for highlight i'm actually going to take this product right here this is the laura geller filter finish setting powder in universal it looks like it has a bunch of color correcting powders but it's pretty much like the same pearly kind of finish and this is a very soft very natural luminous powder like I don't know if you can tell it's like barely noticeable but i love it it doesn't emphasize the texture on your skin it's like a really nice soft everyday highlight but the way i like to intensify it just a little bit is I like to set my face and then apply the highlight with my face still being wet so today I'm going to use the wet and wild photo focus setting spray this is actually a great setting spray and it's like under five dollars it does make your makeup lasts all day so and i love the spray nozzle on this it's so fine and with my face still being a little bit what I'm going to take my fan brush this is the morphe and 310 i'm going to highlight my cheeks this is an awesome little trick to do for those of you who feel like your highlight isn't intense enough this is awesome for you and also i feel like it makes my highlight last longer I don't know what it is I don't know if it's because i'm applying it on top of a setting spray it just makes my highlight last all day when i do it like this awesome so now i'm just gonna let that dry ok so now that my face is pretty much dry this is what my skin looks like my face is completely dry it's not tacky because I initially set it with powder and then I just continue to use powder products on top like if you saw my skin in person you would never tell I

taking jordanna's fabric liner and i'm going to use this to create a winged I look and I was completely out of the frame doing this so we're just gonna breeze past them I'm going to take that black color again and do the exact same thing I did before just packing it on to my outer be and bringing it into my crease a little bit yeah yeah I'm going to go back into that love in Paris palette and take the darker matte grey and i'm going to use this to blend everything out and make it look nice and seamless I'm gonna go back into that blush and add some more pink into the crease I just wanted to look really nice and soft and romantic since it is a Valentine's Day tutorial after all now i'm gonna take this one a wild trio called walking on eggshells i believe and I'm going to take the brow

with the NYX butter gloss in creme brulee yeah and then that is the end of this drug store valentine's day tutorial i hope you enjoyed and I'll see you in my next video bye guys hey guys so today's video is a one brand tutorial featuring wet and wild I told you guys recently that i wanted to get back into these one brand tutorial and today we're using one wild it was only once I completed this look that I realized I actually have a look ridiculously similar to this already on my channel that i did not that long ago so I'm so sorry this looks very similar to a previous look but it is a full face what a wild look so i decided to just just post it anyway because i really love how my face makeup turned out and I just like how romantic the look is and since all of these products are ridiculously affordable I thought maybe it was worth a watch the one thing I will say is I love wet and wild as a brand I think they're probably one of the best drugstore brands not only in terms of quality but in terms of price but I so struggled with my eye makeup and I will go into details in the video but i use a combination of the wet and wild single eyeshadows the comfort zone palette which is probably the best when a while pilot ever and i also used this palette this is a new one wild pilot called i'm not a row and this is the rosy toned one it has a lot of reds and pinks and I do not like this palette at all i just used to of the shadows but I just didn't like them this copper one is the 1i used on my entire lid and I just pictured it completely different i have to wet it and even after waiting it wasn't enough it kind of was coming it is coming off right now i don't know if you can see it there but it was like coming off in patches which probably means this I makeup won't last that long but I still want you guys to see the whole the whole process anyway I wanted to do something very very simple because maybe you're watching this video because you just started out and makeup and wet and wild is the brand you're looking at first so this I makeup is extremely easy I just honestly would not recommend the these pallets i would go strictly for the comfort zone or any other wet and wild palette like this the only thing on my face that isn't what a wild is my mascara because I cannot find my mascara anywhere i purposely bought one for this tutorial i bought the mega lengths mascara it's in a purple tube no idea where it is can't find it anywhere but besides that everything on my face is wet and wild and I am in love with the face makeup like every face product i use today I love so much i think that's definitely where the money is at its face makeup when it comes to what a while and ridiculously cheap way cheaper than other brands at the drugstore so you don't forget to leave me a comment down below what you want my next one brand tutorial to me and i will look into it so if you want to see how to get this romantic glowy look just keep watching ok so I'm actually going to start off this tutorial with my brows i'm using the wet and wild color icon brow shaper this is just like a clear wax use that to brush my hairs and then i went in with this little ultimate brow kit in the shade ash brown probably not my perfect shade but i'm using the lightest powder in the kit and I'm just running this through my brows and just kind of shaping them the way I want them to it's kind of hard to do it with powder alone i usually like using a brow pencil and then a powder on top not just a powder by itself but I don't think it turned out horribly for being like a weird shade and yeah so I actually put the wet and wild ultimate brown mascara on top this is in the shade nothing but brunette I love this bra mascara it's really good and then i moved on to Z face this is the wet and wild color icon face primer this is a good primer it just kind of smoothes out your skin and it gives you a nice base for foundation and then i went in with the cover off that I say color icon primer I meant cover all primer and then i went in with the wet and wild cover off foundation this one is in the shade fair / light and i'm just applying that on my entire face using a real techniques sponge I broke out on my forehead after i did a photoshoot recently like broke out pretty badly on my forehead don't know what caused it either so strange i'm going to take the come correct can see they're very similar to the it cosmetics bye bye under eye it's very very thick so I'm blending it in a little bit with my finger and then to kind of make it a little bit liquid here i am mixing it in with this wet and wild highlighting pen in the shade ivory into you this is just going to make it easier to blend so i'm highlighting with this as well all over the face like a savage around my mouth it takes a while to blend this under eye concealer out but you know doing my best with the sponge i'm going to set that concealer using the wet and wild contour little duo kit thing this is in the shade duty letter and I took the light shade in the duo and i use this to set my under eye concealer and anywhere else I placed the concealer ok so now let's move on to the eyes i'm going to use this new one wild primer this is the photo focus eye primer and this is not for those of you who have really dry eyelids because it can dry out the lids just a little bit i recommend padding it in but it does make your eyeshadow last all day I took the wet and wild single eyeshadow and creme brulee and just set that primer down and I went into this out in stl palette this is the pinky tone one and i took that shade i pointed at and i'm using this kind of as a transition shade and then I wanted something a little bit more Brown in the crease so it took the comfort zone palette and i took the shade labeled crease on the left side i'm using the same brush just kind of like a nice blending crease brush and I'm buffing this into my crease as well I'm gonna take this wet and wild photo focus setting spray and i'm going to wet this one dollar elf brush and I'm going to dip it into that copper shade in that palette and I do not like this eyeshadow I definitely had to wet it because when i tried to use it dry on the other i 0 pigmentation was coming off on the brush like zero it's not the best eye shadow it kind of splotches off but anyway I took a fluffy crease brush and just buffed out the edges and then to highlight underneath my brow bone I took the single shadow and sugar for my waterline i'm using the wet and wild mega last retractable eyeliner in blackest black really good eye liner but I poked myself in the eye by mistake and my eyes were a little bit right for a second there which caused the black to smudge just a little bit because my eyes were so watery I took that copper shade i used on the lid and buff that on my lower lash line and then I took the crease shade I used earlier and did the same thing I wanted a little bit more depth on the outer corner so I took the shade called definer and just focus this on the outer corners of my eyes and then i went in with this wet and wild I need something with a while this is all wet and wild ok i use the mega liner in the shade dark brown and then I highlighted my inner corners with the brow bone shaved from the comfort zone palette but I didn't record it like it did not record i'm still trying to get used to this new camera but i'm going to contour my cheeks i'm going to use that contour duo in the shade due to the letter and obviously using the contour shade I'm just chiseling my cheekbones a little and then I wanted to warm up the skin this is the color icon bronzer in the shade ticket to Brazil yes it's a nice light color but it gives your face a little bit of warmth really really pretty i love love love this bronzer so much it even has SPF i love it is great for blush I'm using the color icon blush in the shade rose champagne another favorite of mine gives you such a pretty like natural Rosie flush to the cheeks these blushes last a long time on the skin as well liked then I took the highlighting powder in the shade precious petals and i'm highlighting the tops of my cheekbones with the Real Techniques setting brush and I'm also highlighting my nose with this powder as well for my lips I just took the mega last lipstick in the shade bare it all one of the best lipsticks ever if you want a nice nude and I thought that my face looked a little bit too Matt so I went in with the photo focus setting spray but I just like drenched my skin like I super drenched but yes I give me a nice little glow that completes this video that you guys so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right now I got really really requested to do a valentines day makeup tutorial but there's just so many people uploading them right now that I don't know if I wanted to but I thought you know what I'm going to sit down and film the look that I'm going around Valentine's Day so this is what i'm going to wear it's extremely extremely easy it's like the easiest i look in the history of the world it's so easy which is why i wanted to show you guys if you are someone who is just starting out and make up or you struggle a little bit with your eyeshadow i think this video is perfect for you because anyone can do this I look absolutely anyone because i mean it is so easy and basic but I love looks like this on valentine's day i love red lips for valentine's day it's my favorite and I know that red lips are extremely typical around times a day but i like it i wink I think this makeup look is beautiful for any date night you could switch up the lip color you could literally Christmas who could honestly where any lip color with this look absolutely any so you do what you want on the lips I just love red course so if you want to get this really really simple and glowy valentines day makeup then just keep watching ok so I'm going to start off with my face and my eyes are so simple i'm taking the dr brandt pores no more i bought this because of Nicole Guerriero so I'm just trying it out and I'm going to fill in my pores with this my foundation of choice today is the lorio Leumi cushion foundation i'm going to give you guys my thoughts really quick this is such a beautiful finish on my skin but i'm in the shade w2 and it's so weird you can't tell here in this clip but it's a little bit pink which is weird since its w - it's like the strangest thing it's only a little bit pink not something that's super noticeable but yes it gives a beautiful nice like fresh finish to the skin and it has really really good coverage so i'm just applying that to my entire face for concealer i'm going to mix two of them i'm going to take my LA girl Pro concealed in the shade natural and i'm going to apply this really really close to my lashes because my dark circles were pretty bad and this shade in natural has like a really pretty peachy undertone so for the rest of my face like to highlight I'm gonna take the bareMinerals stroke of light in the shade luminous - it's basically just like a highlighting concealer and I don't know if I like it kind of kicked up on top of this foundation I'm still going to give it another try because I've never tried it on top of another foundation because this was literally the first time I used that stroke of light thing but I was like looking in the mirror and it just seemed pretty key and I know it wasn't my la girl concealer because that's like a Holy Grail consider of mine so i don't know if it was the combination of this foundation and the bareMinerals thing but it's not my favorite so far ok so i'm setting my face or my under eye concealer with of course my trusty RC may know color powder and this is going to help my concealer from creasing so i'm going to go ahead and do my eyes I'm going to take my Smashbox 24-hour eye primer and apply that to my entire lid and then I'm going to take this milani almondy cream crayon stick thing and i'm going to apply this to my whole lid just so that to my whole with that sounded weird just so that i can cover up all the veins and stuff ok so the palette i'm going to be working with is the two faced natural matte palette i'm going to take the shade heaven and i'm going to set that base i put down and now i'm taking the shade new tea and I'm bluffing that on the outer corners of my eye with a nice fluffy brush and I'm just packing this on the outer corners just so that it shows up a little bit since it's a little bit light I'm just packing that on fucking it out and then i'm going to start blending this into my crease and is pretty much the only shadow we're putting on the lid just so that I can have a little bit of dimension in my crease that i'm going to highlight underneath my brow bone with the shade heaven the 1i use first and i'm also applying that to my inner corners as well ok so I'm going to takes expresso sex presso I find that so hard to say it's like a tongue twister I don't know and I'm taking this on a flat definer brush and I'm just applying this really really close to my lower lashes and really really close to my top lashes kind of acting like a nice brown eyeliner but I mean we're going to go over it here in a second so I'm going back into new tea and I'm just buffing that on my lower lash line you know nothing fancy same applies to my shadow there and I'm going to take a black eyeshadow this is what a wild Panther eyeshadow it's literally like a dollar and it's super black but I'm taking this on an angled brush this brush is from sigma and I'm just pretending like if it's a gel liner and i'm creating a really soft messy type of wing i really like doing these looks especially if you have a hard time with gel or liquid liner this gives you the illusion of a wing but it's much softer and I just think it's really pretty so that's what I'm doing I'm just creating a nice little wing as usual like you would do with any liner and it just looks softer I don't know I like it and then I just kind of extended the tail a little bit so it looks nice and long and then we're pretty much done with that wing it was so easy so I'm taking casual your bunny and I'm just buffing that on my lower lashes just to give a little bit more depth I wanted it to look a little bit smoky there i'm going to apply some black eyeliner on my waterline and my tight line as well this is black velvet from urban decay this is gonna define the eyes just a little bit more then I used my mac extended plank a black flash on my top and lower lashes and I'm letting my glue dry but I wanted to show you guys the lashes i'm using they are posh last year's posh lashes in the shade within the while in the style wispy I'm not even gonna edit that i'm just going to leave that it ok i'm taking my color pop highlight in the shade smoking whistles and applying that to the tops of my cheekbones with my finger and then I took my position for me love butter bronzer yeah that is the song I sing in my head every single time I open this bronzer because it smells like a tropical paradise but anyway i'm using this to contour because i really like the undertone and i used a Sephora Pro airbrush in this in this end up what in the number fifty-four that is the number of this brush number fifty-four I took a stippling brush and I dipped into my kiko flawless fusion bronzer I just wanted to add a little bit more warmth to my face so i'm just applying this all over my face and then I had to change my Spotify because a really emotional song came on if you are a vampire diaries fan and if you are a Stefan fan that song hits home it was a very emotional episode anyway i'm applying Mac warms always texting me i'm applying that warm sold my face and this voiceover is a hot mess but i'm also highlighting my face with becca shimmering skin Perfector in champagne pop and i'm just using a zoeva highlighting brush to highlight my fates of course and then I forgot something in my drawers and I wanted to do a little dance but I wanted to grab my girl lactic face glow in the shade natural because I wanted to be extra Khloe so I took my real techniques blush brush and I'm just pretty much applying this face glow all over my face just to be extra glowy ok so to finish off the look I'm going in with a red lip this is a mac pro longwear lip liner in the shade he said he said she said why is that hard for me to say i don't know but while I singing to selena gomez i am going to apply my Milania more matte lip cream in the shade desire it's a liquid lipstick and i love it so that completes this makeup tutorial i hope you guys enjoyed it this is what I'll be wearing on Valentine's Day thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you

month ago or two months ago already and I was wearing this exact makeup it was that same day and I got so many requests to do with the look I was wearing in that video and in this picture and for some reason I just forgot about it and never did it but then as the day's kept going on i noticed that every single day it was still being requested like I kept getting questions like what are you gonna do that tutorial using those away vako blend palette I get questions every single day so I'm so sorry that this video is going up so late I should have done this like a month ago but it is a tutorial using the soil tobacco blend palette if I'm gonna be completely honest with you I didn't want to post this I'm totally serious i wasn't going to because I mean this looks so similar to looks like hub i have already done even my own estas the one that i did recently looks a little bit like this but I don't ever want you guys to feel like I'm not listening to you and I'm not putting out videos that are being requested this is rose for you guys who wanted to see it I mean it is a little different because I normally would pair it with a nude but i love this lip with this look at the same lip i was wearing in that video the eyes are a little bit different because i don't exactly remember how i did it to be completely honest with you I don't really remember so I just you know winged it and it's kind of it's a very very very very simple makeup look it's a little bit messy like it's just like shimmer everywhere it's not very precise and very neat which i really like it gives it like a boho vibe and very summery I really hope you guys enjoy this makeup look at and if you want to see how to get it well just get it ok so my eyes are already primed and i'm just going to jump into these away but Coco blend palette i'm thinking the color pure ganache and i am putting this all over my eye it's a very intense gold beautiful color I love it so that's going to go in my inner corners as well just all over the place then I'm going to take this really pretty camel color it's called substitute for love and this is a crease brush by the brand lucky i got in an Ipsy bag and I'm just blending that into my crease very messily this look is not precise so even if you don't know how to blend much this is the look for you just throw it in there then I'm going to dip my brush into warm notes it's a stunning cranberry shade and I'm just putting that lightly on top of the gold just so that it can make more of a role as gold orangi kind of look like the two mixed together are really pretty then I'm going to take the color called freshly toasted very similar to max Browne script you know like in that family and i am putting that on the outer part and in my crease as well then I'm going

then I topped it off with the Mac prep and prime light boost yes in like boost this is the yellow one and then I'm going to take the mac highlighter and i'm just going to highlight the rest of my face with it I really liked that too much concealer so thank you so much to the beautiful subscriber who recommended it to me it's really really blendable I like it a lot thank you so you know the drill going to blend that in with my sedona lace 217 brush and just blend that in that too much concealers so threw me off the first time I used it because it's not a doe foot applicator it's like a little tiny brush just thought I'd let you know oh I was actually looking to the side right there because Cornelius importer we're having a full-on staring competition they were both like stiff as stones

i'm just going to line my waterline and my lash line with the Knicks treasure Lee eyeliner how to read that wrong i know i'm sorry anyway and that was the brown eyeliner by NYX then on a pencil brush

today's video is going to be a talk through makeup look on this look right here and I'm basically showing you my favorite like bulletproof makeup makeup that lasts all day on my face if i want to go somewhere and I know I'm going to be out all night I'll usually use these products and just change them up there are formulas that work really really well for staying in place for a long time at least on my skin i'm also going to be giving you a few like tips and tricks on how to like apply things and make them last longer and all that stuff so you guys know that I'm always very very open very very honest on my channel and this video is sponsored by skin to Naevia if you guys are not into sponsored videos which I completely one hundred percent understand then stay tuned for that in my next video that will be sponsored because this one might not be for you i will be using other brands in this video b-side Scandinavia but this video is partnered with them and I was very very excited because i love Scandinavia since i started youtube so yeah I mainly going to be talking about these two products from Scandinavia these are the sprays this is the primer spray and the makeup finishing spray I'm sure you guys have heard of Scandinavia because a lot of people use them as makeup finishers and they really make your makeup lasts all day this is actually one that i purchased myself this one was sent by Scandinavia but this one I purchase myself when if you guys are my i'm at all like my old i'm at all i bought it while i was at IMATS and I take this with me every single time I travel you guys don't seem to use some my channel at all but every time I go to Miami or California this bad boy comes with me because it works and honestly when I do tutorials on my channel I'm usually just home and i'll wear that make up for the rest of the day but i don't really need it to last all day because nine times out of ten I stay home I don't do anything ever um so I don't really show you guys me putting on like finishing spray because I even spray like setting sprays when i'm done with my makeup but i never do it in my videos because I just don't think about it so actually the story behind Scandinavia is really really cool the founder of skin the Navy actually came up with the idea to make these products is fairly new but came up with the idea to make like a finishing spray when he was in Miami like nightclubs in Miami had I live in Miami I'm from Miami but it's kind of funny to hear that story because he noticed that girl's makeup like in the nightclub like at the end of the night their makeup look like it was kind of like melting off like just sweating off which is understandable it's a nightclub I get sweaty in there I here I've actually never been to a club side note never ever been to a club in my life and I'm 23 anyway so he would go to Miami nightclubs and he would notice that make up on women when was not really lasting and it was just melting off so he thought of the idea to create his own line of makeup finishing sprays and you guys know people swear by scandinavia and they're actually a very very good brand in the Navy actually uses like temperature control technology i don't know how they do what they do which makes your makeup lasts all day and heat or humidity because it's just it's just made to control the oils that shine through the primer I'm not going to lie this is best for normal to oily get normal combination to oily skin i have dry skin and i still use this but i only use this when I know I need my makeup to last all day this is silicone free by the way and it won't clog your pores sometimes silicon can clog your pores a little bit so yeah a friend along i'm going to leave a link down below where you can purchase in the Navy your product I do a promo code with Scandinavia i will leave it down below I believe it's like Bridal or something like that i will leave the promo code down below it helps you get ten percent off + to travel size sprays + free us shipping which is a really really good deal really good deal it's not an affiliate link i just want to point that out if you click the link and buy something I do not get

link don't forget to click and yeah use the promo code so yeah if you want to see how to get this makeup look then just keep watching ok so i have already started out with moisturizer on my face now i'm going to use the scandinavian makeup primer spray so you want to make sure that when you spray this you're pretty far away you don't want to spray it like right here because you just have like a big blob of you wet mess Bobby witness moving on to foundation i love using my revlon colorstay foundation honestly it's probably the one that lasts most on my face aside from the makeup on her face and body this one is like glue as well but it's kind of luminous and lightweight lightweight lightweight i use the one that's for normal to dry skin for obvious reasons but if you have really oily skin I would use just the regular one and i'm just going to get a little bit bizarre it's a little bit song so I'm just going to mix it in I'm just gonna be like a hair just the hair of my 150 this foundation it's really full coverage so I like it when I'm going out to places and it does have SPF 15 but I don't think it looks bad and photography like sometimes foundations will give a really like gross flashback but I really don't think that this one does for concealers when I want a bulletproof concealer look I have to that I really love that is the urban decay naked skin concealer or the mac pro longwear concealer these two once they said they go nowhere a drive down to like a mat natural finish it's not do its not cakey and it doesn't fade throughout the day these concealers are the best today I'm going to use the pro longwear and nw20 going to use the Real Techniques contour brush to apply that underneath my eyes and usually like on a day-to-day basis I will just drag this up onto my eyelids and use this as my eyeshadow primer but i'm not going to do that today because when I want my makeup to last my eye makeup to last all day I like to go in with an actual eyelid primer because that works a little bit better ok so you guys know i don't typically set my face because my skin is so dry for the sake of this video i am going to set my face and especially if you have normal to oily skin you want to set your face even if you have dry skin it's just going to prolong the wear makeup i'm using my Rimmel stay matte long-lasting a pressed powder in translucent i'm going to set my concealer with this and set the rest of my face just a little bit with this powder I don't find it to be very very translucent like it's a little bit white but if you use it gently it serves its purpose I actually really like it i'm going to go ahead and move on to my eyes really quick before i finish the rest of my face ok so for my eyes I find because my eyelids are so dry that a lot of eye shadow like last a really long time but sometimes it's a little tricky when you have oily eyelids for your makeup to last all day on the eyes I have found the best primer for that is the NARS smudge-proof eyeshadow base this will not let any of your eyeshadow to crease so your eye shadow will stay intact the entire days kind of scary if you really want to take the extra step i recommend using cream eyeshadows more so like mac pro longwear paint pots they called prolong or just regular people pink Mac Paint Pots but I find that even these last longer than paint pots these are the maybelline color tattoos 24 hour cream my travels coaches so i am going to use this i'm going to use the one in chocolate sweet we're really quickly I want to apply a crease color I'm going to use the Too Faced chocolate bar palette this is a tried and true my favorite palette in the world these eyeshadows last on my eyelids and they're just fabulous so i highly recommend this palette i'm going to take this morphy e27 and dip it into this regular like brown shade we can you do it i'm doing a really really easy look for today because I want to mainly focus this look on the face makeup like how to make your face makeup lasts all day by the way i woke up today and I sound like a boy do I sound like a boy was i don't know why i don't know i am not sick I just broke woke up with like a very recipe voice today with that same brown color I'm going to take it onto my lower lash line by the way that brown color is called milk chocolate forgot to say that ok so for eyeliner you're going to want to find an eyeliner that really really holds well in your waterline whether that be a waterproof one it doesn't matter everybody's I lives are different and everybody's water line is different i feel so it's just about trial and error i would recommend trying ones that's a waterproof or like smudge proof and use those eye liners in the water line those tend to last longer this isn't waterproof but it stays a long time on my waterline this is the Knicks gel pencil liner in black and I'm just going to line my waterline with this and then a trick I always do a lot of people don't like to say that this is bad but I've never had a problem doing this a trick i always do is take I shadow and kind of set that I wonder we put down not like directly in the water line but i try to get it as close as possible to just set the cream and it lasts a lot longer so I'm going to take this dark brown color called amaretto no it's called triple fudge foot and why it's really close ok so now for the eye shadow like i said i'm going to use this color tattoo in chocolate suede this is a zueva can see their buffer brush and gonna pump pump what just gonna do this and then apply it to my lid the more product I blend out in a second yeah I'm gonna go back in with your hairless I should like a dog back into milk chocolate with this morphe brush i'm just going to blend everything out again ok so i just added a little bit more of that dark brown just to balance everything out earlier when I said I was doing a simple look I'm not easy not natural obviously i'm just going to quickly highlight with this color right here this is white chocolate and then champagne champagne champagne truffle for the inner corner then i'm applying mascara honestly just use your favorite like waterproof mascara or just your favorite mascara that you know doesn't flake throughout the day and last and holds the curl so I'm just going to apply my mailing the colossal volume and then I'll finish the rest of my face ok so now i'm going to finish off my face I'm sorry this video is so long already i'm actually going to apply a cream highlight to my cheeks first you never should put cream / powder and I already powder my face but I find that this is a really disturb what's underneath I'm going to use my cream color based in shell from mac and i'm going to apply this to my cheekbones because a really good tip on making your highlight last all day is to layer your highlights so i would suggest putting a cream underneath creams usually lasts longer and then powders and then put a powder on top to kind of set it and your highlight will stay there for a lil busy all day for contour I'm just going to quickly contour my cheekbones and really really lightly I mainly want to focus on the bronzer i'm going to use next but the contour going to use the caramel toffee wet and wild contouring palette and I'm going to use the contour side obviously just very lightly this is a morphy III just to create kind of like a shadow on my face because I really want to focus this look on some nests bronzer but this is going to just carve out the cheekbones a little bit I don't know if you can tell it just kind of gives a little bit of definition so with the same brush I'm going to bronze up my skin and when I want my brother to last all day this works this is the to face and list summer runser is a 16 hour long wear bronzer so it's supposed to last 16 hours on your skin I've never tried it for 16 hours but it does state on my face the entire day when i use it I'm just going to rub my brush in it and just bronze up my cheeks it is Matt you can go ahead and contour with this but it's a little bit it's neutral so you can control this what I just wanted to end ok so now I'm going along to blush and these are the best blushes if you want it to last all day I keep talking about all day all day but I'm a little repetitive blush is the first thing to go like when you put on your makeup at the end of the day usually you can't even see your blush like blushes the number one thing to fade on your face and on your face yes so I'm going to use the tarte amazonian clay 12-hour blush these blushes less forever on my cheeks any color works they have a huge selection of colors and i'm just going to use this one it was like the limited edition tartlet one in the shade celebrated because you know one of my eyes are dark I don't want to go like super pink just going to clean off this brush on a towel the same brush i was using and use it as a blush i'm obsessed with this brush side note morphy three if you haven't tried these 12 hour blushes they're good just going to add a little bit of color and honestly what I would recommend if you are putting on on blush and you're not going to touch up your face like if you have if you have to do your makeup and make sure that it lasts all day i recommend putting a little bit more blush than you usually would and now i'm just going to set that highlight I put down using the hourglass luminous light and i'm using this one because it's actually pretty natural and it doesn't look super frosty on the cheeks I have a lot of lip liners i am a lip liner junkie but to me the lip liners that lasts forever on my face are these la girl endless semi-permanent auto lip liner long lasting all day where they're not getting these semi permanent are like some permanent this in the shade and natural i'm just going to line my lips these are so affordable and there's so long wearing now because I don't want my lips to be this dark at all like it's too dark for this look I think you could I mean whatever i'm going to take the ELA all day liquid lipstick in the shade Rosa . and put it on top liquid lipsticks in general will be your best friend if you want your makeup to last all day and you don't want to retouch your lip product because they're like cement and they don't go anywhere so I'm gonna actually put some on my finger and blend this in if you want to throw on of lost you can just keep your gloss in your purse and we touch throughout the day since glosses don't last as long as like Matt products do so now for the most important stuff honestly I think it's even more important than the primer spray it's the finishing spray this is just going to set everything in place and make your makeup lasts all day this Scandinavia finishing spray is no joke I'm just gonna shake it spring and while that dries with my coffee it takes a minute or two to fully dry but that completes this makeup look it's nice and glowing and it will stay that way the whole day I really hope you guys enjoyed it let me know down below if you did and also so that we can all talk and all you know read each other's comments leave a comment down below what your number one bullet proof like makeup item is your number one item that you use that you're like wow this is super long wearing and i love it because it lasts all day leave it below I would love to know thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hello I look a little crazy right now because have this I semi done and this eyebrow done and I'm just like a mess right now I feel really really tired my hair is so crazy like this is actually my hair with no product in it but I really wanted to film this video so i didn't have time to do my hair and I just threw a braid on because my bangs were like out of control and I haven't even brushed my hair and I'm pretty sure that's a dreadlock so today i think i'm going to do a talk through tutorial because i haven't done one of these in a long time so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to fill in my eyebrows and I don't want to do such a crazy bowl eyebrow like I usually do this might even be too bold for some people but usually I filled them in a little bit more bold you know i'm going to use the elf eyebrow kit for this it's really cheap it's three dollars and it's perfect because you get a wax and a powder perfect because the wax keeps your hair in place for a really long time and usually people go to school for like eight hours a day so that's always great I'm just going to take the wax part first and just run it through my brows i'm using a little brush i got at michaels and it cost me like two dollars after that i'm just going to dip it into the powder and go over it to set the wax browse are completely optional I just feel like it's a little bit necessary for me even though in high school and never filled in my brows never but now I feel like oh I need to fill in moments this video is probably gonna turn into like a chit chat video which i hope you guys don't mind ok so now i'm going to move on to my eyes and going to zoom you in really quick to prime my eyelids i'm going to be using this milani shadow lies in the shade almond cream this is a great pencil because it lasts all day and it does not crease and it's great because it covers up all those veins on my eyelids have crazy things there so I'm going to take it pretty far up and then just blend it out and usually in the morning if you wake up to go to school really really early your eyes can be a little bit red and tired and this just kind of masks that next I'm going to take a fluffy brush like this I got this off morphe brushes com it was under six dollars and then I'm going to take this single eyeshadow from Milani and this is called Bella cappuccino it's just a nice mapped Brown and I'm going to take this and just dust it in the crease of my eye so right here right where your eye folds I'm just going to dust that right here this is just going to give some depth to the eye give it a little bit more color now you don't have to go this far and actually do your eye makeup in high school the only thing I want on my eyes with mascara like all through high school I didn't start wearing makeup - after so this really is optional but I didn't want to do a tutorial with just mascara next I'm going to take another milani eyeshadow this one is called Bella champagne you're really pretty champagne color champagne and i'm going to take this brush from Ecotools it's just a dual ended brush I'm taking the shading part i'm going to differ at in and apply this to the lid this is just going to add some light to your eyelids so it's not all flat looking now I'm going to take this Maybelline eye studio quad I'm not sure if this was limited edition i hope not I got it pretty recently at my CVS and this is in total tease I don't think it's limited edition but i'm not exactly sure and i'm just going to take this light color right here and I'm just going to dust this right in the inner corners and this is going to make your eyes look more awake going to bring light to the center now i'm going to take this dr. Toby shade right here I'm going to dip my brush and this is a little blending brush from Ecotools and i'm just going to dust this right on the outer corners just a little bit just to give a little bit more depth but you really don't have to do this part especially if you're in a hurry in the morning then I'm just going to add this light shade again right here underneath my brow bone just to make my eyebrows look a little bit lifted i'm going to quickly move on to the rest of my face before I finish up my eyes and honestly this part is completely up to you it depends on your skin type and all that stuff if you want to go ahead and put on foundation because that's what you feel comfortable with and go ahead and put on foundation you could also use a BB cream it's a little bit less coverage and a little bit more natural BB cream is perfect for you guys in high school or anything like that I just like to go ahead and take some concealer and a bit over the places where i think i need concealing it's not just diving in with a full face of foundation so i'm going to be using my Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade 0 light this is my holy grail concealer it's from the drugstore and it is fantastic so i'm going to go ahead and dab it in between my eyebrows because i have a birthmark there around my nose I know I've said it a bunch of times but I have this crazy weird vain can you see it it drives me nuts and make me look like a homeless - and then a little bit on my cheeks because they get some redness on my cheeks and then I'm just going to blend this in with my buffing brush from Real Techniques I do have some self tanner on so the rest of my body is darker than my face but I will fix that up with some bronzer yeah ok so once it than that i'm going to go ahead and try to hide my dark circles as best as they can especially when going to school I know you guys wake up really really early in the morning and i remember when i was in high school my dark circles were on another level so I'm going to take my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser this is probably one of my favorite products from the drugstore to put underneath the eyes it's just really easy it's an easy application and it covers pretty well so i'm just going to dub that underneath my ass I don't know if i set up but it's in the shade I have it in the shade fair and then blending that in with my Real Techniques contour brush now i have really really dry skin so i usually do not set the foundation or concealer on my face unless it's like a really do a foundation but this concealer I don't find that I need to set it on my face so I'm only going to set my under eye concealer because if I don't set that it will crease like crazy but if you have oily skin I definitely suggest setting your face with a powder because you're going to be at school for a long period of time so you want to make sure that nothing slips off or you don't get oily or greasy throughout the day so I'm just going to go ahead and set my under eye concealer i am using my fit me powder in the shade 135 creamy natural and i'm just going to set that ok so to finish off my eyes i'm going to go ahead and take the same milani pencil i used to Prime and i'm going to add this to my waterline and what this is going to do is going to make my eyes appear larger and more a week that's going to mask that redness that my waterline tends to have in the mornings when I little smudgy brush I'm going to take this color we used earlier and I'm going to run this underneath my lashes now i'm going to apply some mascara i am using my revlon gold lacquer grow luscious mascara the first i am going to curl my eyelashes now my eyelash curler is not from the drugstore but you can go ahead and use whichever eyelash curler you own one that i recommend from the drugstore that seemed to work pretty well for me was from Revlon so i'm going to go ahead and curl my lashes and then add a few coats of this to my top and bottom lashes and I'll be right back ok so after I've applied mascara I'm pretty much done I'm going to do now is warm up my face a little bit just to give my face a little bit more life and for that I'm going to use my NYC smooth skin bronzer in the shade sunny what it looks like just swirl my brush this is a real techniques blush brush and I'm just gonna warm up my face I feel like bronzer is really important either bronzer or blush because it's just gonna make you look alive and healthy so if you don't want to use a bronzer than just add some blush to your cheeks and if you don't want to use blushed and go ahead and add a little bit of bronzer to your face you know I'm the girl who prefers bronzer over blush personally that's just me but it's all about preference and honestly I'm just warming up my face you don't need to do crazy contour anything it's just school you know it's not ideal ok now for lips are really just depends on you i wore the exact same lipstick in high school since like my sophomore year I wore max pretty please every single day in high school like that was my signature lipstick i wore it every day I've gone through like four tubes of that lipstick because I wore it every day in high school but it depends on you i recommend something like wait like a lip gloss or if you want to go ahead and use a lipstick because it's going to last longer throughout the day go ahead and do that I'm apply my NYX butter gloss in the shade eclair these are great because they're not sticky and you just throw it in your purse apply between classes ok so that is the complete makeup tutorial i really hope you like this video like I said you don't have to do all this honestly this is probably even too much for me because I was the kind of girl who woke up very very late i didn't have time to do all of this actually have a video that i will link down below on five easy steps to get a if not flawless face but to get a well done dress the face so it's probably for those of you guys who leapt to the very last second hit that snooze button over and over and over again i will link that down below if you're more interested in a tutorial that is going to be fast and easy this is just if you have a little bit more time to leave a comment down below if you want to see back to school hair tutorials or something like that let me know give me some feedback thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys funny story actually not funny but I found a tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right now and go an itch cool each i found that earlier today and then I totally forgot to film an intro for it and then I was sitting here uploading all the clips to my computer and I was like I didn't come in and throw some time doing right now and that's why I'm sitting in front of my mirror as opposed to in front of the window like I am for this entire video I warned my eyes like this and a lot of videos recently or at least something like this in a lot of recent videos the look I was wearing in my last video which was the Ipsy bag video this basically was what i was wearing on my eyes this is my goal to smokey eye this looks good on everyone on extremely fair people on extremely dark people on people with brown eyes people with blue eyes people three nice this looks good on everyone and in this video i am using a bunch of different colors for a bunch of different palettes that I have but they are very neutral colors which means they're very doable so if you're watching this and you're like really you're busting out like seven different palettes like calm down you can easily find dupes for all these eyeshadows in your collection since they are so neutral I really hope you enjoy this tutorial it was requested i posted a picture on Instagram today of me wearing this makeup and people were like tutorial well that's what I mean I was going to total regardless but yeah if you want to see how to get this makeup you know what to do so the first thing I'm going to do is prime my eyelids with the Urban Decay's primer potion next I'm taking the maybelline color tattoo in barely branded which is this really pretty champagne color yeah and I'm not going to take this past the crease I don't want any shimmery shimmer eNOS in the crease next I'm taking my naked palette and I'm using this color right here called naked excuse my nails I have not painted them yet I've just been a disaster with my nails but anyway I'm taking this color naked right here and I'm taking it on a big blending brush like this and I'm going to put this into my crease yeah now taking this color right here called shroom it's from Mac I'm going to be putting this on my entire eyelid yeah yeah yeah now taking the color of book which is just the deeper Matt Brown in The Naked palette any medium matte Brown will work and i'm just going to work this and the outer part and into my crease I'm gonna take a little bit of this color right here called smart which is just like a very very warm bronze and I'm gonna work that the same places we put book yeah and now basically all i do is just continue to build darker colors into the crease and the outer part of my eye just to make it very very deep I start from light colors too dark just because it's easier that way I'm going to take this color here called Brown down it is from mac and i'm going to be doing the exact same thing yeah and I'm going to work it directly into the socket yeah yeah now i'm taking a black matte eyeshadow this is Panther by what a while and i'm adding some more depth to the outer corner of the eye just so that it's not all brown and I'm just packing it on and brush like this and slightly blending it in yeah now i'm taking this color right here from my ceiling and light palette is called bliss and just giving the look kind of a softer touch here on the crease this is just like a dusty rose color so we have like anything similar like a mommy brown that will work and now the last thing I'm putting on my lid is this color right here called naked lunch from mac and i'm just going to pack this on right here it's also going to be my inner corner highlight for my brow bone I'm just taking a matte beige color and hoping that right here now i'm just going to add some black eyeliner to my waterline and my tight line and then I'm going to do the rest of my face before I finish underneath my eyes the foundation i'm going to be using today is my absolute favorite drugstore foundation of all time and it is the revlon colorstay foundation specifically for normal to dry skin the other formula is way too thick and cakey I really love this formula so it's going to be popping this on my fires yeah I know what you're thinking girl that is too dark but it's not it matches my neck ok so far underneath my eyes I don't want to go to dramatic with the light concealer but i'm going to be using my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle racer and just covering my bags a little just enough for it over look sleepy just kind of like brightening up that under I just a little I'm not bringing it down all the way to here like I normally do just because I don't know because I don't always do that yeah i'm going to set that under eye concealer with my msf natural now i'm just going to finish putting some eyeshadow underneath my eyes just to make it a little bit more smoky and for that i'm going to be taking this brown color right here called Brown down from mac and taking that on a pencil brush like this just blending that underneath ok now I'm going to add a lot of mascara i like using a really volumizing first mascara for this kind of look just because I don't like to add some winged liner to this kind of look you totally can you can just add some winged liner and then some mascara it would look really pretty regardless if you do i just kind of like to leave it like this so i'm going to coat the crap out of my lashes with my Jordan best last we're gonna best / extreme and then i'm going to go ahead and fill in my eyebrows and then I will be right by so typically if I were doing this makeup look I would do like the whole contour blush and highlight like the whole shebang but today I'm just gonna brand my face a little bit i'm going to be using my little baby hoola bronzer and by the way i have been loving this bronzer it's really really good I can see why everyone loves it i'm going to be using my Real Techniques blush brush dip an idea and kind of runs my face normally when I would contour which is not so specific ok so for my highlight i'm going to be taking it's a new purchase of my name is become my absolute favorite highlight in the entire world and it is the josie maran argan aluminized sir it's the most beautiful champagne gold highlight which is my favorite kind of my life I'm just going to pump that on the back of my hand the only thing that this squirts out a lot more than what you need just the only thing i hate feel like like that's way too much but see that do you see the beauty and you yeah yeah yeah yeah for my lips I'm going to be using a combination of two things i'm going to be using Mac myth lipstick which is a crazy crazy nude this is like intensely new so I'm only gonna like tap it on my lips and then I'm going to top it off with the covergirl jumbo gloss balm and ballet twist and top it with that ok guys and that's it of course you can change the lipstick you want to wear you can go a little bit darker but i love how this looks looks like really light new pink lips anyway I hope you enjoyed this video please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next one hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i am wearing right now it is using the Too Faced chocolate bar palette the original chocolate bar palette AKA my favorite palette of all time it has been so so highly requested to do a tutorial using this palette since you guys know it's my favorite yeah I don't have like any tutorials using it i think i only have like one or two this is my go to look with this palette if I'm gonna go out at night time or if I'm just gonna go out like special events or something like that this is the look I always do anyone hear something funny i started doing this tutorial and I did my eyes first and then i do my face and then I always liked finish up my eyes before I contour and for my blush a lot what are anyway I completely forgot to do my lower lash line and i did my entire face i put on my lips take I was even ready to say goodbye and I realized oh my gosh I didn't even finish up my eyes so in this video you will see me do like my entire face put on my lip and everything and then I finish up my eyes so not to confuse anybody would I totally blanked so yeah i really hope you like this look let me know if you guys want to see another tutorial using this palette and if you want to see how to get this one then just keep watching ok so I'm going to prime my eyes with the kat von d primer i really like it because it covers the veins on my eyes but it's a little bit too dark for me but you could definitely see it on my lids anyway so I'm going into the chocolate bar palette and I'm going to take white chocolate and i'm going to set that primary down so that it's not sticky and this is a Sephora Pro brush and then i'm taking salted caramel which is probably my favorite shadow in this palette and I'm taking it on my morphe e23 brush and I'm just putting this into my crease but I'm putting a lot of it like I really want this crease color to stand out so i'm applying a look now i'm going into semi sweet which is another brown but a little bit cooler it's not as warm as a salted caramel and i'm applying this on the outer portion of my eye and then slowly dragging it into my crease i'm using a sophie 320 brush but it's just like a mac 217 you know that kind of shape so yes as you can see I'm just dragging it little by little into my crease now i'm taking triple fudge and I'm going to do the exact same thing with the same brush only i'm applying a little bit more to the owner outer corners because I really want the outer view of the I to be like saturated with the brown shadow so I'm just packing that onto the outer corners and then dragging it all the way in on my crease I'm going back and forth it takes a little bit of time because you really wanted to look gradient and not too messy so you don't want to apply too much too fast so just apply the color a little by little and build up slowly that's how you'll get the best application I took the color semi nope no salted caramel and i just applied more into my crease and i'm highlighting underneath my brow bone with white chocolate now i'm going to marzipan this is like my other favorite shadow in the pile of it and I'm taking that like on a flat shader brush and I'm applying this wherever I didn't put any of the brown shadows then i just applied some pics + and get back into the shadow just to intensify it a little bit more but i'm just applying this on the inner parts of my eyes and then I'm going back into triple fudge and blending those two colors together because i don't want like a harsh line between the triple fudge and the marzipan you know just making sure everything is nestled lady going right back into semi sweet i'm kind of sandwiching the two colors salted caramel and triple fudge making sure it's a nice gradient effect and then i'm taking creme brulee and applying that right on top of marzipan not too much but i just wanted a little bit of gold to shine through and then i'm going to apply some eyeliner this is the Maybelline lines the little I forgot how much i love this it's so easy to use this I love it so i'm just applying you know like a thin little wing or like it's in the line on top and I'm going to do it up like a wing but i'm not going to like just yet i'll show you in a little while I'm going to tight line with this Maybelline master skinny eyeliner i forgot to show this in my drugs to review i really like it so I'm just tightening with this and I'm taking this blink ultra thin liner look at how tiny this is this is like the skinniest little brush tip I've ever seen in my life so it's so easy to get a really sharp wing with this it's amazing from the brand blink and it's awesome for a wing amazing anyway so i'm going in with mascara and then i'm popping on some violet false lashes in I do for my face I am just applying my to face I'm hangover primer and i'm applying that to my whole face and then i'm taking my aqua foundation from cogiendo and i'm applying this with a wet and wild kabuki like flat top kabuki brush love this brush I really like this foundation it's not my favorite of all time but i really do like it leaves a nice do we finish it's just very expensive so I rarely use it on camera now i'm going to conceal my under eyes and this is the collection lasting finish concealer i believe what that's what it's called I got on Amazon because i cannot get that product in the States but I have to say I really really love it and then I mix it in with my wet and wild illuminating concealer pen thingy and i'm also highlighting my face with this as well I love this is from what a while it's like three dollars and it's awesome and then I'm just buffing and blending all of that in this is a brush from bhcosmetics it's just like they're pointed

makeup tutorial and I think it's perfect for those people who are afraid of wearing like blue and red eyeshadow it's a nice way to still incorporate red-white-and-blue in your makeup but it's still very worried about the same time ok so first I'm taking this maybelline color tattoo in the color barely branded it's just this very light champagne color and i'm just going to be putting this all over my lid but not passing the crease next I'm taking my milk jumbo eye pencil and i'm going to be putting this underneath my brow bone and in my tear duct area to really brighten it up and it's kind of my base for the eyeshadow i'm going to be putting their so I'm going to put a lot of it and then I'm going to blend it out ok now i'm taking my $MONEY cela in the light palette and I'm taking this color called kin it's like Sheila's most famous shadow and it's pretty much the same color as the face i put down on my eyelid so that's what I'm going to be using i'm going to take this i'm going to put it all over my lid [Music] I'm not going to pass the crease I don't want it too shimmery in my crease I'm just focusing it on the lid and i'm going to use this as my tier to highlight because i wanted to be very very bright in that area the milk I shadow base really helps brighten up that energy or duct [Music] now i'm taking this brown color called cork any like mid tone brown color will work i'm going to use this on my mac 217 brush and I'm going to work this into my crease I'm going to keep this directly in my crease I'm not gonna take it too far up or too far down but i'm going to put some in the outer corner just to warm up the outer corners of my eye a little bit [Music] ok so next I'm going to take a white matte eyeshadow this is just a white eyeshadow that in this NYX love in Paris palette so get any white matte eyeshadow work and i'm going to use this as my brow bone highlight this is just a big fluffy black brush from coastal sense [Music] so right here I am just lining my waterline with that same milk jumbo eye pencil ok so next I'm taking this matte blue eyeshadow from Mac it's broken and disgusting i know and i'm so sorry i do not know what the name of this eyeshadow is but i'm just going to put this on my waterline right here I'm fast-forwarding it because i'm just going back and forth dipping my brush into that color and putting on my waterline and I'm sorry I'm like not even that much in the frame it's really hard to film at this angle i don't know but basically I just lying the waterline with that blue eyeshadow i put it over the white bass i put in my waterline and now i'm just taking a pencil brush and dipping it into that same blue color and I'm just gonna smoke it out a little bit just so it doesn't look like just a straight harsh blue line I'm just blending it out a little bit [Music] ok so now I'm just taking my master precise liquid liner and I'm just gonna just do a nice long wing I tried to record this but of course it was a disaster I just I couldn't film myself I was out of focus it was it's really hard to film yourself putting on eyeliner but yeah basically I just winged it out a pretty long wing not too thick not too skinny and i also put on some mascara i use the Maybelline illegal links on my bottom lashes and clinically shoveling on my top lashes so here I'm just taking my cherry lip liner from mac and I'm going to line my lips with it because of course we're going to be putting on some red lipstick because what is the fourth of July without red lipstick and of course the iconic Ruby woo that is the lipstick i am wearing and so I'm just gonna fill in the rest of my lips with the Ruby woo lipstick and that's pretty much it i already have the rest of my face makeup on just to save some time but i hope you enjoyed this look thank you so much for watching please subscribe and i'll see you in my next video bye guys hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i am wearing right now it is very very glamorous it's nighttime appropriate I don't exactly know what I'm going to call this look but i wanted to do a nighttime look and incorporate like summary colors in it as well so this is what I came up with it's very nice inappropriate but it's also very summery and warm and i love how it looks you could totally wear this look during the daytime if you want to just don't add false lashes just regular mascara and you're good to go but these false lashes make it look very very like glamorous and the nighttime it's like almost too much for me because I'm not used to lashes and these are very very long these are really long lashes absolutely love how it looks and it's nice to get out of my comfort zone in terms of falsies every once in a while so yeah these are my favorite colors to wear on my eyes I'm using makeup geeks Vegas lights pigment all over my lid and it is amazing it is one of the prettiest pigments ever seen and it is super affordable and I have my baby amber lights underneath I just think it looks really really nice and very summery so if you want to see how to get this look then just keep on watching ok so I'm going to start by priming my eyes I'm using Mac's painterly Paint Pots not only two prime but the cover up those horrid veins on my eyes i'm gonna apply this to my entire I and underneath my brow bone as well next I'm taking a fluffy blending brush and Max soft brown eyeshadow and i'm going to apply this in my crease just a little bit just so that the pigment that i'm going to place on my lid transitions nicely and it's going to be our transition shade next I'm going to take the star of the show and it is makeup geeks Vegas light pigment and it's a beautiful coppery color it's amazing and because this pig man has a lot of glitter i am going to spray my brush with mac fix+ you can use eye drops if you don't have six plus but this is the kind of pigment that really needs something like fix+ because if i were to apply it without it would just be like a bunch of little sparkles all over my eye and the fix+ really intensifies it and just makes it so much prettier so i'm going to apply this to my entire lid right up to my crease [Music] next on my mac 217 i'm going to go into the color saddle by Mac this is just like a medium brown with a lot of like red to it's a very warm Brown and I'm just gonna start blending out this pigment little by little this part is pretty tedious i go back into the saddle color over and over again and just slowly but surely start to blend the saddle color into my crease and blend away any harsh lines that the pigment made so like I said it's a little tedious just go back and forth and slowly bring that color up then I'm going to go back into my love be blending brush and blend out any harsh edges then back into the 217 with some more saddle and just slowly defuse this color and start bringing it up and blow it out into the crease and again some more back and forth [Music] now i'm just going to take a makeup wipe and clean any of the follow and then add a sharp cat I to my eyeshadow so once i do that and get it nice and sharp as you see here it looks nice and sharp i'm just going to go back into the color soft brown by mac and add some to my crease I'm going to take this i call from mac and think it's called coaster reach coaster Richie coaster each not exactly sure but it is a nice warm brown have like red undertone to it and it's really beautiful I have repurchased this numerous times i love it and I'm just adding that to my waterline and my timeline and then i'm going to go ahead and prime my face with Too Faced primed and poreless primer and then the foundation i'm going to be using is my l'oreal true match and three natural stuff and i'm using this with my Real Techniques sponge I've actually been using this a lot more than my Beauty Blender a kind of neglected my blood my Beauty Blender a little bit so this one is just so amazing you can get it at the real on the Real Techniques website or an ultra calm i recommend it's very inexpensive and just as good as the Beautyblender it does soak up a little bit more product than the Beautyblender does in my opinion but it's really good next I'm going to add my concealer i'm using my boo cover up concealer and just applying it underneath my eyes to cover my dark circles and to highlight my face as well have seen me do this part a million times but i'm just letting it out with my finger and then I'm going to blend it out some more with my self-appointed foundation brush I'm going to do that to both eyes of course [Music] to set my under eye concealer to prevent it from creasing i am using Mac's emphasize powder and just dabbing that underneath my eyes I have to set my under eye concealer because I'm not it will crease on me so this just prevent creasing now i'm going back onto my eyes I'm using the bombs winged eyeliner this is a great high-end liquid liner it's probably my favorite one dries matte and it's super easy to use I'm just going to add a thin line i'm not gonna wing it out or anything just the really thin line i'm gonna take my clinic / doubling mascara and i'm gonna apply a very thin coat of this to my lashes because i will be going in with falsies and the falsies i will be using our the red cherry 217 and I'm not used to applying them on camera yet so forgive me I have to apply them off camera that takes forever but then i'm going to move on to underneath my lashline and i'm using Mac's amberlite this is my all-time favorite eyeshadow you guys know this it's so beautiful and i'm just going to apply a generous amount underneath my lashes and being very sloppy with this because I wanted to be like everywhere underneath my lashes then I'm going to clean my pencil brush and apply max nylon to the very inner part of my I like the tear duct area just to highlight and i love this eyeshadow for the internet that's beautiful then for underneath my brow bone since there's so much shimmer going on i'm just going to take a matte cream color and apply this underneath my brow bone here i'm using the cream shade in my lorac Pro palette just any mac color will be fine and then i'm going to apply a thin coat of the clinic mascara to my bottom lashes i'm gonna add some bronzer to my face and I'm using the NARS Laguna bronzer this is such a beautiful summer bronzer because it has a little bit of sparkle in it but it doesn't really come off when you put it on your face it's just very warm and beautiful so I'm going to contour my face with this i am using the papered highlighting brush from sigma I'm just gonna fly this around my forehead and you know other places where you know contoured [Music] then I'm gonna add some blush I'm using milania's Luminoso blush it's a beautiful like warm peach but I'm only adding just a light wash of this to my cheeks nothing too crazy and then for my lips I'm using Revlon's smoke peach lipstick and i'm just going to dab this on a little bit i don't want too much pigment to come off and then I'm going to top it off with NYX butter gloss and fortune cookie i have been using this non-stop you guys know i've been using it like crazy so I'm just going to add that right on top ok so that completes this nice copper summer night makeup look I really hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys todays video is a tutorial on this makeup right here and this had to be a voiceover unfortunately because when i filmed this I was still trying to get over my cold but it's a really intense look and it's perfect for new years eve so the first thing I'm gonna do is take my Urban Decay primer potion and i'm gonna be putting this all over my lids as my primer then I'm taking some tape putting it in the back of my hand a few times and then putting that on the side of my eye to create a cat eye effect and then taking my NYX jumbo eye pencil in black bean i'm going to put this on my lid and then blend it out with a brush and I'm not going to be taking this past the crease I'm going to take max torque I shadow and i'm gonna be using this to blend this color into my crease this look takes a lot a lot of blending a lot of dedication and blending it's just you gotta really blend these colors into the crease this is what's going to make it look nice and smoky and blown out i'm going to take this color right here it's off from mac and it's called Brown down and then with a more precise blending brush I'm going to be putting this like directly into the socket of my crease and then blending it up to get it again like blown out and more smoky i'm going to go back and forth between blending brushes and make sure that it's nice and blended now i'm taking the showstopper of this tutorial and it is this pigment called utopia it is by make a peak and it's amazing i'm going to spray fix+ on my brush and dip it into the cap and then start patting this on my lid that fix+ really makes a difference with this eyeshadow it just makes it look old and metallic and so intense and I'm obsessed with it so I want to get it really precise right up to my crease and I'm not gonna take it pass there because it's going to be a glittery mess if I do then I'm taking that browndown color again and I'm going to start blending some more like I said it's just a lot of crease blending this is just the tricky part of the whole tutorial is just really getting those priests colors blend it out so just go back and forth and I really take my time with this yeah yeah now i'm taking max room as my brow bone highlight and my inner corner highlight as well then i'm taking my Maybelline master drama eyeliner and midnight master and I am tight lining with this and also putting this all over my waterline from my eyeliner I'm using the NYC liquid eyeliner and I'm you doing a very thin line because I really want the glitter and the pigment to really stand out so i'm just doing it very thin then i'm taking max carbon on a very very small shader brush and I'm putting this in my crease very precisely this is kind of like a soft cup priests because it's not it's not a full-blown cut crease it's not as dramatic as a cook crease but kinda like the same concept where I'm just really putting it into the crease very precisely i just go back and forth and I blend that out that's why I'm fast-forwarding this because I'm not this video would be like 45 minutes long it's just a lot of blending like i have said 50 times already I'm just taking off the tape and then cleaning around my eye I'm going to take browndown and much that underneath my lower lashline and then kind of them out of the frame I know I'm terrible but I'm just softening up the edge of that cat I because i don't want it too sharp and then take cork by mac and I'm doing the exact same thing I'm seeing my mascara I'm using my wedding while Michael volume and my jordana best / extreme and I'm just packing on this mascara you totally could use false lashes I think that false lashes will look beautiful for this look but you know me guys I'm not really a fall / where but you go ahead and go on which bed so if you do I have priming my face with my L'Oreal True Match Lumi primer and then i'm taking my urban decay naked skin foundation and putting this all over my face is perfect for New Year's Eve because it photographed beautifully i'm taking my mac prolongwear concealer and i'm using this to cover my dark circles and to right underneath my eyes this is also perfect consider for new years because it lasts all day and it does increase and it doesn't cake and it's perfect for that then I'm taking my mac msf natural to just set that concealer I'm taking my benefit hoola bronzer and i'm using this to contour my face and two bronze up my face a little bit i'm not going to like a super dramatic like eight contour but i do want to chisel out my cheekbones a little bit for this look now taking the next blush in the color mom think it's called pressure and i'm just adding this really lightly on my cheeks there's so much going on in my eyes that I don't want too much going on my base then i'm taking my mac mineralize skinfinish and soft and gentle as my highlight i'm taking my angel lipstick and then i'm going to top it off with NYX butter gloss and creme brulee as per usual love this gloss and that completes the look thank you so much for watching guys subscribe you haven't already and I'll see you next time hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing I wanted to do something around the theme of just like one color like a monochromatic kind of look kind of like a dusty rose eyeshadow blush and lipstick kind of look actually my liner is a lot bigger than I wanted it to be but it's ok actually really like how it turned out for those of you requesting a very like springy dewy fresh natural makeup that is coming up soon i wanted to do something a little bit more bold and dramatic first since i rarely do looks like this so yes I really use winged liner because i suck at it but I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone more and more every day basically if you know how to do winged liner then this is the easiest look of life the only difficult part is the winged liner because it's literally the easiest I look known to man so yeah if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching ok so I'm going to be priming my eyelids with the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion this is the new one well i mean i want to say new but it's pretty new and it's in the shape even i believe and then i'm going to set that with some translucent powder so to start off this I look I'm just using two shadows this one is from NARS it's one of their dual intensity eyeshadows it's in the shape qari and i'm just adding this as my transition shade you can totally skip this step because you could do that with this eyeshadow as well this is the star attraction this is colour-pop superstock super shock shadow in models wwat tles yes models that is what I'm putting on my entire lid and in my crease as well when you're working with color pop shadows in the crease make sure you're using like fluffy synthetic brushes because they just work best with the colour-pop formula so i'm using all synthetic brushes here to highlight underneath my brow bone i just used a light-reflecting powder this is a setting powder from laura geller just using that to highlight Oh little bit underneath my brow bone nothing too crazy and then i'm going to tight line with the next specially liner in jet black or pitch black yes pitch black and now to apply this wing ok guys I cannot do my wing on camera because i have to get super close to the mirror but just do your wing the way you would normally do it my wings got a little cray-cray as you can see here a thicker than a snicker I didn't want them this thing but we're going to go ahead and go with it I think it's cool to have bold line every once in a while so I just prime my face with the Knicks born to glow illuminating primer and then i'm going in with foundation this is the benefit hello flawless oxygen while foundation this was the first time I used it I am using a more feet esox brush to apply this and i really like the foundation is a little bit too yellow for my undertone I have more of a neutrally undertone but it's a really pretty foundation I forgot to show you the concealer i was using so I'm holding it up here this is the Maybelline better skin concealer and i'm just applying this underneath my eyes to cover my dark circles and to highlight my face but you've seen me blend in concealer about a million times right so i don't have to show you every little thing just blend netted i'm going to set my under eye concealer with my cosmetics bye bye pores powder i'm using a Sephora Pro 90 brush to apply this and I'm also just applying that on any area where i applied concealer and now to finish up my eyes i'm going to apply some nude liner this is the Rimmel scandaleyes nude liner i believe it's called nude and then I'm going to take models one more time and apply this to my lower lashline just that it can match with little lint matchy-matchy for mascara i'm actually not going in with my kiko one surprisingly i'm going in with the it cosmetics superhero mascara then I applied some falsies and i'm highlighting my inner corners with makeup geek whimsical eyeshadow and that completes the is I'm moving on to Z face right now I'm going to take the Prime and fine catrice contouring palette I got this at ulta and it was so affordable i think it was like under three dollars and it doesn't really nice job at contouring I like the undertone and it blends out really really nicely and then i'm going to just warm up my skin a little bit using this elf mineral bronzer in the shade tan toffee and with a morph a stippling brush I am just loving this onto my face to just add a little bit of warmth to the look so for blush I'm actually using the eyeshadow using my crease earlier this is the NARS dual intensity eyeshadow and khari and yes I'm using i thought i was a blush because why not I just wanted everything to match really nicely and I think this is a really pretty blush so moving on i'm going to highlight the tops of my cheekbones using the Natasha Nona glow powder in the shade light 1 I'm just blending that on the tops of my cheekbones and on my nose to highlight and to finish off the look I'm going to add some lip liner this is the Aquarius lip liner by color pop and then right on top of it i'm going to go in with another color pop product this is choker I believe yes choker Libby stick that's going right on top of the Aquarius lip liner this is a cream finish i really like this lipstick so that completes this video I hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on this look right here I think this is the first makeup tutorial I've ever done where I'm completely matte I'm like Matt guys I'm Matt I'm looking at my skin of clothes and I'm not used to ever looking this map but I kind of like it actually did a little bit of highlight on the tip of my nose I don't know why but I did I love this look I think it's very sexy and smoky but very simple at the same time I feel like this is the perfect look for anything any kind of occasion if you're going to a wedding if you're going to a baby shower if you're going to prom if you're going to graduation it's not super plane but it's not dramatic either you know it's somewhere in between and I love wearing this look with no falsies like just a ton of mascara I know I've been thinking this isn't like every video but I was smelling a candle and I accidentally burned off some eyelashes it's a long story but since i couldn't put on just mascara along this side because you couldn't see anything i decided to add individual lashes on this I only and hopefully it doesn't look bad this look is so pretty for those of you with green eyes or brown eyes or hazel eyes I think the pinky purple e tones in the brown I Federals really complement those colors but anybody can wear this so you have you want to see how to get this one hundred percent Matt makeup look then just keep watching ok so I'm going to start off by priming my eyelids i'm using the Urban Decay primer potion in the shade enigma I've really been liking this because a cover-up it covers up all my veins I'm taking this anastacio eyeshadow in the shade bone to kind of set that primer down and then I applied some tape to the corners of my eyes to create kind of like a cat eye effect make sure when you are doing this you put the tape on the back your hand a couple times so it doesn't stick to the skin I took the Anasazi eyeshadow in the shade Gary and I was just applying that into my crease and buffing that close to the tape and then I took another anastacio eyeshadow this one is in the shade birkin and I'm pretty much doing the exact same thing I am bluffing this into my crease but also applying it to the outer corners as well I took this NARS eyeshadow in the shade sophia and i am just bluffing that on the outer corners and into my crease as well I'm pretty much doing the exact same process with all the shadows only I'm going from light to dark to create kind of like a gradient effect with these colors I went back into de-rate by anastacio and I'm just blending out the harsh edges in my crease so everything is nice and blended so this is another nars eyeshadow this is in the shade Coconut Grove it's kind of like a super dark matte Brown and on an angled brush this is an angled brush from zoeva i'm creating a winged eyeliner but it's going to be a lot softer and a lot easier to do because you're doing it with eyeshadow so it won't be as harsh or as hard to do so i'm just getting really close to the tape the tape is kind of like my guideline to create that wing you see what I'm doing so I'm also taking a little blending brush and buffing some of that coconut rogue ride and the outer corners really close to the tape just like can be nice and blended and then I went back in with the angled brush and coconut grove and sharpen that up a little bit i'm taking anastacio bone again and i'm using this to highlight underneath my brow bone and now we can move on to see face while it took off the tape and now i'm moving on to the face i'm using the NYX angel real primer to prime my face for foundation and the foundation I'm using today is the clinique beyond perfecting foundation I have the shade linen I really like this nomination when I want to look a little bit more mad because it has kind of like a satin finish it's not completely mad but on my dry skin it does look a little bit like satin need you know I like it I like it doesn't look at drying or anything to go underneath my eyes I thought that the collection perfect lasting concealer was literally ideal for this look because it is a mac concealer I don't know how to explain it but it blends out really well and has great coverage but it doesn't look dewy under the eyes at all so if you have an oily under eye area i really suggest this concealer it's a very of a don't know what I'm doing there but it's very inexpensive and it has great coverage to set that i'm using the it cosmetics bye bye pores powder and i'm applying that underneath my eyes with the morphe 8 brush or e 46 i believe so I'm just setting that so it does increase underneath the eyes and then I thought you know what I want to be mad so I'm just going to go ahead and set the rest of my face I probably should have switched brushes because this is very little for the whole face but whatever I want with it so to finish off the eyes i'm taking the essence smokey liner this is like a casual liner like a coal liner in black really black really awesome great for smudging i took the NARS eye shadow in the shape coconut grove and I'm just buffing that really really close to the eyeliner to create kind of like a smoky effect and then I went into the NARS eyeshadow in the shade sophia and i pretty much the exact same thing making it nice deep and as smokey I took the Anasazi eyeshadow in the shade dairy one more time and just bust that underneath my lower lash line with a pencil brush so it's not too harsh or too dark and i decided to go in with some individual lashes on my left eye you guys know accidentally burn them off with the flame of a candle long story but i decided to pop them on my left eye I didn't do it on my right I do you think it looks bad i don't know i think it doesn't look too bad i put on some jordana best / extreme mascara and then popped on some ardell individuals on my left eye and I think that it balances out pretty well I just highlighted my inner corner with that bone shadow so to finish off the face I'm taking the physicians formula butter bronzer and I chose this bronzer because it's not completely like one hundred percent matt has a little bit of life to it not like shimmer or anything but a little bit of life to it so I thought it would complement this look really well and then for my sheiks i decided to go in with a bronzer by urban decay this is in the shade sunkist but it's too pinky tone for the whole face so I like using it on my cheeks i think it gives you like a really pretty gorgeous summary look to the cheeks nice and warm really pretty as a blush I wanted a little bit of something like a little bit of highlight so I took the laura mercier Matt highlight and i just bought that on my nose I don't know why but i did so for the finishing touch i'm going in with these you a liquid lipstick in the shade due to the lecture I thought it complemented the eyes perfectly and that completes the look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing it is literally the easiest I look ever I know I say that a lot but this one is really easy yet still looks nice and sultry and smoky perfect for beginners really excited for this one because today's video is sponsored by she sado i'm going to be using their synchro skin lasting liquid foundation in today's tutorial and I will go into detail about this guy in a second i'm usually the shade golden - but in today's video I mixed a little bit of golden for in with this because gold into is too light and golden force too dark so I mixed a little nibble but besides that I love this look and this I look was created with really really affordable products so yes if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching so please excuse my eyes and also excuse my voice I am sick at the moment I'm going to take the hard candy hydrating primer missed and spring that on my face and then i'm going to prime my face using the NYX angel veil primer and for foundation I'm going to be using the shiseido synchro skin lasting liquid foundation this foundation comes in 11 shades and it was actually designed to synchronize with your skin so that it can look really natural when you apply it which I totally agree with by the way I think that once i apply this this looks really really natural on my skin shiseido is actually known for their skin care and all of their foundations have skincare benefits in them which is pretty cool also this foundation is oil-free it has SPF 20 but I don't find that it gives me a white cast and photos I tried with my camera and i get 0 flashback in photography I also think the coverage is great i'm not sure if you can tell but it does a great job of covering up my redness but i do think it's buildable I think it's a medium coverage but definitely buildable because it feels just so weightless on the skin so moving on i'm going in with my concealer this is the Catrice camouflage concealer and this has great coverage so obviously i'm using it because my eyes are very very red at the moment so I'm just blending that in with my Real Techniques sponge - and then i'm going to set my under eye concealer using my NARS translucent crystal powder - for my bronzer i'm going to be using this bareMinerals bearskin sheer son serum bronzer it has a long name but I love this liquid bronzer I think it's one of my favorite later bronzers I've ever tried I guess because it's a serum it just blends really really well on the skin so i'm just applying that to my face to not only bronze up the skin but contour a bit as well i'm going to take this elf total face powder I'm gonna dip my brush into the bronzer shade in this palette i'm just going to warm up my skin with this color I really like this bronzer because even though it is warm it's subtle and it's not like an orange you warm it's very very flattering ok I'm just going to take the blush in this palette this is like a really peachy pretty blush i'm just applying this with my Sonia Kashuk blush brush and now moving on to the eyes i'm taking this milani shadow stick in the shade cafe au lait it's a really pretty cool tone brown I'm just buffing that onto my lid with a synthetic brush I'm gonna take the Sonia Kashuk I on neutral matte palette and I'm going to take this mix crease brush I'm taking this really like brown shade and blending this into the crease you just kind of get rid of any harsh lines then I'm going to take the wet and wild single eyeshadow in the shade nutty this was a super affordable product i think it was like two dollars and I am just applying this to my entire lid and I'm gonna go back into that brown shade and just stuff it some more you know no harsh lines blending monday morning this is another single shadow from the brand wet and wild it's called sugar and i'm using this to highlight my brow bone but to highlight my inner corners I'm taking the elf baked blush in the shade pink tastic i'm going to type line with a black eyeliner and also apply some to my waterline and then blend it out with a little angled brush this was the next regularly black gel liner i'm going in with this wet and wild eyeshadow another single eyeshadow this is in the shade panther it's a really rich black and I'm just gonna use this as an eyeliner instead of using a liquid liner or a gel liner i'm just going to take an angled brush and dip it into the eye shadow and create an eyeliner this way it's very very beginner friendly and so easy to do so then I'm going to go on my lower lash line and just buff out that brown shade just so that the black doesn't look too harsh and unblended so I'm just popping on some mascara this is the key go extra scoop the volume mascara and then i'm going to go ahead and bronze my skin a little bit more i just wanted a little bit more bronzer I was feeling more randomness so I'm taking the NARS Laguna bronzer and just applying that to my face and then to highlight the tops of my cheekbones I'm taking elf baked blush and pink tastic the same product we use on the inner corners just to give my face that glow and then for lips my lips are naturally very very red and pigmented as you can see so i just take a little bit of concealer and I just wanted to like new out the color of my lips so just blend that out and then apply the NYX butter gloss in the shade fortune cookie and then that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right now it is very dramatic for me but it should be it is a new years eve makeup tutorial and whenever I think of New Year's Eve I think a really dramatic makeup it is mainly using the Gwen Stefani palette by urban decay I used mainly these shadows but i did use this bad boy here this is probably the star of the show this is the colour-pop eyeshadow in the shade telepathy it's the color have all over my eyelids this of course is the eyeshadow i created with the where the night is quad which this quad is available to purchase right now this is my newest collab with color pop and i will link this down below i will link where you can purchase this little quad down below so i know that some people might not like this because it is like a very harsh kind of islets not to blended but i really like that for new years eve i think it's different it's fun so yes I hope you guys enjoy and if you want to see how to get this makeup look then just keep watching ok so I've already applied my eyeshadow primer and i'm applying some tape to the sides of my eyes to create a sharper look I'm going into the Gwen Stefani palette but with urban decay and I'm taking the shade Anaheim and i'm using this as my transition shade i'm applying this into my crease so that all of the other eyeshadows can blend a lot easier going into this street called zone it's a little bit warmer and deeper than anaheim i'm going to take the exact same brush this is a Sephora Pro crease brush probably my favorite crease brush of all time and i'm applying this really really close to the tape and then dragging it into the crease that is the main technique i will be doing throughout this whole video I'm gonna take the red shade in the palette it's like a really dark rider it's my favorite shades in this palette and I'm taking as a way of a brush that looks pretty much identical to the mac 217 and i'm going to start applying this eyeshadow directly like on the tape and then dragging it in the same way I did with the crease brush and then I'm going to take a blackout and apply this again really really really close to the tape and then dragging in I want like a gradient effect from the tape to the inner corners now I'm going to take the colour-pop super shock shadow in telepathy and i'm going to start taking it on my finger i'm applying this pretty much everywhere there isn't the black eyeshadow and then i went in with a synthetic brush to be a little bit more precise and I went in with the same so a brush and I'm starting to blend these colors together I didn't want like a cool harsh line which it is what what ended up happening but I wanted to make sure that it didn't look too harsh that everything was just a little bit more blended I went into the shade blondie or blogs i'm not exactly sure and I use this to highlight my brow bone then I went to this really really pretty gold it has a little bit of green to it so it / pairs perfectly with telepathy and I use that to apply to my inner corners and then I am priming my face with the Bekaa backlight primer i love it when i took my Maybelline fit me matte and poreless a foundation can I speak today my foundation hit me not important and applying that to my entire face i really really really love this foundation and i'm using a Sephora Pro air brush to blend that in and then I got this concealer on amazon when I was like shopping for some UK makeup and this is the Rimmel wake me up concealer so i'm just applying this underneath my eyes and other places I would highlight this is the first time i used it and actually really really like it i think it's very similar to the Maybelline better skin and Maybelline fit me Oh yeah i was watching a really emotional episode of the flash so I was like crying and really really trying not to mess up my makeup but anyway just blended that in like you've seen me do a million times and to set that i am using my NYC translucent setting powder I just got this to test it out and i really like it didn't look cakey underneath my eyes which I usually have that problem ok so back to the eyes before I finish my face I'm going to take zone again but I'm taking it on a pencil brush and I'm applying this all the way on my lower lash line from outer corner to inner corner and i'm taking my holy grail black eyeliner and i'm applying this to my waterline and this is the Knicks gel black eyeliner and i'm applying this to my tight line as well but not all the way in so I'm taking black out and i'm only going to apply this shadow on the outer corners of my eye I want the inner corners to be nice and bright and like green gold I'm going back into that gold and i'm applying this in my inner corners again just to intensify them a little bit and then i'm applying it a little bit on my lower lash line and I'm going back into telepathy and i'm applying this on the inner part of my lower lashline just so that i can match with the top part of my lid so i'm going in with some falsies and these are the velour still clashes that they made with some for other not mink they are soaked and um they're pretty good i like them so i'm going to contour my face using the morphe and the contour palette and I'm gonna contour my face with the shade I . that I'm just contouring like I usually do warming up the skin you know you know and now i want to brighten up my under eyes so I'm taking this really like shade in the palette and on my real techniques setting brush i'm just applying this underneath my eyes to really brighten up the look and I'm not really into this whole baking trend i don't i don't really do it at all but I think for new years eve for like a special occasion it it does look really nice so I'm just doing that underneath my contour to make my contour a little bit more visible and then I'm just brushing it away a couple minutes later and it really does help make your content look nice and sharp so for blush I'm taking my favorite blush of all time I just goes with everything this is nars madly blush it's my all-time favorite and i'm just applying this on to the sheiks and then i'm going in with highlights this is the Knicks illuminator in the sheet of ritual istic and I like it but it takes a lot of building up its kind of like a stiffer formula so it's not really intense it's not bad it's just um I really have to build up for the color to show and I'm going to go in with this 24 of collection lip liner in the shade nudists but it was a little bit too purple for me so I want i wanted something a little peach here so i took the kat von d liquid lipstick in noble and I applied it on top and then that completes this look I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's to do is another tutorial using the Urban Decay electric palette it is mainly well pretty much only using thrash and gonzo it's a little bit wearable i feel i would definitely go out and rock this and where this which I am today about you guys did ask me if I could do some more tutorials using this palette and of course I will absolutely why not I think people are kind of afraid of that palette because there's just so many crazy colors in it but you don't have to use all of those colors you can use different eyeshadows with those colors more neutral ones more wearable ones you could use that palette for like a pop of color one day in the spring and summer I just think that people are a little bit overwhelmed with the palette because there's so many colors and like nothing neutral you can kind of mix imagine you can come up with wearable looks with that pilot believe it or not this look right here maybe wearable for some people and for others and maybe like whoa even that's together phone too intense for me so I mean it's all about preference some people like it some people want but it's fun to experiment with colors I feel since i'm a very neutral girl so I'm really loving this palette so far so if you want to see how to get this line green and teal look then just keep watching ok let's do this i'm priming my eyes with Mac's painterly Paint Pot and i'm going to take this all over my lid and up to my eyebrow then I'm going to take an eyeshadow that is pretty much the exact same color as my skin tone and I'm going to put this all over my lid and underneath my brow bone to highlight as well I'm going to take an eyeshadow this just a couple shades darker than my actual skin tone or not even a couple shades just like a shade darker than my skin tone and i'm going to be blending this into the crease and this is gonna be our transition color use any eyeshadow you have now i'm going to go into this color here called thrash and it's just a very intense lime green and I'm taking it on a little blending brush from Ecotools and i'm going to be building this color into my crease very very slowly i'm gonna be packing it on the outer part of my eye and then bringing it into my crease and i'm going to be doing this over and over and over again this look especially requires a lot of blending and just going back and forth into that eyeshadow and building it up to the intensity that you prefer so i'm going to be doing that i'm also going to be dragging it up past my crease a little bit just to let everything is nice and blended and it's not a harsh straight line just take your time with this and build up that green color little by little yeah yeah I'm gonna go back into that eyeshadow i use all over my lid and I'm just gonna add some more to my lid because some of it did get blended away i'm going to be doing this quite a few times just going back and forth like I said into the green intensifying the green and then intensifying the litter aided by the way if you're wondering what I use on my linen in my crease they are the match shuttles from the kat von d ladybird palette but you can use whichever eyeshadows you now on a more precise blending brushes stiff dome brush I'm going to take it and dip it right into trash and then just apply it right into my crease to intensify my crease a little bit more really quickly I'm going to tightline and I'm going to use my Maybelline master drama in midnight master and then I'm gonna add my wing every time i do my wing it gets out of focus i know i suck but i just did a pretty thin wing on top and then did a nice long look I'm going to go back into the eyeshadow i use all over my lid one more time just to intensify it because you know some of it did get blended away and i'm going to be focusing it on the center of my eyelid and towards mightier duct yeah yeah yeah really quickly I'm going to curl my lashes and use my Too Faced better than sex mascara policies would be more ideal for this look but you guys know I don't really use falsies that much I feel free to use them I'm going to prime my face with the Maybelline Baby skin and then i'm going to go in with my foundation it is the most statement I use this like crazy it's honestly one of my favorite drugstore foundations it's just so easy to apply and i love that Lucy texture so I'm going to be applying this all over my face yeah yeah yeah

finish off my eye makeup i'm gonna go in with this urban decay eyeliner in the shade main line which is a really beautiful matte teal color and then i'm going to be taking the brush that comes with the electric palette and I'm gonna dip it into the shape gonzo and I am just going to smudge this on my lower lashline then I'm just going to blend it out with a pencil brush so it's not too harsh and

guys please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial using the brand new Urban Decay electric palette which looks like oh well I don't know that was totally unnecessary I know anyway this isn't a full-face makeup tutorial just because i didn't want the video to be so long since at the end of the video I'm going to be doing a quick review on this and join us watches and what I think of the palette so I didn't want to go into a full face of makeup and then do a review and have this video be like 30 minutes long I'm not rested today so yeah you want to see swatches and my thoughts about this pilot just stay tuned to the end of the video but if you want to see how to get this look then just keep on watching oh I'll show you like my lip combo to though yeah keep watchin so the first thing I'm going to do is take my little rock behind the scenes eye primer and this is what i'm going to use to prime my lids and then i'm taking a lot of it underneath my eyes because i am putting a lot of eye shadows underneath my eyes I'm just going to take my NYC sunny bronzer and i'm going to use a little crease brush and I'm going to add this to my lid just to add some color to my eyelid so I'm focusing that on my outer V and then bring it into my crease I'm just going to continue to do this until I have the intensity that I want and I'm also going to be taking it a little bit past the crease as well ok yeah now i'm going to take this color called chaos from the palette and only small little angled brush I'm going to be adding some fixed plus and then dipping into the eye shadow and then i'm going to be using this kind of like gel eyeliner and I'm going to be creating a pretty thick wing with this i recommend dipping your brush into the powder first and then adding fix plus because this is a matte eyeshadow and it can get a little bit chunky if you add water to it so i recommend adding the pics + after you dip it into the shadow yeah so before i continue on with the wing really quick i'm gonna add some eyeliner this is the Urban Decay eyeliner in the color chaos and i'm using this to tight line and i'm also going to be adding this to my waterline as well ok so going back in to the chaos color i'm adding a little bit more fixed plus  just intensify it a bit and I'm going to be adding a thick wing and i suck at recording this because i always get out of focus and it's just a big hot mess but just add your wing just like you were adding gel eyeliner yeah kinda just went back into my bronzer and i added some more into my crease just to intensify it a little bit to give myself a little bit more color for my highlight I'm using the elf baked eye liner in moonlight and pressure is called moonstone when I don't know i have it down below and i am using this in my inner corner and underneath my brow bone as well i'm going to take the brush that came with the palette and I'm going to be dipping it into the color chaos and running that underneath my lower lash line but staying on the outer half of my I kind of stopping where the pupil is and by the way I didn't add any fixed plus to this part then going into this shade right here called gonzo i'm going to be taking it on the same brush and then adding it in the center of my lower lash line and then bring all the way towards my inner tear duct just to kind of have it fade from the light blue to the cold ball blue yeah then I'm going to flip the brush around and with no additional product I'm just gonna be blending on these colors just to make it a little bit more seamless then with that same brush I'm going to be putting it back into the gonzo shade and adding some more just to smoke it out and make it look like really blown out underneath the lower lash line and then take this color here called revolt and i'm just going to add this - my little tear duct area just to give it some pizzazz add some glitter and some I don't know you know yeah I don't know just for fun again i'm going to be using two different mascara i am using the maybelline colossal volume Express and the Maybelline rocket volume Express are also going to be using the rocket on my lower lash line as well for my lips I'm going to take maxima gentle lip liner and i'm going to fill in my lips with this which is a really nice and vibrant pinky purple yeah for my lipstick i am using the wet and wild my class lipstick and don't blink pink yeah and for my lip gloss i'm using the revlon colorburst lip gloss and adorned and that is it for this tutorial i hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching ok guys so basically i think this palette is phenomenal like it's absolutely amazing first of all i'm just going to talk about the packaging for a second because the packaging is incredible like is it they did such a good job with this packaging it's like a bunch of colorful smoke all over the palate and it's great and it's dirty and it's i am a mistake by the way so excuse the voice but it's sturdy and it's so durable I feel like like I feel like it's pretty durable and it comes with a gigantic mirror like seriously this mirror is so big it's great they love it now talking about the actual product these things are so intense these aren't just your basic eye shadows by the way these are pressed pigment so they aren't just your basic regular eye shadows there are 10 times more pigmented because they are pressed pigments so you're definitely getting amazing color payoff with this palette every single eyeshadow has fantastic color payoff everything what the pilot also comes with a double ended brush and it is actually really cute it's black and the bristles are purple so cute i use this throughout the entire tutorial in this video and i love it like I think it's a great great brush I see myself reaching for a lot even packs on color onto your lid beautifully people have been freaking out because there's a disclaimer on the packaging or on the box that some of these pigments in this palette are not used for your immediate I area and it is these 4 i'm pretty sure it's slow burn Savage urban and tilted the reddish the pink and the purple they say it's not for your immediate area but honestly that's very typical for pigments I've heard that so many times when it comes to pigments so when i read that it did really bother me I guess people just didn't realize that that was the case for some pigments I had never read it on any packaging but i've heard people like a mac tell me that so I mean it's no big deal if you are a little bit afraid just don't put them on like your waterline or anything like that but honestly I don't think your eyes will get irritated from it everybody has different skin so it will take my word for it but I used it on my eyes and i've used the Pink's on my eyes before and I haven't had any irritation personally and mom about sensitive skin so I mean I've been doing I've been going pretty fine with these i'm going to quickly swatch all of the colors on my arm so you can see how great and pigmented these things are ok so this is the most Awkward swatching i have ever done what possessed me to put them on the side of my arm no idea let's just roll that these are the colors look like they're insanely pigmented being pressed pigment of course this one is revolt it is a very intense shiny silvery color it does have a little bit of glitter in it like chunks of glitter but if you want this eyeshadow it goes on like liquid metal seriously it's not what right now this is how it normally swatches and it's still like gorgeous love it this one is gonzo right here it's a beautiful blue this one here is called slow burn and it is my second favorite color in the palette absolutely love it it's beautiful this one is your typical hot hot pink and this one is called savage and this one is matt this one has a little bit of glitter in it but like barely noticeable it definitely comes out Matt on your eyelid this right here is called fringe and it is a metallic teal type of color and it is seriously stunning on the lid this one is your typical cobalt blue and it is called chaos this one right here is called jilted it's also one of my favorites because it has a good dual chrome effect it looks pink and it looks purple in certain angles it's amazing this one right here is a nice deep purple and it is called urban this one right here it is called freak and it is just like an intense minty sort of minty green color and then this one is my absolute favorite one of the entire palette and it is called thrash and it is just like an intense lime green it's not even picking up how intense this color is in person like oh my god my favorite favorite favorite favorite so I hope this awkward angle of swatching helped you in some way by the way i do recommend using these colors with a primer underneath even though they are so intensely pigmented definitely use a primer because if you don't it will stay in your eyes like you put the pink on trying to get off and you're like oh god they're still pink on my lid so definitely is a primary want to use a primer there is no staining at least I don't detect any staining also if you want I shadows to be super super intense i recommend using a white base and now we'll just make them look crazy so anyway I hope you enjoyed this tutorial thank you so much for watching hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here I wanted to do something blue because i was really inspired by this palette right here this is the morphe 35o d I know that everybody's using the 3500 palette right now which is calling my name because it's full of oranges and those are my favorite kinds of colors but i thought you know what I'm going to step out of my comfort zone I'm not going to do an orange smokey eye today I'm going to do a blue one so I just focused on me blue colors in this palette this is a very pigmented palette pretty freaking amazing i will link it down below if you're interested so yes I think it's really pretty sometimes blue scared me and sometimes I feel like I can't pull it off but decided to run with it and if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching ok so i've already primed my eyes with my Mac 24 hour extended I base and i did go into this palette as well not just the morphe palette this is the to face naturally matte palette because the morphe one lacks crease shade and stuff like that so i just applied that vanilla color on my entire lid - set the primer and now i'm going in with this one I believe it was called kashmir bunny on a fluffy brush and that's going to be my transition shade then I'm taking that really intense blue in the palette now this one does work a lot better with fix+ so I just sprayed some fixed plus on my brush this is an elf brush and I dipped it back into the eye shadow and then apply it like that onto my lid and so it can be really really really intense and frosty now i'm gonna take this matt navy blue and on this little pencil brush i'm just going to start applying this into my crease now this looks looks a little messy and sloppy before it looks good so you know just take your time with it I'm just putting this into my crease back and forth and trying to blend the shimmery blue with the matte blue then I'm going into this color called honey butter this is in the to face palette and on a fluffy crease brush I am just trying to blend out the harsh lines and then I'm going to do the same thing with chocolate crap just trying to blend everything into the crease this look requires a lot a lot of blending and I'm gonna go back into that blue i'm not going to spray fix+ but i'm just going to intensify the little bit more since you blend so much a lot of it does get blended away now i'm going into this other shimmery maybe blue the other one was like a mad navy blue this one's a shimmery one and i'm doing the same thing I did with the navy blue just make sure everything is nice and blended all the crease colors fade into each other back again with cashmere bunny and I am just further blending possible ending little living I'm gonna take this coastal scents brush and this matte black in the palette and I'm going to start packing this on the outer corners I want the drama to be like on the outer corner of the lid i wanted to go from like black to blue I'm just packing on that black and I guess I forgot I was filming tutorial but i just put that middle shade under my brow bone the same one I used on my lid ok so moving onto my face before I finish my eyes I am priming my face with the rebecca black light filter primarily this was called I'm obsessed with this I think it's amazing then I went in with the Loreal infallible Pro matte foundation in shell beige I will in this the number i have and i'm using this with a real techniques complexion sponge and I am just bouncing that on my whole face I love this foundation but i do need to use a very illuminating primer and a sponge with it because if not it looks too dry and cakey then underneath my eyes I decided to use my NARS creamy rating concealer i haven't used it in a hot minute so I'm using vanilla underneath my eyes and I'm also highlighting with this and I'm just blending everything out with the same real techniques sponge now i'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent setting powder and i'm just going to set my under eye concealer so moving onto my face again I mean my eyes this is max nylon eyeshadow it's a really intense color so i use that in my inner corners then I'm going to take this tart tart 'used gel liner cream liner thing and this is a little sigma brush and I'm taking this liner all the way into my inner corners like my inner tear duct as you can see and I'm dragging that on my waterline so not only am i doing a wing with this but I'm going to put it in my inner corners like a cat I Egyptian kind of effect and on my waterline and then I'm just going to do a little flick and this is the Too Faced better than sex mascara and for my bottom lashes I wanted a blue color I thought it would look really cool so this is the they're real mascara by benefit in their blue shade and its really really cool i like how it turned out I think it's different I didn't put any eyeshadow on my lower lashes just for a little bit of a change and then I put on some falsies those were the morphe demi wispies so to contour me to do a soft contour with my girl lactic Kabul bronzer this is a morph e.g something brush from the gun metal collection it's their powder brush and I'm just using this brush because it does apply a soft amount like a light amount of product so I'm just contouring and bronzing with that for my highlight i am using color pops wisp highlight it's beautiful and I love applying this with a sponge i can apply it with a synthetic brush too but i really like how the sponge applies it i'm also highlighting my nose you know ok so for blush I'm using the clinique nude pop blush pop for my lips I'm taking color pops lip liner in BFF and i'm just going to line my entire lips with this like all over the place all over my lips and then I'm just going to top it off with the NARS lip gloss in the shade Chelsea girls 10 girls and then that completes this look I really hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look right here I love these kind of looks where it's like gray eyes and great lips I know that's like a very big trend I wanted to do a makeup tutorial surrounding the Anasazi liquid lipstick in sepia it looks so much darker on me that it doesn't everyone else I feel but it's okay i like it and i used mostly the Kat Von D shade and light palette I really love these type of looks where you match like eyes and lips together especially these gray tones and it's kind of weird for me to do this because i don't have mascara on my lower lash line I always smoked out my lower lashes and put on mascara and I didn't do that for today's video i wanted to switch it up and I don't know I don't know anyway if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching so the first thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids as usual this is Mac's painterly Paint Pot and I'm bluffing that out with a zoe book concealer brush now i'm going to go into the Kat Von D shade and light palette and I'm taking this whitish kind of color i don't have the palate with me because it's in storage at the moment but i'm just going to walk you through the colors this is like a whiter shade and I just set that bass down this is a Luxy crease brush and I'm applying that really really really light bone beige like grayish color and i'm applying this into my crease as my transition shade now i'm taking max copper plates eyeshadow it's just a neutral gray and this is a morphe brush and i'm just applying this on the outer corners of my really close to that tape and slightly bringing it in like slowly bringing in it I'm going to take this dark great in the palette with that same brush and I'm just going to do the exact same thing I'm just taking a bunch of great tone eyeshadow and creating like a gradient effect from the tape going to my inner corners so that's what I'm doing again same thing you know packing it on the outer corners and bringing it in slowly now i'm going into the black of the palette and on a different more dense precise brush I am packing this really really really close to the tape I want the black to just be focused on the very outer like corners like the cat eye shape that effect so I'm packing that black really close to the tape as adjusted then I'm going to take that same color use first and i'm just applying this to my in your corners so that it could just look a little bit brighter on my lid and then i'm applying that to my brow bone and in my tear duct as well just to highlight those parts in my eyes I have a cold by the way if you can tell i use that nyx eyeliner or use it like every tutorial it's my favorite from the drugstore and I tight line and what and added that to my waterline and then I just use my makeup forever graphic liner to create a very very small wing to prime my face i use the backup backlight primer and then for foundation i am using the urban decay naked skin foundation and i'm using it on a cover effects custom foundation brush so I'm just popping in this brush is really really cool it's so incredibly dense so it gives you really good coverage like it doesn't drink up barely any of the foundation it's pretty cool i really get so I'm just noting that in too much so I'm adding concealer underneath my eyes now and this is the Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser and then in the shade fair i believe and i'm just applying that underneath my eyes and then blending that in but you've seen me blend this about a million times so let's just skip over them to set my concealer i'm using the laura mercier translucent setting powder and this is a real techniques setting brush and then I just plopped on some mascara i left my lower lashes bear that might seem really weird for some people but I thought it was cool and different so I applied my Too Faced better than sex mascara and now i'm going to contour very very slightly and very naturally with the a cosmetics contour kit and I use that shade in the middle and I'm just slightly contouring with this I don't want anything too heavy for blush I'm using one of my favorite blushes during this time like this time of year and it's tart expose the blush and i'm using this on a blush brush from morphe from their gun metal collection now to highlight I'm using the overflow shimmering strips in the shade illuminating and i'm using that very very top strip to highlight my face out my phone , texas to highlight my face and I'm using this on an M 501 brush my morphe and then to finish off my look i'm using the Anasazi liquid lipstick in sepia that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so

and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the makeup i'm wearing right now it is a very warm look and i know that i do warm looks all the time on my channel they're my favorite looks to do especially in the summertime i love really warm bronzy looks but this look is a little bit different because I paired it with a bold lip and usually i pair my smoky eyes with nude lips you can definitely do this look and then pair it with a nude lip if you're more comfortable with that I know this is a little bit loud for some people wanted to do something different in terms of my lips usually my tutorials always end up with no lips so I wanted to change it up the slip i think it's so summery because it's a red neon lit but it has a little bit of orange undertone and it's so pretty i love it for those of you who are sick of all my warm tutorials don't worry i'm planning on doing a lot of tutorials with the lorac Pro palette 2 a little bit more cool toned looks though yeah i really hope you guys like this look and if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to prime my eyelids i am using my LA girl Pro conceal primer no concealer no primer i'm using this to prime my eyes because it is a full coverage product and it's just going to cover up all the redness and beans on my lids now I'm going to take my makeup eyeshadow in the shape peach smoothie and on a more feed fluffy brush I'm just going above this into my crease and just pretty much put it everywhere because it's gonna be my transition chain and it's going to give it a beautiful peach look now I'm going to take makeup geeks creme brulee and on a smaller blending brush I'm going to be doing the exact same thing only I'm not going to be too messy was it i'm going to be a little bit more precise and adding this directly in my crease and on the outer half of my eye yeah now i'm just going to take a warm orange shade this is just an orange eyeshadow in my naturally pretty palette from it cosmetics and on my mac 217 i'm going to be very very precise with this color a little bit more precise and creme brulee and i'm going to be putting this pretty much just like the hollow of my crease and on the outer be of my eye as well next I'm going to take my tart Park Avenue princess bronzer this and stab myself in the eye this is the shimmery one and i'm just going to pack this on my entire lid honestly any shimmery bronzer will do you can even skip this step I just wanted to add a little bit more dimension to the center of the lid since most of the colors are in the crease and the outer V of the eye but you don't have to do this step now I'm going to take mocha by makeup geek and it's a beautiful dark brown color I love this eyeshadow and on a flat shader brush i'm just going to be applying this really really close to my top lashes to kind of make like a very subtle eyeliner look I wanted to look deeper and like chocolate here towards the eyelashes and make it blown out towards the crease if that makes any sense really quickly I'm going to move on to the rest of my face before I finish my eyes I'm going to use my tart primed and poreless primer and I'm gonna put this all over my face well on the areas where I want to cover up my pores or to hide them or global or whatever now i'm using my revlon colorstay foundation into 5240 fresh i don't i don't exactly remember i will put it in the description box and this foundation is darker than my face but it matches the rest of my body so I am self tanning at the moment so that's why my faces a little bit wider than the rest of my body I'm going to use my boo cover up concealer and i'm going to use this to cover up my dark circles and to highlight my face as well I'm just blending that out with my Real Techniques contour brush yeah now i'm going to use macs emphasize powder and on my ELF tapered brush I'm just gonna pack that underneath my lashes to set my concealer underneath my lashes no no underneath my eyes to set my under eye concealer and set the rest of my concealer as well moving back to the eyes i'm just going to take mocha again into the exact same thing i did earlier only making it a little bit darker this time and then i'm going to sweep my brush back and forth just to blend it out and it can look kind of like a sunset there goes darker to lighter now i'm going to be using my milani shadow eyes and I'm gonna use this to run it on the waterline and then i'm going to go in with Max no makeup geeks is wrong created a makeup geeks creme brulee and i'm just going to apply this underneath my lashes and really really blow it out i'm going to smoke it out i wanted to look very very smoky on the lower lash line and I'm gonna take mocha again and i'm going to set that cream product i put in my waterline now I have been putting a shadow in my waterline for years and years and years and years and it's never irritated by I don't have sensitive eyes but if you have sensitive eyes and don't do this but I'm just gonna set that so it kind of makes like a nice brown eyeliner and the powder is just going to make it set and stay all day now i'm going to go in with this milani eyeshadow in the shade fellowship on and i'm going to apply this underneath my brow bone it is the most beautiful color has a gold undertone and I'm going to put this in my inner tear duct as well i'm applying some mascara to my bottom lashes and i'm getting them really really good because I want them to be very very like voluminous on my bottom lashes and i am using my Elizabeth mock it's so big mascara and then i'm going to apply some to the top lashes as well because i will be going in with some falsies i'm using my red cherry 747 ends and then i am going to apply them to my lashes so finishing off with my face i'm using my NARS Laguna bronzer on my ELF complexion brush and I'm just gonna be warming up my face I'm not adding blush so I want my face to be very very warm and bronzy but I'm really focusing this bronzer on my cheekbones I want it to be like very intense on my cheeks and you can see not like very intense but I want them to stand out my cheekbones so i'm applying a lot of the bronzer there now i'm gonna add my highlight and i'm using my Sigma contours to add it and I'm taking my fellowship on eyeshadow again and I'm going to use this as a base highlight this is so amazing to highlight your cheekbones because of that gold undertone almost goddess is so beautiful and the goddess like in summary i love it so much like my new favorite highlighter now it's so beautiful so that is what i'm doing and i'm going to take it on the bridge of my nose and on my upper lip and you know all the beautiful closest so for my lips the coolest part of this tutorial i am taking my milani anti feathering the pencil thing and I'm gonna put that on my lips and then I'm going to add some concealer to my lips so that the lip color will look more true to its color because my lips are very pigmented so the color that's on my lips is the lime crime Velveteen and suede very this stuff is no joke it's a beautiful hot neon orange II read it comes off more neon in person like a lot more neon and person it's just absolutely beautiful and it lasts all day on the lips i seriously had to get like makeup remover to take this off my lips because like cement on your face it's great if you want something that will last all day so that is the finished look guys I really hope you enjoyed this video thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you next time hey guys so today's video is going to be a prompt tutorial and i know that a couple of you guys have already had your prom and I'm so sorry I'm super late but I know some of you haven't had your prompt so better late than never hopefully so yeah let's get started I'm going to be using my Too Faced shadow insurance to prime my eyes this one keeps my action on for a really long time so it's pretty crucial for prom i'm going to add a face so that my eyeshadows can stand out a little bit more and i'm using the Milani shadow I in golden bronze I'm going to go into this eyeshadow from Mac called naked lunch and a flat shader brush I'm going to apply this to my entire lid I'm a little sick guys a number of the recipe I'm going to take some tape and apply that to the side of my eye to create a nice cat eye effect and then i'm going to go into max soft brown and i'm going to love this into my crease and just working that color back and forth yeah yeah I'm going to go into the shape called copper plate this is also from mac and i'm going to be doing the exact same thing I actually like how these two colors look together there's something about the cool tone and deform tones that I think look really nicely paired together then taking a dark chocolatey shade this is brown down from Mac I'm just going to build this color slowly onto my outer be and just drag it into my crease and a little bit on my lid as well this I look does take a lot of blending so you just want to go back and forth with the eyeshadow just apply a little by little and not get too heavy handed with it yeah then I'm going to take this pigment from makeup geek it is called a stir well and it's absolutely amazing and a flat shader brush I'm going to apply this on to the center of my lid dragging it towards my inner tear duct I'm just going to take any matte black eyeshadow and i'm going to be doing the exact same thing I did with the chocolate brown color only focusing the black a little bit more towards the tape and not so much on my entire is that makes any sense just dragging that a little bit into my crease but focusing most of the black color right at the tape so that it does have a nice transition I'm gonna take this gel eyeliner from Maybelline this one lasts a really long time on my island that's why it would be perfect for prom and then I'm just going to add a thin line I don't want anything too thick so that it doesn't overpower my entire I and don't worry about a perfect little wing because the tape does act as a perfect little guide so that you don't mess up then I'm just going to go back into the black eyeshadow and just intensify the black a little bit more packing most of the black like I said towards the tape and I'm just going to take the tape off and then I'm going to go into max shroom and i'm going to use this as my inner corner highlight yeah underneath my brow bone i am just taking a random white matte eyeshadow and applying this underneath my brow bone i'm going to be doing my eyebrows next and I like priming my eyebrows with eyeshadow primer when I want them to last all day which is what you would want for prom I have an entire eyebrow tutorial that i will link down below if you're interested is this would take way too much time I'm gonna move on to the rest of my face and Prime with my Maybelline Baby skin applying it on the places where I think I needed the most I'm going to take a photo friendly foundation mine is the urban decay naked skin this has no SPF so it looks amazing in pictures which is ideal for prom and i'm just going to buff this all over my face using a Real Techniques buffing brush yeah next I'm going to conceal my under eyes and I recommend using a full coverage long-lasting can see their mind would be the mac pro longwear it last literally all day and it is full coverage but when I want to go film this tutorial it was nowhere to be found so I'm just using the Maybelline fit me concealer just for the sake of this video but i definitely recommend one that will last all night long and it is pretty good coverage and my program where is perfect for that but this will do for the sake of this video and I'm just buffing that out with the Real Techniques contour brush yeah i'm going to set everything on my face using my Mac msf natural and shade medium I love this powder because it is very finely milled and it does not look cakey on the skin whatsoever so you're not going to look like you have a lot of powder on your face and to set my under eye can see there i'm using this powder called emphasize is also for mac I'm sorry and I'm using like a lot of mac in this video I don't know I didn't even realize it while I was filming but i'm just going to set my under eye concealer with this powder then to finish off my eyes I'm going to take a q-tip and run that on my waterline just take out any of the excess oils and the pencil that i'm using right here will last a lot longer i'm using my chela I release highlighter this is just going to open up the eyes your eyes don't look

a makeup tutorial on the look I'm wearing now this is the exact same look I was wearing in my sep tember favorites video and so many of you guys asked me to film a tutorial on this look so that's what I did it is a talk through tutorial because i haven't done one of those recently and i am using the team has great pilot by dubious place i know i've been using it so much but since this was in my September favorites i did this look using it and it was requested so that's what I'm doing it and then I realized like every time I wear a look like this i get so many compliments on how green my eyes look anytime I wear red tone eyeshadows are very warm eyeshadows I get complimented on how green my eyes look so i thought this look would be perfect for those of you with green eyes I mean if you have any I color you could totally do this look but this is a great way for those of you with green eyes to really make your eyes stand out and it's so so easy this look is perfect for the holidays even though we're only in october-december will be here in the blink of an eye and this look is perfect for thanksgiving for Christmas for anything so yes anyway if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching ok so I've already applied my foundation and concealer and my powder just because i feel like i do that in every single look and I don't want it to be too repetitive or too boring but i'm wearing the Urban Decay all nighter foundation and whatever i'm wearing will be listed below so i'm going to put my hair back i recently purchased this you guys know I like to wear these little headbands when I film tutorials this is the one that I always wear i have put it away for the spring and summer and I was wearing like the flower pink one but I'm bringing this bad boy back out and i love it i have purchased this one with this one hurts my head like I mean I have a big head and this is like so tight I don't know I guess I were a few times and maybe my big ol handle stretch it out but you guys don't care i know i'm just i'm just don't know I'm chatty today ok so I'm just gonna go ahead and get started I am busting out the mastery palette by Julius place and all I did in my sep tember favorites video was just take all the matte shades and i just threw them on my eyes so on a fluffy crease brush this is the NARS crease brush it says number 42 at the bottom i'm going to take the shade burkina right here and I'm going to focus this on my lid I'm not really gonna bring it up to the crease oh wait let me zoom in even though i am using a crease brush I really don't want it to get too far up on my lid i'm just using a crease brush to really blend and buff everything else focusing it really really close to my lashes and then dragging it up and buffing it out i use my concealer to prime my eyelids and then I start to slowly drag some of that into the crease it's going to look a little bit messy but that is the look we're going for it's a very messy smoky daytime look I mean you could totally wear this in the nighttime as well this is definitely not something that's just for the daytime now i'm going to go in with a clean blending brush this is the morphe 23 i'm going to buff out those edges i do not want too much pigmentation here in the crease now i'm going to take the shade zoo right here which is a very very warm almost red-brown i'm going to take the morphe thirteen brush I know that these are discontinued but i know so many of you guys have them already and I'm pretty much just applying this color really really close to the lashes and doing the same thing just dragging it up a little bit but I'm not going to take it as far as I took the shade burkina now on an even smaller little fluffy brush this is the Real Techniques shading brush I'm going to take this shay right here called ADA or add up it's very similar to the shade we just used but this one is a little bit more red and I'm going to do the exact same thing focusing this one even closer to my lashline and then the other shade so we're pretty much doing like a gradient you want your shades to fade from like darkest to lightest then I'm gonna go back in with that fluffy brush we first use and go back into that first shade we used and I'm just gonna blend on top of it and I know it's a little bit repetitive but we're going to do the exact same thing all over again i'm going to apply the shade Zulu once more on my lid there is a little bit of fallout with this palette as well as you can see there's kind of like some brown eyeshadow underneath which is why I always always do my eyeshadow first sometimes I'll do my face makeup first like today but i always recommend doing eyeshadow first and then i'm going to go back into the shada with the same brush and do the same thing for some reason a lot of people always tell me like why is your eye makeup before your face you're not supposed to do that you're supposed to do your face makeup first and I don't get why people get so upset about it like where is the handbook tell me where its sense that I have to do my face makeup first please tell me it's just personal preference doesn't mean you're doing it right or doing it out of order do your makeup the way you want to if you want to draw on one eyebrows and do your whole face and then draw this one who says you can I like to put on my makeup first because i like to avoid the fallout on my own foundation ok so i am going to go back in with a few more eyeshadows in a second but I want to work on my lower lashline i'm going to use the exact same shade i already use on my top lid gonna take burkina first I have no idea if I'm pronouncing that work correctly doesn't sound like i am i'm going to apply it using this urban decay brush number eat 08 then I'm going to take the shade Zulu followed by a little bit of ADA i'm going to use the Luxy 217 brush to smudge both of these out dippin into a dup data and getting really really really close with this shade I love looks like this because they really take no skill and even though they look a little crazy weird now with eyeliner or a ton of mascara it just looks like edgy and smoky and it was like the easiest i would ever now i'm going to take the colour-pop crumb gel liner in the shade mr. Bing i love this eyeliner it just intensifies any brown smokey eye and I just love how it makes green eyes look even brown eyes I feel like mr. being emphasizes like the golden tones in your eyes if you have brown eyes awesome for blue eyes as well gonna play a little so the look in my September favorites video wasn't as red as it is now I did apply some more brown colors so I took the shape fulani say that rambla not fulani for LAN Jie and on this same Real Techniques brush I'm going to apply that really really close I'm also going to put that on my little girl Ashley then I thought okay I want to even a little bit less red because i really wanted to match my lip color but I don't want to clash so on this little brush this is the wave of 237 brush i took this eyeshadow this is the make up for ever and 618 but any dark brown eyeshadow you have in your collection i know you have one that will work taking a bit of this and smudging that super close to the lashes like super-close because this I shot up his and dent now i'm going to take this shade right here called Giza and on this milani crease brush I'm going to put that on my inner corners for my brow bone highlight because the masquerade pilot doesn't really have a very very light satin color I'm going to take my essence pure nude highlight which I'm gonna end up using on my face and I'm taking the morphe am 210 brush and I'm going to use this to highlight my browbone i'm giving my eyelashes a really good curl because i am not applying eyeliner or false lashes so I really want my mascara to stand out this is the tweezerman eyelash curlers and now i'm going to apply a lot of this this is the superhero mascara by it cosmetics very volumizing very black i'm going to apply a ton of this company that is it can get a little bit clumpy if you use too much what I like to do when my eyelashes start to stick together is I'll take this i love this is like my little trustee guy this is the morphe beat 71 and I'll just comb through my eyelashes and it really does a good job of getting rid of those clubs so I'm just going to apply mascara to the rest of my lashes and i will be right back to finish my face ok so now we're completely done with the eyes so so so so easy now I'm going to contour my face a little bit i know in my favorites video i was wearing the coming of Quan sculpting powder in light but since they just use that like in my last tutorial I didn't want to use it again so I'm gonna take me physicians formula of butter bronzer which now i totes realize i also use this in my last tutorial this is the butter runs are in the shade bronzer I'm gonna take my milani blush brush I love saying that blush blush brush and to use this to contour my faced ken physicians formula release a butter bronzer that smells like fall that'd be awesome because right now this is taking me to Hawaii are you guys watching how to get away with murder I'm not gonna give any spoilers I hope I don't lose interest in it the way that I lost interest in scandal I know no company but i did lose interest in scandal just because I was like going back and forth like who does she love hood and it just it was driving me nuts so i'm going to take the wet and wild color icon bronzer in ticket to Brazil it's a very warm shimmery bronzer and i'm just going to use this to warm up the skin a little bit i was also wearing this in my favorites video using these wava 90 brush it's like they're baked powder brush puffed-up helped up ok so for blush I'm going to use the bombs blush in the shade Palm Beach this is a very long wearing blush and i agree this this like last a long time on my skin taking my makeup forever 122 brush it's just a stippling brush I like stippling brushes for blush like any stippling brush because i feel like it applies blush a little bit more naturally you don't have to make up for everyone this is like overpriced elf has a really really nice stippling brush that I love morphy Sigma ok so now i'm going to highlight my face using the highlight I use underneath my brow bone the essence . highlighter this stuff is so affordable and so good it looks so natural on the skin just going to apply some of that to the tops of my cheekbones using these away ba11 for brush and then before i sat down to fill my favorites video i popped on a little bit of this guy right here this is my makeup geek kathleenlights highlighter palette oh i have been using this in my videos because I don't want to like shove it down your throat I don't like doing that too much but I took a little bit of night light and I put that right at the top right here like only right there booth and then i'm also going to take some of that put it in my inner corners because I want my inner corners to look a little bit more golden so yeah this point you can throw on a nude lip and I think it would look amazing but since this is the lip color i was wearing my favorite video i'm gonna pop this on and honestly I always tell people who have green eyes to try to embrace red lipstick because i think that green eyes match really well with lipstick the red really just pulls out the green even when I wear like red clothing people compliment how green my eyes look at know but I'm gonna go in with the kat von d everlasting liquid lipstick in the shade project chimps this was limited edition but a few of you guys told me it's still available on the kat von d website and if you do purchase this i think all proceeds or a portion of the proceeds go to help the chimps i'm just going to apply this to my mouth ok so i just applied to four layers of this it is a little bit streaky not streaky it's a little bit thin of a formula so if you do just 14 layer it won't be streaky but it'll be a lighter red I wanted it to be a little bit darker like this so i did two layers so yes that completes this makeup look I think it's so pretty for green eyes or for any eye color you have whatever your eye color is I like this look regardless but if you do have green eyes and you've been searching for a way to make them stand out in your makeup i think this is a good way to go yes secondly this video and i hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye so today's video is a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right now I cut myself cleaning my food processor this morning so this is the look that I've been wearing a lot recently just not on my videos because as you guys know I've been pre-recording a lot but I've worn this look three times in the past week and that's saying a lot because I like to like we're different things but honestly I think this look is perfect for fall if you are a simple gal I think we like to wear like a lot less makeup in the summer and we really to glam it up in the fall time so I did a little bit more than i would normally do as an everyday look during the summer this is a lot of makeup for some people for an everyday look but I think it's perfect for fall because it's just like a little bit vampy been natural at the same time i don't know i really like it and it's something that you can wear all the time and just switch up the lip color you could do a dark red or brown mmm i would have had way too much coffee today and I'm like and you can tell ok so if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching ok so i'm taking my hair out of my face in my little headband here i'm going to take the Smashbox BB water i'm in the shade light you have to shake it up first and then i'm applying this to my face this is a Sephora Pro air brush brush I'm not even sure the name but it was in that limited edition packaging with the flowers i'm just applying that to my entire face I skipped primer when i use that because I find that I don't really need to this is the Maybelline what is this called the better skin concealer there you go I applied that underneath my eyes to highlight and to cover up my circles and then i apply that to the rest of my face as I normally do this is the sedona lace 17 brush my holy grail concealer brush and I'm just blending all of that in this is the it cosmetics bye bye pores powder the press version i love this so I'm just taking the real techniques setting brush and I'm setting my under eye concealer yeah now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm using the Maybelline 24 hour cream eyeshadow in the shade creamy beige this came out with like their letters collection but i still see it all the time and i'm just applying that to my entire lid i just wanted a hint of color but not something that was really noticeable I like doing this for like an everyday look and then i'm applying some of that underneath my lower lashes with this fluffy brush for mascara I'm using this one by clinic it's like their chubby fat mascara but this is a red shade like a red color and I think it's so cool like so nice for a fall because it's a deep primary shade and you can tell it just gives like a slight hint you can't unless you look really close but I think it's cool so now to finish up my face that's all I do with the eyes I'm using the elf mineral bronzer and i'm going to use this to contour I don't exactly remember the name of this brush but it's like a morphy blush brush now i'm going to apply some blush this is like a bronzer and blush in one this is benefits Dallas box powder blush thing it's like a really pretty mob color it's so nice this time of year I always busted out in the fall time it's beautiful so for highlight I'm using Becca's champagne pop and I'm just barely putting this on the tops of my cheekbones I don't want to look too glowy but just a little bit of something something and now i'm moving on to my lips and this is the star of the show you can change up your lip color for an everyday because this I look goes with everything but this is color pops Libby stick in the shade grunge and then that completes make a book i really hope you guys enjoyed please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is going to be a top through tutorial kind of excited to do one because i haven't done one in a while I haven't actually done a tutorial in a while because you guys know and then painting and I've actually had to film videos that were super easy to film like just reviews or talking kind of videos um let's talk about something really good so I got new lights and actually like my lighting is completely off in this video I don't know if you guys could tell it looks bad in the viewfinder and probably looks bad to you guys highlighting is completely off because i had told you guys in a previous video that i had a ring light and then I broke it so i thought that the only thing that broke with the bowl because the bulb shattered into a million pieces so i purchased a new bowl so I want to go put the bulb inside the ring light and it was there and it was perfect on like a beautiful and i want to plug it in and it didn't work so it wasn't the bulb something was coming is completely wrong with my ring light actually called the people i told the situation and I was still under warranty so i have to send it out tomorrow they have to have to get it they have to see what's wrong with it and if there's something wrong that they can't fix they will send me a new one so that's probably going to take like two weeks that's really like a two-week process to be honest so i'll probably be filming my videos at nighttime because it's night time right now which is what I mean it was probably feeling my videos facing the mirror like I always do until i get my ring light in the mail because like the lighting is really bad right now but anyway today's video is going to be a tutorial talk to do and i think i'm just going to do like a combination of looks I've been wearing in my previous videos I'm going to do the I look I'm going to use my too faced natural matte palette this is what it looks like a little bit it's kind of like the look I was wearing in the review only without the blue and black to add the blue i'm just going to use this palette and this pellet alone so I actually going to start out with my face I never start out of my face but why not much i'm gonna figure out here by the way there's still an echo in this room like a hardcore echo and I don't know what else to do i open the window i put a rug I put my friends are in here maybe two blenders on the other side of the room anyway so I don't exactly know what to do I'm still going to get more furniture i have to put in like another furniture unit in this room it's because i have hardwood floors in here outside i open up a window to see if that would help but I don't know if i should get a bigger rug like a more fluffy rug or just put like a bunch more things on the wall I don't know i have a mic so i bought a mic for the echo in my last room and seemed to work but for some reason in this room is just ok so I'm going to find my face using my favorite primer in the entire world this is the hangover or xor hangover x4 planishing face primer i love this because it has coconut water electrolytes probiotics I really like it because it hydrates my face most importantly so it's kind of like a primer and moisturize our all-in-one and I really really love it all the girls like my band-aid I was actually setting up the lights a little while ago and I got it clamped my arm and I was like bleeding and it was traumatic I'm gonna add some radiance to my face because the foundation I'm using I kind of really have to be doing for it to look good but i still really love it so i'm going to use it and i'm using the body shop radiant hi later i got this at the body shop store in california and i really like it's just like a champagne me pink color it's really pretty on top of the cheekbones but actually really like it underneath my makeup as well ok so the foundation I'm using is the brand new foundation to cover effects like they just came out with this and this was sent to me actually have an efficient if I can call Corey a friend hi Cory if you're watching but i have a friend sort of who works over at cover of X and sometimes sends me like new products and i love this foundation i tried out for the first time yesterday and i really like it and usually I do not like foundations like this because it's like a serum eat kind of foundation kinda like the Bearskin one from bareMinerals hated it the physicians formula once in a dropper hated it I don't like Sierra me things they don't stick wall on my dry skin but this one if I hydrate actually love the finish I have mine g30 it's their cover effects custom cover drops I love eat just comes out like a dropper like this I just dropped them on the back of my hand Oh too much has too much super runny you can see you have to shake it really good before you apply it says shake law and i like to use my beauty blender with it that's a little scary lip and all comes together I really like to finish that this gives it doesn't feel like a matte finish but it looks kind of like flawless I don't know how to explain it it is a little light for me as you can see it a little pill but nothing a little bronzer Catholics ok moving on I'm going to take my pixie correction concentrate and brightening the peach writing peach it's just like an under-eye corrector I'm gonna place it underneath my eyes here I've actually been using an eye cream that has really been working it's a new eye cream and i love it and i feel like my eyes are as dark as they usually are and I've got a feeling inside cream so I'm not going to add like a concealer I'm just gonna focus on highlighting i'm using my dream lumi touch highlighting concealer I'm just going to draw it and that's like upside down triangle thing just to highlight my face if you hear crickets my windows open I'm going to use my same beauty blender to blend of him I didn't do it just a little bit what the hell I'm gonna set my under eyes with my way but uh 1 14 bucks face focus and I'm going to use my HD under eyes setting powder I'm trying to see how this one compares to the laura mercier secret brightening powder so it's called yet because i really love that one thing i don't like is this these little glitters like what you really can't see them all that much ok so I'm going to do my eyes i'm going to apply them using my mac paint pot as per usual days in my eyes like ninety percent of the time no matter what because i find that it really really prolongs the world my eye makeup and hide all the veins on my lids like all the darkness and all the creepy stuff because it is like a skin tone color or at least the color close to my skin tone and I just I really really love it cannot say enough about this i'm going to take the two faced natural met out Alan talent I'm going to take right here this color called heaven and on the brush like this this is just a Zoe but 25 I'm just going to pack this on my entire lid kind of set that cream base we put down because if I go in with another eye shadow right now and make Reese it's just going to get stuck to the base so this is just going to help put a nice like shadow layer next I'm going to take this fluffy blending brush by NARS I have no idea what it's called 2 I'm going to take the color called new tea and i'm just going to apply this in my crease this is basically just going to act as my transition shade from the colors i will be using so they could blend easier do I look blue feel like this is lights make me look good I'm going to take this color called honey butter it's a really pretty warm peanut butter shade and i'm going to apply this to my entire lid this is just going to be like an all over the lid color for me also got a diff my fluffy blush brush into that color again and added to my crease as well ok nevermind me to channel his palate I'm going to take chocolate cookie and i'm going to play this on the outer portions of my eye and into my crease as well this is a deli am tools brush 77 I'm going to take this small crease brush from making feet I call it a pencil brush this one looks like and I'm a different honey water and kind of do the same thing on the lower lash line i'm going to mimic the top then taking chocolate cookie and putting it on the outer parts of my life not going to take 6x6 presso and add that to the lower lash line just to take away some of the warmth so it doesn't look like I have like a red eye I look crazy just wait and then I'm going to take it again and do that to the top part it's going to give it a little bit more deepness and dimension here just a little bit i'm gonna have some eyeliner to mai tais line and my waterline and i'm going to use the NYX jumbo pencil liner in brown obviously i love it these are amazing and my new favorite went to the drugstore they're so good I really feel like I don't have to tug at my waterline when i use this because it just glides on that I don't need to pull my eye i'm going to highlight like my inner corners and my problem with my face highlight since everything in here is Matt and I want like more of a similar thing someone who want to mascara I'm going to curl my lashes my show more eyelash curler so now i'm going to prime my life is this is the estee lauder little black primary eyelash primer yeah I really love this because it does a great job of keeping my eye lashes curled throughout the day and they make managed super black and I really i just love I just love any mascara that go on top of it makes it that much better then I'm going with jordanna's best / extreme round cool this lightning is making me look so pale I'm gonna cry I just want to have to put on mascara on like on the rest of my eyes this lighting is making me look really ghostly like it's driving minutes remember it's the first time using my life bear with me i'm going to go ahead and bronze up my face i'm going to use the body shops bronzing powder in light matte 01 looks like this is like a honey honey comb and i'm using my lem tools nine seven four I love this bronzer I feel like it's quickly becoming one of my top fav bronzers ever because it's that happy medium it's really light when you look at it in the pan and it's pretty late when you apply it to your face but you can really build it up I mean it takes some time to build it up but it builds up really pretty and it's not packed you at all and it's that perfect undertone it's not to read it's not too orange it's not too pink or cool toned or money looking at like i'm going to apply my blush with the same brush these are the new NYX HD blushes and I really really like them especially this one this is in the shade soft-spoken and it's such a pretty color for spring if you're into PT blushes pick this one up its really nice yeah but because everything is so mad on my face I want to add like a lot more of glow i'm going to use this product this is pretty new to me about a couple months ago this is the 24 micro smooth bank sculpting trio in lou manizer and I've never really give any of the stuff for brand products a glass at all but Olivia my friend that works at sephora was like I really like these i use them all the time and they're really good so i picked up this one along with two other ones i was so impressed by it it's not that expensive so for words like a much cheaper brand like the Sephora collection and this gives such a pretty glow to the cheek Spencer subtle glow like a very wearable everyday natural glow and just like to swirl my entire brush into this like so were lit up and just dust it takes my highlight my brow bone with this as well now i'm just going to finish off with my lips and this is the lip gloss i have been using non stop i wore it like previous videos when I was wearing a glossy lip this is the read my lips lip gloss from the bomb in the color Bam and I usually just apply this but so you know I'm gonna play Red Sox you can see it's such a pretty pigmented color i've been wearing it not ok so that completes the look i really hope you like it it's a very wearable everyday kind of look in my opinion sorry about the lighting completely sucks in this video I'm still tweaking it this was like a trial run once i get my ring light and I think it will look a lot better but i have to position them differently it's tough to work on it so excuse that might be like a you know a couple times before i get it right but this is the look I've been using or I'm wearing a lot with this palette i hope you guys get it when it's available it's a halt all right now but I think it's well worth the money I hope you guys get it you guys so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys i decided to do a makeup tutorial today on the eye makeup i'm wearing right now it is a green smokey eye but they're all of tones like they have some golden them because I never wear green eyeshadow i just don't think green eye shadow looks good on me I feel like it clashes with my eye color i don't know but i didn't want to do a green and gold e kind of I look for those of you who do like to wear green eyeshadow so this is the look i came up with i am using two different palettes in this tutorial but you can use colors that you have at home colours are similar to the ones i'm using and the colors I'm using our from the natural and night palette from to face and the Naked palette from urban decay i know a lot of people have this but i'm just using the greens that are in this palette actually like how it turned out not necessarily on me but I think this would look so beautiful if you have brown eyes so definitely try it out i do show you the rest of my face like my foundation my consider and all that stuff because i haven't been showing that in the last couple videos my just keep it very fresh and natural on the rest of my face kind of look I was going for so yeah if you want to see how to get this look then just keep watching ok so like always i'm going to start by priming my eyes and I'm using Mac's painterly clean hot to do this now i'm taking my naked palette and I'm using the color naked and i'm going to use this as my transition color in the crease you can just take any light brown color now i'm taking my too faced natural and night palette and I'm going to be using this color right here called moonstone it is a really pretty Goldie kind of green it's so nice and i'm going to be putting that on half of my eyelid on the inner half I'm taking that all the way up to the crease but i'm not putting any on the outer be right here now I'm gonna be taking this color right next to it called night fever which is a deeper green with gold glitter and this is what's going to be going right on the outer part of my eye again I'm still a little sick so I still sound a little recipe forgive me I don't know when I'm going to get rid of this cold now i'm going back into the Naked palette and I'm getting the color right here called book and I'm taking that on a fluffy little crease brush and I'm just going to blend out the colors in my crease ok so after I've done that I'm going back into my natural night palette and I'm going to go back into these colors right here and do the exact same thing I did first only I'm going to be adding 6+2 my brush and this is just going to intensify the color a lot more ok so next I'm gonna be taking my 217 i'm going in with this color in the natural night palette and it is called Coco star like a really pretty brown even explain it but it's really nice and I'm just going to be taking this into the outer be right here and then bring it into the crease I'm bringing that a little bit above my crease as well then just taking a fluffy brush like this didn't get into that naked color and just kind of blending that out a little bit more by the way added virgin as my problem honey I don't know why did that off camera now I'm just going to add some eyeliner I'm using the Maybelline master drama eyeliner in midnight master which is just a black and I'm going to tight line with this and add it to my waterline for my lower lashline and i'm going to be taking the brown in the natural at night palette here and i'm going to be putting that on the outer part of my lower lashline the sky just turned black because it knew i was filming and I know I say sorry in every video so I'm not going to do it this time but just know the side turn black of course of course i know i keep going back and forth between these two pallets but what can you do i'm going to take half baked from the Naked palette and I'm going to add that right here where this gold is but i'm going to add X plus 2 the brush just to intensify it may get a lot more vibrant and gold yeah I'm going to take spotlight right here and this is gonna be my highlight right in here ok so now i'm just going to add some mascara and you can go ahead and add some winged liner to this look if you want but i like how it looks just like this my mascara that I'm using is my jordana best / extreme i'm using this on my top lashes and then for my bottom lashes i'm using be it's so big volumizing mascara i got this in an empty bag and it actually works pretty well my bottom lashes and makes them super long so that's what I'm going to do right now ok so these are finished eyes if you want to see what is going to go on the rest of my face then just keep watching ok so i already filled in my eyebrows i'm really not a fan of how I am green eye shadow looks at me I know I feel like it just doesn't look good with my eye color anyway the prime using today is my lauriol magic Lumi Jason never use this as a primary and now I use it all the time it just makes my skin feel so nice the foundation i'm going to be using today is the Maybelline fit me concealer i have been using this foundation and i gotta say i love it as foundation i really wish that the fit me foundation had the same creaminess and consistency as the consider does because honestly this is foundation to me it's not think it's not cakey and it doesn't make my dry skin look dry and it has the coverage because it's a concealer is awesome of course i use a crap ton of product so I waste this pretty easily but I like it going to be using my Beauty Blender yeah for my under eyes I'm using my Maybelline instant age rewind dark circle eraser crank this up yeah yeah underneath my eyes I'm using my mineralize skinfinish natural and I always do because it's the bomb diggity your browser I'm using the Sonia Kashuk warm bronzer I mean cream bronzer in warm tan just click this and I use that with a real techniques buffing brush I like this because it gives a very subtle bronze i'm going to should have left my hair up huh yeah see it's not too pigmented where it looks a little scary just kinda looks like a natural bronze glow to your face I really love that for blush I'm using Mac's Melba it is a matte peachy kind of blush i'm giving a pretty simple on my lips I'm just using the NYX butter gloss in creme brulee ok guys that's it i wanted to do a pretty sultry I look and then keep it pretty natural and fresh on the rest of my face so I hope you like this tutorial let me know down below if you did please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look I was so surprised at how many people wanted a tutorial on this look I was wearing this in my empties video and there were a ton of comments telling me that I needed to sit down and film this video so i did I didn't think I was going to because the look is literally so easy it's like easiest look ever but i love this look I think it's so romantic and pretty kind of like a serial like a soft pink yeah this is actually a talk through makeup tutorial and if you want to see how to get this look on my face then just keep watching so I'm gonna start off with my face since the eyes are so simple i don't really get a lot of fallout with this look I'm going in with the Knicks born to glow illuminating primer and i'm just using this on my skin to help it look nice and glowy this stuff is so similar to the max stroke cream and it's way way more affordable the foundation going to be using today is the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation it's the same foundation i was wearing in my empties video I have a love-hate relationship with this foundation sometimes i like it sometimes i hate it i like it for the most part by the way i'm using the shade porcelain i like it for the most part but it can look pretty cakey around my nose sometimes it just looks heavy on my skin I don't know why but I like it's just I don't know i'm using a sponge from the brand mascara it's really really similar to the Beauty Blender and it's more affordable because you're going to be using today is the tart shape concealer I can't seem to use any other concealer i mean i do everything I have other concealers i love but these are just my favorite right now and it's making me want to go on another snapchat declutter I kind of stopped that series because there was nothing else I really wanted to declutter but after discovering this amazing concealer I want to kind of get rid of some of them because is I don't really use them so i'm just adding a little bit on the inner corners right here to then blend it out I mixed the shades light/medium and fair and i'm just going to blend that out you really do not need a lot of this concealer I know when it comes to youtube videos like you'll see youtubers just like paint on the concealer like i do i always like paint on my concealer but for this one specifically I feel like you don't need to do that because a little goes such a long way so I'm thinking of doing that you really really really want to give away or get rid of a couple of my concealers because this one is just so amazing just a couple just a couple just get rid of a couple i'm going to take a little bit of the shade fair and apply it to areas i kinda want to highlight a little bit I'm going to go in with another cream product and then i'll set my under eye concealer and all that so I'm going to take my cover effects custom enhancer drops in the shade sunkist this is the bronze shade the light one i have been using this as bronzer i love it so much I just take some in the back of my hand after I shake it a bit and with that same sponge I used for foundation and concealer i'm just going to apply some to my face I think this might be the best liquid bronzer i have ever come across in my life it just blends so well into the skin i'm going to apply some more for the other side of my face Celine learned how to open my door now looks like I'm gonna have to change the doorknobs no privacy with that one I called my door and asked her to stay outside cuz i'm filming and changes opens it she's like yeah no I'm coming in gonna add some to my doll line here ok so now i'm going to go ahead and set my under eye concealer and set areas of my face when I feel like it needs to be set i'm going to take my rms beauty one powder just kind of like a translucent HD powder and with this 24 procon tour number 79 brush i'm just going to set everything so after powdering my face looks a little bit more mad than I wanted to so what I did was I went in with this shimmery bronzer it's so dark like this is way too dark for my skin tone so I have to make sure i use a super super night hand this is an alpha mineral bronzer in the shade beach bronze i'm going to take this pressure here i bought it at all so this is the it cosmetics for alta line exclusively at ulta and this is their airbrush powder brush I'm gonna take a little bit and I'm going to really tap this off ok so i'm going to go ahead and do the eye makeup because I really feel like I need to do my eyes already okay so I lied apparently there is fallout with this look because of the glitter I completely forgot about that for some reason so i would suggest doing your eyes first before your face makeup i'm going to take my surprise rhymes Anasazi and water one is long and i'm going to take this shaver here called ball fresco and i'm going to buff this into my crease using a more fiemme 441 brush i'm adding just a little bit of this color to my crease because i will go back into intensify it a little bit i'm going to take tempera which is this lightest shade at the front and i'm going to use that to highlight underneath my rubble and then i'm going to go in with this shining star right here this is the butter london a butter london something it doesn't say i hate when companies that was the name of this thing it's like a cream eyeshadow but it's not like a cream in my opinion it has a similar consistency to hair gel like really thick sculpting hair gel that is the consistency of this but they're just like little potted eyeshadows in jelly form this specific color is in the shade frosted and it's my favorite one they sent me like four shades this is so stunning my favorite way to apply this is with my finger so I'm just gonna dip my finger in there and I like to build up the coverage so i'll go in a couple times but I'll just start to apply this to my yeah I'm not trying to flick you off i promise i know it's my middle finger but it's not my intention and apply some more through a good thing about this eyeshadow is that it builds really well it doesn't get sticky and it lasts a long time I i I'm going to go back into the Anasazi palette and I'm gonna take ballbust Oh again i can't say that word normal and with that same crease brush I used earlier i'm going to add a little bit more of this eyeshadow ok I'll just go in with a little bit more of that frosted shade for my inner corners I'm going to mix these two shades together premier and primavera first i'm going with Vermeer and then i'm going to top it off with primera for my lower lashline I'm doing something extremely simple i'm going to go in with blonde fresco on a little pencil brush this is a tiny little ecotools shadow smudger brush I'm going to run that on my lower lashline and then over top of that i'm going to take burnt orange going to curl my lashes you can go ahead and wear falsies with my empties video I wasn't wearing any falsies so I'm just going to coat my top and bottom lashes with my benefit roller lash so that completes the is really simple and we're pretty much almost done when I filmed my empties video I wasn't wearing any blush i just went in with my highlight and I used my makeup geek highlighting palette and I first went in with the pink shade this is called Starling i'm going to try out this brush this is the morphe are 36 and dip it into that starlight shade you definitely want to tap off the excess when you're using these highlights because they're extremely pigmented and then i'm going to go over top with the shade night light which is the lightest gold shade I'm going to mix the shade nightlight and starlight and highlight the nose a little bit and I'm going to take just starlight and highlight my Cupid's will for lips i was wearing a very very very nude lip almost concealer like but i think it ties in with like the light pink ethereal look I'm going in with the buxom true nude lip foundation in the shade but this is the lightest shade it's so light the trick with this specific color is you cannot apply too much I find that when i do that i get that disgusting white thing on the inside of my mouth you know what i'm talking about so i actually have to tap this on my mouth and then I just blend in and then i went over it with the colour-pop ultra glossy lip in the shade fairy floss this is my favorite shade of all of the new color pop glasses it's just like a very very light nude but it's not too pigmented it's a sheer formula i love it i find that glosses this color that are too pigmented give you that weird thing you think I was talking about ok guys so that completes the look i really hope you guys enjoyed it i love looks like this was like a super nude lip and everything kind of like monochromatic i hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys hey guys so today's video is going to be a tiny get ready i haven't done one of these videos in a really long time I feel so I decided that is what i want to do today and it's also going to be kind of like a one brand video not a one brand tutorial because I don't have a specific look in mind i'm just going to chat with you guys and some makeup on but it is going to be using these two for our collection products i asked you guys on Twitter recently not that recently but I asked you guys on Twitter if you wanted to see a one brand video using the Sephora collection which if you don't know it's pretty much so for us brands like so for ourselves a bunch of different brands but they also have their own personal brand called sephora collection and it's a lot more affordable than their other brands sold there it's not necessarily drugstore prices but not very high end either for some of these are actually going to be first impressions some of these already tried by the way I know I know I know I know no i did not post a video monday or wednesday today is Friday I never go this long without posting a video my last video was a week ago that is so unlike me but I couldn't post the video on monday because this weekend was completely crazy i had no time and then monday came and the people who are installing our closets and the people who are it's only our curtains and windows came at the same time so I had people making so much noise here monday i couldn't film they had to come back to finish tuesday i couldn't film and then yesterday we had to come back to finish I could have felt so today I decided okay finally I can sit down the phone and yesterday i woke up with a cold and I was like oh no I'm not going to let a stuffy nose and a fever stop me from filming know so please excuse the fact that i have a cold story of my life find to drink more vitamin C ok so i'm going to go ahead and get started I've got my little coffee so now that it's officially spring i bought a new little headband to use in my tutorials oh isn't it beautiful I love him my little hearts might make a comeback next fall in would i bought these at forever 21 ok so I'm going to start off with a primer I'm gonna actually start off with my face makeup i'm going to be using these two for our Beauty amplifier after Google primer and lou manizer from the Sephora collection all of these products are from the support brand so i'm not going to say that every time because i know that's our knowing this product is pretty new I've never tried it before so this is like a first impression it comes out a really beautiful like gold liquid this is kind of reminding me of the door glow maximizer that's like super super expensive this has like a similar feel to it I don't know it could be something I like ok so now that is on my face i'm actually going to go ahead and do my eyebrows I always do my eyebrows off camera but i had bought a stew for a brow product this is there retractable brow pencil and it's waterproof and I got rich chestnut not sure if this matches me the only thing I don't like right off the bat when I look at it is the little comb it's not a spoolie it's like a comb and I'm not into these like they hurt like how scratching my forehand so I'm just going to go ahead and do my eyebrows it's a little reddish for my brows like it's a very warm brown actually really like it I like it it's really easy to use I don't like the color it's a little bit red for my hair blue for this video it's okay like I don't understand why they don't just put a spoolie like what is this little fork now i'm going to go ahead with this so for a brow thickener which I don't need this shit I don't need any more thickness but it's like a brow powder it's so strange i've never tried this before either this is in the shade medium brown some vodka maybe this will told him down the redness well that will blow you know what this is cool for sometimes when you use a pencil you kind of missed certain spots this is really cool to just go over those spots you missed or if you have really really full brows and you only need a little bit of like something this is pretty cool my browser not twins today just regular old sisters ok so for foundation i bought 2 to 4 brand foundations I have the perfection mr. airbrush foundation because a lot of you guys said it was a dupe for my dior air flash and then i bought the 10-hour where perfection foundation I was going to try this one out today but this is way too dark for me this is like my tanning shaidan is not down so i'm going to use this 1i got the shade light it says its oil free and has a second skin technology has medium coverage paraben free fragrance free formulated without mineral oil non-comedogenic sounds great great great so it looks pretty thick it's not very liquidy we shall see i prefer kind of like more liquidity the pump on this foundation is really amazing like you could really control how much you take out ok so that is a pump and a half of foundation i'm not exactly sure the finish of it because i use a very luminizing primer underneath so right now it's looking really like Dewey and radiant it has some tackiness to it for sure I'm going to go in with some concealer this is their bright future gel serum concealer and i've heard mixed reviews about this concealer this is another product i've never used before a lot of these products i just bought I heard that some people like it but the application sucks because it's the weirdest thing but product doesn't get on the entire wand only at the very tip so you do have to like it's meant to be dotted but you can't really like rub because no product comes off so you have to like constantly dip your wand back into the concealer which is really weird and kind of time consuming so that's kind of lonely around enough my slumber because i have a cold i do have like some discoloration on my eyelids so I'm dragging that on my lids I don't know I know how I feel about that I don't know how i feel about this concealer it's a little bit cakey on my skin but it didn't blend out nicely mmm ok so i'm going to go ahead and set my under eye concealer I don't have a translucent powder from sephora this is their micro smooth baked face compact and medium which looks hella dark I'm just going to set my face using the NARS translucent crystal powder i'm going to apply just a really light layer of this powder to my face using it was a mild simple brush because I do feel like this foundation needs to be set it's a little bit tacky so recently i purchased the bronzing powder in low squabbles this is what it looks like i really really love this but I saw that they came out with a sculptor like a contour product in the shade lowest cobbles this is still being sold on this afore website purchase this one just in case anybody was wondering if there's a difference like if it's exactly the same why are they selling both of them and they're pretty much the same color but this one is much more pigmented let me show you okay so i'm going to swatch this one is so much more pigmented this one is a lot softer so I don't know what the dealio with that is but today I'm going to contour using this one because it is a little bit less pigmented so I don't want to go in with such a heavy hand I kind of might prefer this one over the other would because it lets you it lets you build up the color but if you aren't as fair as me then definitely go for the like og because it's you'll get a better color payoff so is anybody caught up with how to get away with murder i'm not going to ruin it i'm not going to say any spoilers but I don't even know how to feel about that finale I'm not going to spoil it but i do like Frank and I know that I shouldn't because Frank is not a good person at all but i do like Frank I don't know why what is wrong with me and also sign no I am 100-percent completely over scandal I was obsessed with scandal guys like it was my issue you know I was so team jacob was all about that show but now it's just it's gotten to the point where it's like okay put a lid on this show and I'm sorry for those of you really really still love it I just can't deal with Olivia Pope anymore she is a stone-cold biatch I don't know and I just don't like where the show is going I'm like so incredibly bored it's a snoozefest I haven't seen like the last three episodes how to get away with murder scandal No ok so I really really really like this product it gave me a very soft natural contour as opposed to this would be a little bit stronger but I like them both with a tan I might want to use something more pigmented I don't know this is so weird but I'm going to go in with blush next and i'm going to be using one these blushes and I have the shade can't stop smiling which is a really pretty peach and then so shy which is like a nice bubble gum pink I'm actually gonna go with the peach one cuz I'm might be doing like a regular bronzy I the usual you know it's not a tutorial now i'm going to highlight and to be completely honest i'm not a big fan of any of the highlighting products so for a collection has I tried one of their illuminators that look like this it comes in this packaging and I did not like i have these sephora radiant luminizing drops this is in morning light i'm going to try to death some of this on my cheekbones even though i already applied powder but what about okay so i just added a little bit of something I didn't want to disrupt my foundation underneath and my blush which I kind of did so I'm going to take the illuminator in this little trio it's a very very subtle highlight like you don't get much from this at all there's not much color payoff at all at all actually want a little bit more glowing assign oh that's crazy but I'm going to take this sephora baked blush duo and mango being i love these like luminous so for blushes they're amazing add some right here ok so I'm going to do my eyes keep in mind when you use products like this you can use these wet so if you want even more intense highlight you can what this now i'm going to move on to my eyes I'm going to do something very very simple i'm going to use their baked eyeshadow trio in indian summer i'm actually going to use the bronzer shade in this to use as my crease shade and I'm gonna buff this into the crease I use the bronzer as eyeshadow all the time I'm going to take my brush and spray mac fix+ Honor this is a mac 239 and then I'm going to go into this shade right here it's a really pretty bronzy taupe color and i'm going to use that all over my lid wedding the eyeshadow is definitely going to intensify it and these baked products are awesome too wet because you don't mess up the eye shadow then I'm going to go into this really dark chocolatey shade this is a sophie 320 brush kind of like a mac 217 and I'm going to pack that on my outer corners not going to wet my brush I only want just a little bit of depth for my waterline i'm going to take the waterproof retractable eyeliner in the shade and deep plum mat deep plum and I've never tried this before and it's not my favorite the colour-pop liners are like five dollars and they are so much more pigmented in this my gosh that is totally a bus for me like struggle to put that on I'm going to blend that out using the chocolate color I'm going with mascara next and I didn't buy a mascara because i'm a fool so I'm going to go in with mike eagle extra sculpt ok so we are pretty much done here I'm just going to go in with my lip combo I'm going with the sephora ruse Joe lip liner in the shade nothing but nude as I haven't used this color before I just bought it but i have used this formula and it's amazing i really love these lip liners this is such a pretty lip liner I love it and the formula i love it a lot of it I'm gonna go over it with this guy right here I don't even know what this is called just saw it on the support website and i was like wow that looks really pretty color I don't even know what the name of it is I don't know if it's like their lip balm and lip stick thing but it comes in this packaging and this is in the shade number one yeah I have no idea like who I like that it's still pretty and it feels so comfortable on the lips had a really good color payoff I can't smell it because my nose is stuffy but i really like that ok guys so that completes this look I know that this video wasn't very chatty but honestly I'm just under the weather and I don't feel the best but I had to get a video up so i'm sorry if i wasn't very entertaining in this video I'm sorry some of these definitely were hits and some of these definitely misses the primer amazing i gave my skin really glowy look I really really like that so far this foundation looks good it does look like second skin it's not too bad actually think I don't like this because all the places where i apply the concealer made my skin look a little bit cakey great broad product if it was less warm and it came with a spoolie but i really like it and this product is pretty cool too this is a great little contour amazing not a fan of the highlight in this really really loved the blush I love their blushes they're baked ones and their color for one's awesome blushes and while this is really pretty it only works wet because this brown chain i was having a hard time like applying it to my lid and i'm also not a fan at all this eyeliner but i really really really really love their lip liner formula and this like lip balm nude number one thing is beautiful love it so that completes this video I hope you guys enjoy thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video hey guys so today's video is going to be a tutorial using the electric palette from urban decay please excuse that . on my eyelid I did it with my eyeliner by mistake at the end of this video and it upset me I know but let's pretend this lone pair shall we so this look is really fun and dramatic and I know it's not for everybody but i just think it's really cool and I do basic everyday tutorials on my channel all the time so I decided to switch it up let's go so the first thing i want to do is I'm going to take max painterly Paint Pot and i'm going to apply this to my entire lid this is going to act as a base cover up any redness and find my eyes as well going into the Urban Decay palette i'm going to take the color called chaos it is a really bright royal blue and I'm gonna pack this on my entire lid and then forgot that I had an added tape to the corner of my eye so i quickly add that this is just gonna make a cat eye effect and make everything look sharp and clean so I'm just gonna pack this on my entire lid and bring it up to decrease next I'm going to take this milani eyeshadow called below cafe i believe and I'm just gonna bust this into my crease as a transition shade it's just going to help that blue blend out a little bit more next I'm going to take this eyeshadow and the pally called urban it is a beautiful purple and i'm going to start building this color in my crease with a mac 217 this part is super tedious and it takes a lot of work but just go back and forth in the eye shadow and build up the color little by little because it is such an intense color you are going to want to build this up and work very very slowly and just pack it on a little by little I know it can be time consuming but it's better to do it this way they look like you have way too much in the crease so I'm just going back and forth dipping my brush in the eye shadow and slightly blending it into my crease then i'm going to go back into chaos and pack this onto my lid because a lot of it and get blended away from all the blending we did these two colors look really cool layered on top of each other because it looks like three different eye shadows on my lid when really there's just two of them it's really cool so now back with my - 17 I'm going back into the urban shade and building it again like I said little by little i'm also dragging it that brush into my crease really really lightly so that it can blend seamlessly so I'm packing most of the color right in the socket of my crease and then with the really light hand I'm trying to feather it out higher in my crease if that makes any sense and then again some more packing on of that chaos color I know time-consuming just going to go back and forth between these two eyeshadows now I'm just going to clean up some of the fallout with any makeup remover wipe and then I'm going to take the Urban Decay Naked basics palette i'm going to go into that shade foxy and I'm going to blend this underneath my brow bone this is just gonna help that purple color blend out a little bit better then I don't know why I didn't record myself doing that but I dip this brush into the shimmery shade in The Naked basics palette and apply that to my energy or dust and underneath my brow bone to highlight now I'm just gonna add some winged eyeliner I'm going to take my la girl very black gel eyeliner and just add a wing and then of course I got so close I got out of focus as per usual I'm going to move on to the rest of my face and I'm going to take my Too Faced hangover primer and this is just going to prime my face and moisturize my face really well next I'm gonna mix two foundations and they're both the Rimmel stay matte foundation and i'm just going to buff this into my skin using a real techniques expert face brush I'm going to quickly skim through the face like I usually do because you know it's something you've seen very many times before and I think people are more interested in the eye look at this video then what's on the rest of my face I'm gonna take my Maybelline fit me consider I believe this is in the shade 0 light or 15 bear i'm not exactly sure I think it's 10 and I'm just gonna cover my dark circles with this and highlight my face a little bit i'm going to set everything using Mac's emphasize powder and i'm using this on an elf flawless concealer brush I believe that's the name now i'm going to take this milani jumbo pencil in the shade royal purple and i'm going to use this as my eyeliner this is just going to make the look look extra probably on the bottom / believe yeah i know i'm going to take carbon again on a pencil brush and just much this underneath my lash line yeah then I'm going to dip that pencil brush into milania's Bella cafe and i'm going to further smoke it out so it looks nice and smoky on the bottom I'm just going to drag it towards the winged eyeliner i don't know if you can tell I'm just dragging it up towards the wing and I should have zoomed in this part but I completely forgot of course then I'm just going to quickly curl my lashes at the mascara and then i'm going to apply some falsies i'm going to use the R del wispies and then i'm going to finish off my face I'm going to take been nice powder Rouge in the shade contour number one and unequal tools brush I'm going to contour my face I'm going to take this tart blush in the shade exposed I don't want something super pigmented or noticeable on my cheeks and my eyes are already so loud so I'm going for a natural blush lipstick I'm going to use my Too Faced lipstick in the shade nude beach and yeah it's really pretty new color love this lipstick taking my physicians formula stripper stripper no shimmer strip while shimmer strips and natural nude i'm going to use this to highlight ok guys so that completes this look I really hope you enjoyed it thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys today's videos in makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right here this is using the Anastasia i keep saying Anastasia and I'm trying to teach myself to say anastacio artists palette this just recently came out i purchased my nap ulta.com I don't know if they're still in stock or not but i'm pretty sure i purchased it like the Dare than the day after it came out I wanted to buy it because i have so many neutral palette and this one just looked different to me because they do have other neutral colors thrown in the mix this is actually a really really easy like ridiculous like ridiculously easy makeup tutorial which is ok right because it's like one Shadow kind of and I feel like there's so many tutorials out there that it's like real that are really hard to recreate and I feel like this is pretty easy to recreate I know it's a little bit out there because it has like that super bowl yellow under I and in person it's a lot more intense like I didn't think this yellow color would be as intense as it is which I'm glad it is because it's really pigmented they're really like it so far so yeah I like this palette give it a big thumbs up and if you want to see how to give these Luke I've been my whole face but if you want to get this look then just keep watching I'm going to prime my eyelids with Mac's painterly Paint Pot it is my all-time favorite you guys know I'm gonna take the artist Shalit what the artist palette and the shadow called buttery it's a creamy matte vanilla shade and i'm going to set that paint pot with that shadow I'm gonna take dusty rose it's a beautiful Dessi rose color a little bit mabi it's seriously stunning one of my favorites in this palette and it blends like a dream and I'm going to apply that in windshield wiper motions into my crease using a big fluffy blending brush this matte purple color is called aubergine and its really really pigmented but you do have to kind of like work in little sections so i'm using this on a flat shader brush and I'm just packing that onto my eyelid and that's going on my entire lid but I'm not gonna take it past the crease with a smaller fluffy brush really similar to the mac 217 this one's just from Sophie I'm going to go back into that dusty rose shade and then I'm going to blend out the harsh lines that the aubergine shade kind of made if that makes sense now I'm going back into that flat shader brush and I'm doing the whole thing all over again because a lot of the color does get blood away once you start blending in the crease i'm just doing it all over again and then taking a little bit more of the dusty rose and just blowing out the look i wanted to be really smoky in the crease and kind of played nicely i'm going to take a small little brush and add the buttery shade underneath my brow bone to kind of lift the brow a little bit so I'm going to start on my face I was like crying because I was watching The Voice which constantly makes me cry but anyway i'm taking the Makeup Forever hydrating primer and i'm applying that to my entire face and then I'm gonna mix both of the Maybelline matte and poreless and the original fit the original foot me is a lot more dewy and the matte and poreless is obviously not and poreless they're both from the fit me line but I find that combining both of them together i get such a natural beautiful finish and i'm using an elf stippling brush to apply that or concealer i'm using my Mac Pro Longwear and I'm taking this on like a pointy little brush from sedona lease and then this I'm what I'm going to drag it across my I to kind of sharpen the makeup the eye makeup as you just saw if that makes sense so yeah covering my dark circles and then cleaning everything up with this concealer as well and i'm also highlighting a little bit more with my maybelline dream lumi magically dream lumi touch highlighting concealer in ivory so i am adding some more underneath my eyes and then highlighting other parts of my face with this concealer as well and then I'm just going to blend that all and using that same brush I used to blend out or to apply my mac concealer I feel like it cannot speak today I don't know what's wrong with me so I'm going to take my favorite product ever this is the two-faced cocoa contour kit and I'm gonna take this morphy blush brush and I'm going to dip it into the shade like cocoa and this is gonna set my concealer and bring a lot of light underneath fine it's a beautiful like Matt the kind of the glowy highlighting powder i love it so I'm gonna finish off my eyes before I go on to the rest of my face I'm gonna take this color called brush is a very vibrant Matt bright yellow and on a sigma pencil brush I'm going to apply that underneath my lower lashline i'm going to drag it down pretty far as you can see on my other eye I yeah i'm also gonna bring that into my teacher just as well and i'm going to be very very messy with this i'm going to apply that sucker all over my lower lashes and i'm going to extend it to wear the purple is as well I'm gonna take this buttery shade again buttery yeah buttery shade again and on that same pencil brush I'm just gonna go over my inner tear duct because i don't want to start yellow on the inner corners just like a light yellow this is the NYC liquid eyeliner my favorite it's nice black and Matt and I love it and I'm just going to do a typical wing and of course i can never catch that on camera so yeah just do the wing like I normally do i added some false lashes and i'm using the L'Oreal telescopic mascara on my lower lashes not too much because i don't want to take away from the yellow under I but that pretty much completes the eye makeup now I'm going to contour using the medium cocoa powder in this contouring kit this one is like a very cool tone brown so it's perfect for contouring and i'm using that on my brush there my friend got her Ipsy bag and gave it to me so yeah i'm using that to contour i love this for contouring it's the perfect undertone seriously beautiful and it smells like Coco so you know I like eat so I just contouring my face like I normally would sides of my nose and my jawline and all that stuff and now I just want to warm up my cheeks a little bit so I'm taking a fluffier brush this is from zoeva and I'm dipping it into the medium cocoa shade in the kit it's a lot warmer as you can see there was something on that brush don't know what that was but it's warmer so it gives a nice warm to the skin it's nice i love it like i love it so much the only thing i don't like about the contouring kit is that shimmery highlight I don't like it at all like glittery weird so to highlight my cheekbones i'm using this elf sunkist bronzer in the shade sunkist you can't tell on camera but it gives the most beautiful golden glow and it's two dollars i love it now I'm going to line my lips using the two-faced perfect lips lip liner in the shade perfect nude i love this lip liner it's like my favorite I've talked about it plenty of times we have just gonna overdraw my lips just a tiny bit not too crazy but yeah I'm gonna do that and then just fill them in and then i'm going to go over it with a lipstick this is revlon's super lustrous lipstick in the shade of pink cognito it's a nice shiny lipstick i love it and then that completes make a book i really hope you guys enjoyed thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video

excited for this video because this video is sponsored by benefit which is exciting because i love benefit and in today's video I'm going to be using their cheekathon palette this is their blush kit and its really really nice because you get five full-size products in this palette and even though this is a blush get you still get a nice bronzer in there as well so it comes with a rocket or blush which is probably my favorite benefit blush of all time I love it hoola bronzer dandelion blush coralista blush and Dallas blush / bronzer I feel like this one could be both you also get the little brush that comes in all of their box powders I really love that they put this in the kit because it's perfect to contour with have been some pool contour a little bit this palette retails for fifty eight dollars but everything in here is full size so the value is actually a hundred and forty five dollars like if you were to buy all of these products separately it would be like a hundred and forty five bucks but you can save some moolah and get this kit for 58 which is awesome so I will link this product in the description box below in case you want to check it out I love it and if you want to see how to get this fun wearable neon glow a springy cool look and just keep watching so before i get into the story I wanted to show you guys some behind-the-scenes footage of my photo shoot

into the tutorial now so to start off this look I'm going in with my glossy a priming moisturizer it's a very very hydrating a primer i love it now i'm going in with foundation this is the key go universal-fit hydrating foundation I'm putting this on with my peer sponge I love this foundation it's not to do it but it's not mad either it's like a perfect blend the perfect in between I'm going to go in with some concealer this is the Catrice waterproof liquid camouflage concealer i love this concealer its full coverage and I really really like how it blends out it blends effortlessly so I'm just blending that in with the same sponge I applied with my foundation now i'm gonna just add a little bit of something underneath the eyes to highlight a bit this is dandelion shy beam it's like a map pinky highlight so it's perfect to brighten up the under eyes i'm going to set that concealer down using my RC ma no color powder i'm also going to set my eyelids because i did use that concealer kind of like a primer for the eye shadow so I'm just sitting down everywhere I put some concealer now i'm going into the benefit cheekathon palette i'm going to take this little benefit bamboo brush and I'm going to dip it into hula and i'm just going to bronze up the skin with this brush I'm going to go in and contour in a second but i'm just using this brush to lightly apply some hula all over Z face now i'm going to take the little contour brush in the kit and i'm going to start to contour with this brush and then I'm going to flip it on its side to kind of blend everything out for blush I'm going to mix two shades together i'm gonna take the coralista blush and rocket or I really like the combo of these two blushes and i'm going to apply these to my sheiks now i'm going to highlight my face using the makeup revolution shimmer brick in the shade radiant it's a very intense highlight as you can see very intense take your time to blend this out but it is very very beautiful and very affordable i love it so to set all those powders down i just took my pixie milky hydrating mist and spread that all over my face and now i'm going to move on to my eyes first I'm going to take makeup geeks Peach Smoothie eyeshadow i'm going to use this as a transition shade i love the warm peachy color in this eyeshadow amazing i love it now i'm going to go in with Poppy also by make a peek i'm using all makeup geek eyeshadows in today's tutorial and i'm going to start slowly dragging this color into the crease I want it concentrated on the outer corners of my eyes and in my crease as well so i'm just taking that a nice fluffy blending brush and blending that it next I took makeup geeks mocha and i'm applying this only on the outer corners just to add a little bit of depth I wanted a color that was a little bit deeper and more natural so I took a dark brown just the violence balance everything out then I took I'm peach list this is a duochrome eyeshadow and i'm applying this to the inner corners and a little bit like on the top and bottom like inner half there just to brighten and highlight those sections and for underneath my brow bone I didn't want something too shimmery so I took white lies which is a nice matte vibrant white so for the lower lash line I'm just taking peach smoothie on a pencil brush and pretty much putting this everywhere buffing that right in my lower lash line and then I'm taking this amazing color pop eyeliner in the shade puppy sony on so intensely orange it's amazing i'm putting that on my waterline and then to blend things out a little bit i'm taking papi and blending it really really close to the eyeliner just so that everything you know there's no harsh lines or anything then I took Peach Smoothie one more time and blended the crap out of poppy and yeah then I curl my lashes this was before I burned off my eyelashes on that I yes this video is pretty recording before I did that and i'm looking at my eyelashes and i'm getting a little sad but you know what it's just eyelashes let's move on i'm applying benefits roller lash and then to finish off this look I'm just applying my lip color this is over a long lasting liquid lipstick in the shade sao paulo but I didn't want a matte finish i wanted something a little bit glossy so on top of that i took the Knicks sugar pie lip gloss and just put that right on top and then that completes this video I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look it's a very strong makeup look at least for me and actually had a mishap well this whole video was a hot mess but I'm still gonna post it anyway the foundation color didn't match because it's my self tan shade and I'm not tan right now and then while i was using my cocoa contour kit I was contouring with the cool tone color here and then I accidentally dip my brush into dark cocoa without looking and then stamped on my forehead here but i love the eye makeup so much this is the second time that I've done it um not on camera I decided to film it because I wore this I looked the other day and I loved it so I decided to film it for you since all my looks on my channel are very natural daytime appropriate i wanted to switch it up so this is the way it came up with and if you want to see it again as Luke then just keep watching so I'm going to prime my eyes using the Mac prep and prime 24-hour extent that I base this is by far my favorite color list primer this is an anastacio eyeshadow in the shade stone and i'm going to use this as my transition shade just buffing this into my crease so everything blends nicely on top this is a mac pro longwear pain pops in the shade genuine treasure I'm not exactly sure if this will limit in tissue not i bought mine on the back website not that long ago either so I just pop that on my entire lid and now i'm taking the morphe eye shadow in the shape deep skin and blending that into my crease some more just to warm it up then I'm taking make it Peaks white lies eyeshadow and highlighting with that now for my favorite part i'm going to add fix+ to my brush and I'm going into the Urban Decay eyeshadow in the shade dymond dog it's a super super sparkly eyeshadow it's one of their moondust shadows it's so worth it i love it so I applied that to my entire lid and I'm taking makeup geeks bit in shadow and on a tiny little blending brush I'm just precisely adding this into the crease and that's all I pretty much it and then I took deep skin again from morphe and I'm just blending everything out so things are nice and seamless I'm going to take um scheme' by makeup geek and white lies and layer them on top of each other in my inner corner and now i'm going to add just like a pop of color something a little bit different i decided to add some green eyeliner and this is from ga it's called their liquid shimmer eyeliner and this is in the shade links so i'm just applying a tiny little wing super easy nothing too fancy just a little pop of something so now i'm going to prime my face using be two-faced and hangover RX primer and then i went in with the covergirl stay luminous foundation the luminous foundation and then I realize oh this is not my shade this is my summer she a season but I just went with it anyway you know mistakes happen sometimes ok so i'm just going to blend that in and try my best now i'm going to apply some concealer just to see if i can help with the color situation so i'm using more than I normally do but this is the Maybelline fit me concealer in the shade 5 fair and i'm just highlighting applying this under my eyes all over my face and I'm going to blend that in with a real techniques blush brush so usually blend my concealer in about a million times so i decided to skip over that now I'm going to take my two phase cocoa contour kit this is a real techniques setting brush and I'm going to set my under eye concealer using the light Coco shade which is like the whitish shade in the palette and then i'm setting everywhere else I apply the concealer taking this morphy pencil brush I'm going to take that eyeshadow called deep skin by more feet and I'm gonna blend that underneath my eyes this is an eyeshadow by NARS it's one of their duel and tend to the eyeshadows and I filmed this before the makeup geek dual chrome eye shadows came out so I would have just used in making pink one because it's much cheaper but i have been ours once i use it now i'm going to go in with the clinique chubby lash mascara this is like they're burgundy one and I think it gives a cool little twist to the look so that completes the eyes and now i'm going to go ahead and finish the face this is a foundation palette from mascara cosmetics I follow her on Instagram and I followed her blog for a really long time so this is a really really cool concept I'm going to take the brush that came with it and i'm going to use that contour shade at the cream it's a cream palette by the way i'm going to use the contour shade to just outline my face with that pointy part and then I'm going to flip the brush over and just blend out that cream contour this is the perfect shade because it has like that nice actually undertone so it's perfect for contouring now i'm going to go back into the tube a school contract and I don't know why I'm holding it out to the side like that I think that's super weird i'm holding out of them so I'm just going to start contouring my cheekbones with the azure shade in this kit I want something a little more dramatic and this is where accidentally put the wrong bronze on my forehead and I'm like freaking out like a you put the warm bronzer you're supposed to put the ashy one and then things went south a little bit but I hope and I fixed it a little bit so now i'm going to take the knee of urban decay blush is in the shade rapture I believe I have the correct name down below but i'm pretty sure it's rapture and this is a super dark blush but likely applied it's really pretty so that's what I did and then tie like my face I went in with the Natasha no glow palette in the shade 01 light and I highlight my cheekbones and my nose in any other place I would normally highlight so to finish off the look I'm going to apply this color pop ultra matte lip in the shade trap and then that completes makeup look I really hope you guys enjoy thank you so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is going to be a makeup tutorial on the look i'm wearing right now I was gonna do a child to get ready with me I was all ready for a try to get rid of me i have my wine about my throat is killing me still trying to get over my cold you're probably thinking like wow you had a cold for a long time now but i'm actually pre-recording videos because i'll be out of town when you're watching this so I didn't want to talk too much in this video so it is in voiceover I'm sorry but I will be recording a get ready with me is more often like chatty get ready with me is I hear your request I will be filming those more often but today i wanted to use the mecca and jaclyn hill champagne glow collection i used the face palette it's amazing amazing i'm not going to do like a whole review because i know there's like a hundred videos reviewing this already i just wanted to show you this look I used the eyeshadow palette the face palette and the liquid illuminator and all that I totally think I overdid it with the glow i'm like super glowy but that's the point it's a globally collection so if you want to see how to get this really dewy summary bronze a look and just keep watching ok so i'm starting off by priming my face using the backup primer this is the backlight priming filter and then i went in with the back wha equi becca aqua luminous foundation i have to speed this part up because you guys for some reason I just take forever to blend this into my skin it's just one of those foundations I really have to work in for it to look as natural as possible but when I do it's beautiful we can see where i'm using is the Catrice camouflage concealer at first this was going to be a one brand tutorial like I was going to do only backup products but then i realized i was using a couple of other things that were in becca so it just didn't end up happening but I use a lot of becca in this video so I'm just popping that in with my sedona lace 217 brush this time I can see I'm going to use my trusty it cosmetics bye bye pores pressed powder and i'm just setting my under eye concealer setting my eyes because i also used that concealer kind of as a primer for the future I'm just setting anywhere i put the concealer basically that's what I'm setting I'm gonna take the becca shimmering skin Perfector liquid in champagne pop I love it is beautiful i'm using a sponge to apply this to the tops of my cheekbones and on my nose and all the places i want to highlight this is a sponge from the brand mascara but you can use any spongy Beauty Blender the Real Techniques sponge they work really well with liquid highlights this is amazing i highly highly recommend you get the liquid version of champagne pop it is stunning like I definitely liked it a lot more than I thought I would I mean I I know you don't like it but I love it so I'm just friends at my skin with my physicians formula butter bronzer but then I wanted something a little bit warmer so I took out my kiko desert dunes bronzer this is like one of their new summer bronzers i bought it on the Kiko website and i got mine in the shade warm and i just use this to warm up my skin a little bit and now i'm using of the mecca and jaclyn hill champagne collection face palette is beautiful this mirror is insane it's it's amazing it's amazing the blush i'm going to use amaretto it's kind of like am at a warm peachy shade beautiful i love this blush it was the first time I used it and I love it was beautiful to highlight my cheekbones some more i took a little bit of prosecco pop and then i apply champagne pop on top recycled pop is just a little bit to gold for me but the combination of the two is really pretty so lamb at the highlight ok so now i'm going to take the eyeshadow palette i'm going to take the shade cordial and i'm going to use this in my crease I usually do 1i off camera but honestly I was totally winging this look like I didn't even know what I was gonna end up doing huh so I just you know winged it I'm going to take the marc jacobs twinkle pop in the shade three shakes and i'm applying this to my entire lid kind of like a base for the eyeshadow and blending that out with my finger and then I'm going to take the eyeshadow named champagne toast and i'm applying that right on top of the base i put down I've heard kind of like mixed reviews of this palette I think becca like did something with the formula i'm not sure what the buzz is but i actually really like my palette i think the quality is pretty good i'm taking the shade cognac and i'm applying that on the outer corners of my eyes and then dragging them into my crease and then taking a different brush and puffing out the edges so that there are no harsh lines I do that a couple times go back into cognac and then just buff out the edges then I took the shade bordeaux and added very little of this to the outer corners of my eyes i used a Chardonnay in the palette to highlight my brow bone and my inner corners this is a makeup geek eyeliner full-spectrum eyeliner in the shape room area and i'm using this to apply to my waterline and then I take bordeaux on a pencil brush and kind of just buff it out I don't want my waterline to look to read so adding the eyeshadow and buffing that out kind of helps and then I took cognac and just did the same thing and then I skipped false lashes and applied tons of mascara for my lips I'm using the Milani lipstick in the shade Matt naked and that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching and please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey guys so today's video is a makeup tutorial on this look it's just a really glittery dark grey gunmetal smokey eye i'm using the gunmetal stack by not cosmetics i love their stacks I have all of them they're so good they are very very pricey but I feel like melt cosmetics there so innovative there so edgy i love Mel as a brand i will say if you're working with the gunmetal stack specifically you need to do your eyeshadow before you do the rest of your face makeup the last two shades in the stack these two right here this one is industrial and this one is gunmetal they have a lot of fallout a lot of follow even the top shade there's only one matte shade in the stack this one has a lot of fallout as well so you want to make sure you're doing your eyes first I did my eyes first and even I have some fallout on my face you have to be very careful with these I don't have that problem with the other stacks it's just this one specifically since they're kind of like pressed glitters their eyeshadows but they're very glittery and a framling if you want to see how to get this smoky eye and then just keep watching ok so I'm going to jump into eyeshadow because i already prime my eyelids eyelids are good to go and i'm going to take the shade assimilate from the melt cosmetics gunmetal stack and i'm using a fluffy brush and I'm just applying this into my crease and then I'm going to take my NYX glitter primer and with my finger i'm going to apply this to my entire lid I'm not passing the crease but I'm doing this because I went in with the shade gunmetal which is this shade right here and if i don't go in with a sticky base or like a glitter primer underneath there won't be much pigment like it'll just be a little glitters so adding the glitter primer really intensifies the eyeshadow now I'm going back in to assimilate on a smaller little crease brush and I'm really just buffing out this gun metal shade i will say it is a little bit difficult to work with just because this is a mat and we're trying to blend out a glitter it's kind of difficult but I did take my time with this i'm just going back and forth with the shade is so hey and blending up those edges I thought the look at me to just a hair of warmth so on a fluffy brush i took my physicians formula butter bronzer and I just blend it out the edges of the shade assimilate just so everything looks like a nice gradient to highlight underneath my brow bone I'm actually taking this makeup forever and 500 shade and putting that underneath my problem like i said to highlight then I went back in to assimilate on two different brushes and I'm just buffing out those edges it's just a lot of blending in the crease and since we did so much blending a lot of the glitter fell off so i went back in with gunmetal and just apply that to my lids and then I'm jumping into the face before I finish up the eyes this is a primer from the brand money it's their perfect 10 primer serum and I'm just testing that out right now and i'm also trying this primer out for the first time in this video this is the it cosmetics bye bye pores primer and so far so good it really did smooth out the skin i'm still testing it out but i think i really like it for foundation i went with i went in with the Loreal provo foundation this is the shade tool 3i believe and it just the undertone isn't right it doesn't match my skin perfectly but the formula is pretty good it gives your skin a natural finish for concealer i'm going in with my favorite this is the tart shaped concealer this is in the shade fair and i'm just highlighting my face and also covering up my dark circles and just blending of that in with a sponge to set my concealer i'm using the NYC smooth skin loose translucent setting powder and just I'm just setting all the places i apply the concealer because I don't feel like this foundation needs to be set the concealer dude so to finish off the eyes i'm taking a black eyeliner on my waterline and on my tight line this is the essence smoky black kajal fat chubby you know one of those control things it's really good and so affordable but for my lower lashline I'm just taking the shade assimilate and really blending that out and then I went into this wet and wild trio called plaid to the bone and i took the blue color and the trio and i'm blending this right on top of the assimilation shade to create kind of like a blue-gray color and I just blended that out and then I took some more of the Knicks glitter primer and i'm applying that to my inner corner so that i can go over it with this shade this one is called harsh tone white and with a little blush know little brush i'm applying that to my inner corners and dragging it onto my lid as well then i just applied some mascara and eye popped on some falsies i use the cocoa falsies in the shade Misha and that completes the I look for contouring i am using the cabinet quan sculpting powder in the shade light just to give myself a little bit of content and then I took the physicians formula butter bronzer on a bigger fluffier brush to really just bronze up the skin then for blush i took the Milania Rose blush in the shade awakening rose and I pop that on my cheeks i love this blush i bought mine on Amazon because i couldn't seem to find it anywhere i think it was limited edition but it's beautiful if you can find it get it and then highlight the tops of my cheekbones and my nose and all that good stuff i took the back of champagne pop highlight and just put in that everywhere as usual for lips and wanted a peachy color but I didn't think it was going to be a speech as this turned out this is the Kylie liquid lipstick in the shade dirty peach but it was a little bit to neon for me like it was a little bit unexpected i was a whole speech so I decided to take a nude gloss on top and I apply the dose of colors gloss in the shade undressed and then that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye so today's video is another makeup tutorial I'm on like makeup tutorial i'm on a makeup tutorial roll it is on this look right here I haven't used makeup geek products in awhile so i decided to just bust out my makeup geek eyeshadows so that yeah make a week I can't find the words today all the eyeshadows on my eyes are makeup geek is what I was trying to say it's like an icy green with a really intense lower lashline i know a lot of people don't really like lower lash like a super intense or lifetime but i think it's so like captivating i love super smoky lower lashline so that's why i kept the top really simple no liner like just like two eyeshadows pretty much and then I focused the drama on the bottom so yes my hair is a mess and so is the lighting the lighting in this video is like really off I feel because i'm filming really late at night which are usually film during the day so I don't have any sunlight at all in my room right now so I'm sorry that the lighting kind of sucks anyway if you want to get this look then just keep watching so for primer i am using the Mac painterly Paint Pot i use this all the time it masks the veins of Maryland's and I really like that this shadows for making me call the eyeshadows are from makeup geek this one is called babyface and i'm just using this to set the excuse my singing i'm just using that to set down the paint pot now i'm taking high tea i love this eyeshadow i highly recommend it it's a nice like olive green but it's really pigmented it's really amazing i don't know i really really love it so I'm taking one of her oiled eyeshadows and look at that look at that fullness its amazing by the way i'm recording this voiceover really really really really late in the middle the night so my voice is like cracking anyway this foil shadows called charmed and I started putting it on eyeshadow i mean with a brush and then i just finished putting it on with my finger I'm going right back into high tea just to blend everything out and then I'm going to take ice queen and this is gonna be my brow bone highlight i like it because it's not a flat white color it has like a sheen to it ok so this is a brand-new product i just got it the marc jacobs looks like a pill that's why I was a doing that and see marc jacobs undercover coconut primer I got it just because it said it had coconut in it and I feel like I put on a little bit too much this is the first time i used it and it smells faintly of coconuts not too much but it is really hydrating it basically feels like a super intense moisturizer I don't know if it's as good as the two-faced one just yet and here i am looking for a brush to put on my foundation but yeah let's move on i'm going to mix these two foundations this is the Too Faced Born This Way and the look L'Oreal True Match Lumi mentally yes the true match Leumi ok it's really late guys I love mixing the two because the two-faced one just gives you a flawless finish but adding the Loreal one makes it a little bit do here so i noticed that i didn't really match my neck much i'm not as tan as i usually am so it didn't match my next I'm like trying to drag it down and I'm like me yeah the color it's a little off so i'm just going to add a lot more concealer than usual to try to blend everything out i'm using the Maybelline better skin concealer I can't stop using this I wasn't a big fan of it at first and now it's like one of my favorites i cannot solve using it so i'm just applying this all over my face like I usually do just adding probably a little bit more than use and with my signal is 217 I am blending all that out yeah i'm going to set all of the concealer with the maybelline fit me powder in 135 creamy natural this is a real techniques contour brush by the way and i'm just using that to set everything ok so I'm gonna finish off my eyes and this part makes me cringe because you guys know I hate tugging on my eyes and I never really do but for some reason I did tonight this is the Milani shadow eyes chubby stick eyeliner thing in black and then I'm just smudging that out with like a little equal tools brush I'm going to work on smoking out that lower lashline this is dirty martini it's such a nice deep green i'm applying that right on top of the eyeliner and I put the black base so that it can look like a super super dark green so yes I'm just blending that out with a morphy pencil brush and I'm going to go into high tea this beautiful like great olive color and putting that right on top and then I'm just blending everything out for my inner corner highlight I'm using shimma shimma on a pencil brush and then I want my lower lashes to be like very volumizing so i'm using the clinic bottom lash mascara because i feel like it gives my lower lashes a lot of volume and then for my top lashes i just threw on some L'Oreal telescopic and that completes my eye look a lot of people complain that I don't wear falsies enough but I just don't wear them all the time it's not very practical for me i don't know i just don't wear it a lot but wear them a lot anyway I'm just warming up my skin before i go ahead and contour using the NYC son and bronze in Montauk bronze and then i'm going to contour my face this is the Kevin quan sculpting powder in medium and then contouring with a more fiemme 510 brush i love this brush to contour with because it doesn't give you like a super harsh you know nars a brush no of contour it's a little bit fluffier for blush I'm using makeup geek spellbound and i'm using the same brush I use the bronze my face with and that is the real techniques multitask brush for the highlights i am using the buddy no they mary-lou manizer by the bomb this is the morphe em 501 brush you were wondering so you have some just highlighting you know like I usually do and then finish off this look I'm adding my lipstick i wanted something very very very pale nude but you can do whatever you want this is Cairo it is a NYX soft matte lip cream and i'm just applying that to my lips as you can see it's very very light super pale you can put like a lip gloss on top or use an eyeliner and eyeliner lip liner under instead anyway that completes this look thank you guys so much for watching please subscribe if you haven't already and I will see you in my next video bye hey

I look like a damn making more out with his face on right now yeah i'm going to start clean slate poreless primer this is just my silicone e feeling primer for people to have liked more porous skin hello me how you doing my name is Manny and I of course problematic starting in the center just kind of blending outwards so for foundation I'm gonna be going in with the new Iranian force of the sea foundation retard obviously the heart one brand tutorial i got this recently when I was in hawaii was hard and they just launched a huge array of products and the rainforest foundation was one of them this is such a beautiful foundation I've worn it twice so far the only thing about it i don't really like is that I feel like I have to use a lot of foundation and to get to the coverage that I want because this is more of a baby I feel like a natural to medium coverage foundation maybe that's just me I'm in the shade light medium and natural I'm gonna start pressing in with the Beauty Blender all over my skin it does give you the most beautiful skin like appearance of for foundation a very glowing and natural-looking which is beautiful i love it even when I pile on a shit ton of foundation is still looks really beautiful really natural which I like I just like to have to use like to hold syringes of product to get like the coverage i want you know but then again i am a bully and I want to cover a lot that was one syringe and only covered up like this area of mine and I need one more syringe to do with the forehead and the nose maybe you guys don't have to but I do if your oil you want to go with more of a mattifying product underneath and set it with powder because it is going to be pretty glowy as you can see it does give a beautiful amount of coverage once you later it on look super super pretty very glowy very natural looking overall this is a beautiful a foundation that gets truly stunning I'm gonna go in with the tart I was going to clean water proof 12-hour concealer i really like this one - I want to use consider many times before which is a really nice full coverage stick concealer like you can see freaking full ask coverage is insanity I'm gonna use too much because this is a very very heavy weight and dense concealer reminds me of like the seven o'clock concealer like it's that and and full ask sick coverage concealer I'm in the shade fairlight like to highlight with them as well and i'm going to put in areas i need more coverage as well ok perfect and now we're going to go in and blend that out with the same and beauty bar that we just went in with for the face full ask coverage concealer i really do like this one a lot ya see that give me your grace that is what you should have so far as nice just blend it out highlighted and shit concealer and foundation on there's a lot of powder let me go with a smooth operator and which is like they're translucent powder to set the face with I'm gonna put that underneath the highest just really make sure that everything is set in place underneath the eye because again this is a very creamy concealer you want to make sure that it is it will begin to increase on you i can already see some of it wanted to crease and I'm like no bitch not today so just kind of going with a little bit of the smooth operator just a very much small amount because this is a white translucent powder and we don't want any crazy kind of flashback you know what I mean you know what I mean I know you do you've seen those photos of celebrities and you're thinking damn bitch poor yo yeah and then I'm gonna take a huge brush this is the morphe 41 just a big fluffy brush and kind of big fluffy brush of work i'm just going to dip it in a little bit of what i have on the cap of the powder and I just gonna go everywhere all over my face again just a very light layer just to make sure that everything is set in place this is a setting powder I wanted to make sure everything is nicely set so now i'm going with the BB powder by hard this is one of the newest foundation powders that they just launched its a creamy powder foundation and it's a light-medium neutral that's a shame that we end up going in with haven't tried to see this is first time this little tab for me and let's make little 10 below 10 so we're going with that same big be 41 and 0 from the outside of the face and then go in from there so like the darkest color gets deposited on like the hollows of my face already this isn't the main colors the grumbler shit it's fine we'll live at the end of the world if your little more tan than you are suppose to be this powder is pretty the hook up to take that down the neck because I do want to match my next to my face so the skin is looking pretty nice i'm not gonna lie i feel like this video with garlic this one brand tutorial is also like a first impressions video because i haven't tried a lot of these products like not try it a lot of these things so bear with me so how's it going with the hardest contour kit just like the cute little round 1 this might have you and I really do love it I'm gonna take a key to brush my morphe you brought up the skin I'm gonna take this really warm bronzy color so like vanilla and chocolate so then what ever get to the bronzing part i want to talk to you guys this like the bronzing part is where I start to get a little like stir crazy and i wanna be like you guys like what you guys doing today cause you're a sweet going like what's going on you know what I mean I don't know what it is about the bronzer that makes me get stir crazy but it does it truly does this is like literally the point of like no return for me where I'm like hey guys what are we doing ok cool what leave me a comment like I'm so weird i don't know why i almost forgot to bronze up my right cheek ok man you just walk around fucking won bronze or cheap one cheek bronzer what and then I'm going with the makeup the contouring brush and take a little bit of the darkest shade in the contrary it's just a little bit of contouring not too much as you want to go a little bit not to him not too easy calm down why am I talking like this what this brush like to go in first and they do a nice layer down and then I'll start buffing up so there's no harsh lines between the bronzer and the contour I'm not going to let people do like the harsh line but i'm just going to blend the two together let them marinate haven't done a 12 total in so long you have to know it's been so fucking long way since I've done one brand in the last night it will take forever and that was like Ohio go dude it goes a while so I'm excited to be doing this so many people have been asking me to 21 and it's finally here there's a spot on the right side of my face it's right here and rejects all pigment like whenever I'm bronzing on my skin or contouring like a rejected like I have to go over it so many times to try to even get the slightest color payoff there it's the weirdest thing you guys have that like where there's a spot on your face on your skin that literally rejects pick me and it doesn't want to take any color it's the weirdest thing it's so fucking annoying is what it is I'm like bro let me fuckin put contour there on and then going back in i'm going to take this shade right here it's at the lightest shade that a couple of the tarbrush no brushes for bed sweetheart I'm gonna kind of just highlight underneath the contour just slightly nothing to him to give me a nice like straighter line contour cool so now we have the contour down we are good with the face of far now let's going with some blues I'm gonna take the tar blush in ecstatic which is a cute little baby want to get this like a holiday said I think I don't know it's like this it's like the cutest little color it's a very pretty peachy apricot color and us know apricot blushes are my shit taken out more p 3 it's a very bright it's really pretty look how pretty that is I look like a fucking goddess tart blushes are so freaking bomb you guys use those are blushes are some of the best places like ever tried they last so well on the skin to like oh my god visit with them so now i'm going to highlight the face with this bad bitch right here this is the new skin twinkle lighting palette they're launching their first had any kind of like how exciting is that who I love it this one is a really nice shimmery white gold and then this one over here on the far end is a really pretty pink champagne and the middle one is like more time at yellow and that's more like for the other I think I don't know I'm kind of confused by that when it feels kind of weird yeah I'm not the biggest fan of the middle one but the other two honest I are gorgeous like I'm actually obsessed I'm gonna take the more champagne color up here and start going in with my morphe and 5 10 favorite having brush never so cute so then so having the skin with it let's see how it looks yeah ok do you see this I know you can make sure the astronauts can yeah it's much more pink on my skin is always something that doesn't mean much more like champagne but it's much more pink so you guys are really into like the pinky highlighters watch out and be weird for this shade on this side but it's stunning it's still fucking gorge trying to get more to pinky highlighters and find a dive into the world a little bit but I think it looks to be pretty cool so we have to face done that is it for the face I want to keep it like this i think it's really freaking good so I'm gonna go ahead and start with the eyes now let's get his eyes so I had no idea that tart even didn't I primer or like brow products like whatsoever i dug through my room like hardcore looking at all my PR something I found some stuff to use some pretty stoked about it like I didn't feel it was not expecting that at all so I found this tart the brow architect by pencil and it looks like the new anastacio brow definer like I've had this for like a year so I mean guitar diverse to fucking know i'm going to the shade deep I've never tried this not even once i have no idea how this is gonna work I was going to run this through my brows I don't feel like this puts a lot of product down though is also might be too fucking life my brows you guys like to watch these videos because I don't know what I'm doing with products that I've never tried before haha it's like this me back up if you guys have tried any of the tart brow stuff let me know in the comments below what you do like from them might come to the brows but I haven't tried any of the brown stuff whatsoever I don't have more brow products but it's the only one I have personally so let me know in the comments because I've tried anything else that they might have okay so I'm gonna keep it at this some nice furry brow how's it look be honest with me okay it just looks really light cool that's going to prime the is now I have the tart clean slate 360 creases primer I've never tried this memory for it Larry first time ever for suppression let's see how goes it comes out like a little white kind of paste ok let's try it out how is he like sunscreen so for the bodies were going to go in with the tartlet in balloon pilot just like that easy natural part of the ice i'm not going to do anything intense with the shadow what I want to do is a really cool different kind of a liner instead so i'm going to go very natural on the eye for things were going to grab a morph ep14 the shade charmer charmers are very just white beige color and that's gonna go on the brow bone just to highlight the brow bone a little bit so now we're gonna do for the eyes and we're going to go in with a mixture of flower child and smarty pants a very light amount of those guys not on a e27 brush my morphe not just going to go into the crease because this look is solely focused on the liner but i do want to keep the crease a little more defined and whatnot so I think these colors mix will be really really really pretty perfect so now with Morsi and 433 minute take a little bit of sweetheart actually that was like a nice dusty rose color that's going to go on the outer corner push that in to the crease super nice just dusty rose ish color I love that dusty rose like oh just zeros anything obsessed and then i'm going to go in with a little bit of color rebel which is like a chocolaty Brown and that's just going to very very very outer corner just a very small tiny amount of it nothing too crazy and taking that you 27 just blending that into the crease a little bit as well as keeping it very concentrated out here in the outer corner though not taking it too far in and then going in with a t14 one more time I'm going to grab charmer again that the collector on the brow bone I'm gonna put on the lid light layer of that all over the lid to really brighten and awaken the eye so for the shadow part we are done we're good on the shadows we're going to keep it at that so now for the fun liner aspect of it i'm gonna be going in with the new clay pot in mint gonna take that on a nice little tart brush and I'm going with this nice mint jelly laning yeah yeah I'm just gonna fill it in from there it looks so pretty i love it i think it's so cute like I'm obsessed why do you look a little bit of black underneath it like make it look more sharp and defined on the outer corner I just got the new so fine liner it's literally like the skinniest even see like you need to you can you can you see how small this tip is look at my I compared to it you're just like a little bit of black underneath it to make it look more sharp and defined yeah okay doing it bucket that way yeah like let's go play some mascara i might be taking in the lights camera lashes the purple one from Tarte why don't you think from Tarte I don't know who's going to apply a layer of that on my lashes I'm gonna be wearing falsies anyway taking the new bounce some serengeti lashes I'm going to be applying those bad boys on the eyes today they're not to think of a band but they still give me a nice definition which I love so we're going to the bottom lash line now just a little bit nothing to him by taking e 36 brush and a little bit of smarty pants on the outer corner of my Laura lifeline just give me a little bit of definition on the lower

cosmetics case shadow palette in the burgundy shade the burgundy palette AKA i was so ecstatic when I realized that this was sent to me i know no idea I was gonna get your package with the burgundy palette and the new lipsticks i was actually little shocked because I didn't order them they were just sent to where I get my products into and I was like how did this even get here no idea what I still to this day i never got an email from cali cosmetics or anything it will just have to my house and honestly I'm not complaining at all that is fucking cool but yes even though the product was sent to me the pilot was sent to me i'm not going to like say oh my god it was so amazing because we sent to me know that's not how I work that's just not what it is at all i like the pie like if I don't make don't and that's just what it is there's nothing wrong with having a different opinion opinions are like assholes everyone has one not all of them are pretty big fucking real but yeah as always if you guys like this video if you guys don't like me please don't fucking watching you know the drill with that I say in every single video you know the fucking drill by now come on but because you liked this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe if you aren't already subscribed to my channel and if you're new what's up and many anyway and thank you so much for being here whatever you are gonna be powered by cosmetics so it comes in a really really cool packaging like I did last time this is the cute little box the chi shadow pressed powder eyeshadow palette as you can see this is a rose gold finish on the outer packaging this time and then this one is named aspect to the last palette as well except this one is more of a rose tone that drips to it which is absolutely stunning and i love it just like last time I love the packaging that was so innovative and so-called some unique i love actually differentiated this palette with the last one by doing the different-colored oil drips to open up the palate same thing exact same component as the last county Palatine shades no mirror in the palette I wish it did have it this retails for $42 and we'll let you guys know whether or not i think this call is worth the price or not don't have done is worth it ok first shade first this is the shade and naked watching my finger it's very very very soft and lightweight and watch it with my hand to see that so basically it's a very very lightweight shimmer this is actually not my favorite shade in the entire Bunch actually it's actually my least favorite shade in the entire budget it's a very just lightweight tan shimmer color it's not like shimmery words like BAM shimmer it's like a light subtle like Sheen to the look at some everything but i believe that she did create the shadow in mind of people that wanted a very lightweight like light shadow on the lid which totally makes sense for me personally I just know I'll never use it so it's like it's annoying to me but it is a beautiful color it's just not my cup of tea cool equals the next shadow is going to be the shade a beach which is beautiful orangi tan brown shade right here just watching my hands feel it always feels fucking good just watching my finger right here beautiful it is BU to fall oh my gosh I really like the shape so much as no patchiness in this for me there's no passion as you can see that you can see there's no streaks in my hand it's a straight-up swatch no streaks it is in my crease and they looked great it blended fantastically so i really have no complaints is a very nice burnt orange tan color and that is a win for me guys ago that is a go next sheet is the shade at penny and this is a very rustic orange shade so so pretty to go right into orange watch over here come on so pigmented on my goodness the shadows are extremely smooth extremely soft i feel like the mats and this one are better than the maps in the last palette because again they are smoother softer they have less kick back and I really really like that this shade penny is a win for me is also in my crease right now it's like the orange shade you guys see my crease i love a nice rusty orange red tone that matter i love that next we have this shade LA which is this really pretty copper bronze shade is watch it this one feels so fucking good look at this look at this fucking shade this is a boiled finish what you guys know I'm screaming 400 bog look up that is a beautiful color is actually the color I'm going on my later right now i use it with a brush I didn't use of my fingers and it was it's this pigmented so I'm very very very much impressed that is my shit i love that shapes so so much so far the only clothes that i do not like is naked that's one of the four every other color is so far has been a go so next is the shade burgundy which is a very pretty pink it's actually literally like a pink a raspberry icee beautiful beautiful raspberry pink shade it's not bringing me whatsoever it's like a pink raspberry I really feel like highly picked it up in this formula impressed even fucking brain so that shade of Burgundy is another go it's absolutely beautiful it feels very very creamy and it doesn't pick up our like the other shades work so i definitely do think that this palette is already so much better than the last palette the last one I did like I just don't think was worth the money but so far this one is actually worth the money to me so we just watched five of the shadow so let's see the other four and see how they play out so now here is the shade do by filling it with my finger another beautiful foiled feeling fucking gorgeousness what it looks like i'll say the shades like a very pretty foiled rose shade as again a little bit of pink reflect a little bit of gold reflect so it's like a rose gold but much more rows than gold so I would say another banger is a beautiful shade i really wanted to put this on all over my lid but the golden was really just speaking to me so I don't you fucking call you know I was like the shimmers in this palette so much more so much more than the last guy like these tumors are actually like shimmering and intense other ones weren't as intense for me and I love of intense bold reflection next she is a shade of brick and this is another match shade this is a really pretty red in around this is much more brown though this might be a Swiss chocolate by Mac I'm just watch it right next to Dubai as the fucking horrible swag me try the king and try that again so what she looks like right here it's a very pretty red and brown again very similar to Mac swiss chocolate it's literally like the same fucking guard me it's hilarious actually on the outer corner of my eyes today to blend in with that really pretty penny shade it just looks so so nice and I like the blends so well the shadows here the mats are much softer than the last one which I feel is odd because you when it's softer there's more kick back but there's less came back in this palette that was last one I don't know I don't you did it it's like about next to the shade of New York and this is a what is this feeling it feels like a fucking just talking blue just focus group that's going to watch right yeah I can see that right there beautiful this is a true Toby bronze shade much more foiled the other politicians it's not as intense training and other colors are but it is another beautiful shade it's a really pretty deep bronze gold unless you have to hold gold so pretty another banger though I do think this is a really pretty color I want to put this all over my lid as well but i only have one leg I can't put that many colors I mean isn't New York is another go I don't know I'm saying that's ago but that's just my thing today and last but not least this is the shade almond and this is a really pretty dark dark dark very plush brownie reminds me a lot of Aphrodite from my palette on this beautiful deepened Flemish brown so pretty only very very very soft lightweight matte shade it's not intense by any means it doesn't feel bad and feel gross it's a very soft feeling which i really really enjoy it when it is almond and braker actually really really similar the only off by a couple of tones like they're very very very racist comment on the outer corner of my eye to deepen everything I don't have any black are different shadows on my crease or anything like that to make it a deep it was just using almond and it really did work to make it look nice and dark and intense and a lot of depth to look so again almond is another banger I think that turn out beautifully and this is the final look using the Kylie cosmetics burgundy palette obviously i'm wearing lashes right now and have liner on and add a little bit of highlight the inner corner and to the brow bone because the shadow naked in this palette is not my favorite the lashes i'm wearing actually enjoy this video Miami by lily lashes because you're curious why lashes i'm wearing Lily lashes may I mean you can use the code many ways to have somebody interested in it I just like this pair a lot of very wispy intense and they're so glam so again all in all this palette retails for $42 do I think it's worth the price i do this is actually a good how I really do like this one and I know I actually be using this a lot more often that i was going to use the other palette the only shot i don't like is the shade naked and that's just not my cup of tea I don't like shaped like that i don't like a very soft like almost not there shimmer I want either matter i want intense shine I don't want anything between that's just my personal preference though but i do think that this palette is actually worth the 42 bucks unlike last time I didn't think it was worth it but this one I think is looking at just so it's so pretty these are kinda tones i love these are so beautiful to me this is like my fucking bread-and-butter this i write out on my bread-and-butter as I can remember I do think it is worth the price and i would buy this personally I was gonna buy it just so happened to be sent to me so I'm impressed with this pilot much more than I am impressed with the last one I feel like she picked it up and it's just better just what it is it's better it's actually worth the price is time and the other one is ending was so that's my honest a pain and you guys that is it for the entire video i hope you guys enjoyed watching today's video of this kindly cosmetics burgundy palette shadow review i

for ever and make up for ever one not by a lot of it was like all over the place honestly everyone wanted everything ever wanted to see tarmac and make up for ever's makeup ever took it by like a very tiny amount of my whole entire faces make your favorite besides the browser the browser using a random brow gel because i couldn't find anything for me a favor for the brows and I didn't want to use the Aqua steel I want to go off leak issue with the brow you know everything other than the browser's make if ever I am so excited to be doing this series I'm going to be doing more of my promise you

this look if you guys like this video if you guys don't like me please don't like it why did you know that you like that but if you guys do like this video and you guys do like me please like this video like a little bit just like right down there is a little like one right here is a little thumb click it and comment if you guys liked it as well I would really appreciate that yeah without further ado let's go ahead and get started on this one brand look I make a fabric hey guys okay cool so it's going to start this bad boy off I'm 15 had to be filming this video and she wasn't so long ago but you know what that are like the numbers when I only thing ok so it's going to start with the face of course my face is completely barely a moisturizer on and i'm gonna go ahead and start with primer for today I'm going to using the step 1 equalizers I think they are such amazing primers for the face i think they're freakishly bomb I'm gonna take the step 1 Glaser in smoothing and I'm gonna go in my t-zone this is such a great smoothing primer a type of the appearance of pores like stupid bomb I'm just on my nose and just go with one finger and like press it around and you are pores are big ass back and pulls of death that's what right ok and then we're going to take the hydrating one for the perimeter of my face but I feel like it helps my face like look less cracking less cakey so i put this on spots i have got more fine lines and wrinkles like this area right here is a smile too much the equal wages from AFF are meant to be used together with fellow equalizers so it's totally fine if you mix them together because it's going to totally work out in your favor trust a bitch cuz mama knows ok oh he's a profound you should i'm going to take me make a favor Ultra HD foundation is a new one they just launched and i'm going to shade 140 equals y 305 make a favor numbering is not my favorite because i think it's really confusing gonna take two pumps on the back of my hand a lofty popli is making two and a half okay i'm gonna take a Beauty Blender i was going to press out all over the skin I just started on my cheeks because that's what I like the most horse again and I like to fill up my pores with some foundation is a good for your skin problem not probably fucking not I think the coverage is better than the old one I think this one also lasts longer on the face in the old HD still make up for ever get done did good on camera wasn't freaking filming but what i did was i did an excessive step you don't need to this whatsoever i took the Makeup Forever HD stick it's more of a full coverage foundation stick and i put this on my cheeks this is going to give you more coverage this is a full coverage stick that gives you like really glowy like satin finish and we're gonna put in the t-zone the kind of highlight the face a little bit and then blend it out with the Beauty Blender you feel it blends out like so freakishly bomb is stupid again that step was not necessary but you know might have how to do it because Mama's extra a month extra now i'm gonna take some concealer I'm gonna take the full cover creme and shake number three this is like to have to make up for ever's though this was going to use and i'm going to use that with the beauty blender because this bitch is folk over to the but uh huh i'm going to press that in underneath the eye it's so pretty though oh my gosh i'm going to highlight with this - but use it very sparingly you don't need so much of it so don't like use a lot of if you don't need a lot of it take my beauty blender and blend out so you can also pick up the excess product because it is a full-coverage concealer and it's a cream so you don't want to work with it and you want to set it off so quickly I'm gonna take this eyeshadow makeup forever it's this one right here I really know the name of it i mean it on the back but it's kind of a bitch to find so I'm just going to leave it in the description box down below as an eyeshadow but it's kind of a yellow base i'm gonna use that to set my under eye me might as well you know what the powder to fuck about her feel that I shadows are so ridiculously nice spicy no rules to it you know anything . a little thing look makeup every little dated for me please tell me that you super cool PR think manatees were sold separately like us could buy these other things like your favorite influencers faces on them not be so freaking cool i don't know i think that's such a cool thing and I think it's so cool and makeup ever sent these out to people I'm so honored to have been sent one I think maybe forever is amazing forever if you want to have a collab great so we are now concealed and we have found each night and we are good to go now i want to go and set my face i'm going to make up for ever HD high definition powder this is the loose when I wish I had the pressed one but i don't but I'm gonna take a little bit on the back of the cap and take that with a more fiji 0 my holy grail powder brush just it's so good because you see pricing bubble bubble toil and trouble don't want to put too much fun because it's going to give you think that white flash back because it is a silica powder to have to be really conscious of that but just going to start pressing over the face with the HD powder hook I think that HD powder looks so pretty I'm going to take the maker pro finishing powder and 1 18 and I'm going to do on my neck just to kind of match my neck little bit better to my face this powder is just like a foundation powder and it's actually really really nice i use on my face sometimes too it's going to run that on my neck just down my neck a little bit on my ears and yeah that's all I got ok cool so now i'm going to bronze up the thing i'm going to make it forever map bronze powder and shade 20 I talked about this before my channel for I think it's such an amazing amazing amazing bronzer and take down the morphe to come to run that in my bronze and areas it's not too warm to cool I think it's so beautiful and I like that it's very buildable this is such a buildable bronzer it's not like so happy or anything like that I just think it's so nice little bit on my chin a little bit down my fucking chin what is this on my chin yeah bitchin ja raha otherwise fucking job oh my god ax alright cool so we have some chronic like we have some nice dimension to the skin that the bronze look so freaking pretty interesting the bronze look so gorgeous so not for blush I'm gonna take the sculpting brush in the shade tents like a very nice pastel e pink color I'm going to just a little bit of online no not a light blush sleeping it's such a really pretty like fleshy kind of pink it's like so like you know don't know what that noise was but that's what I'm feeling perfect we are blushed I thought I want to write something about my start getting more like diva as you know like a lot of people have been noticing my videos like i'll be like in boy mode I'm like super like you guys that like doesn't like super children as soon as I start getting laid the foundation on associate the highlighter on like a bitch hey Carl what kind of thing you know so now for the house later I'm gonna be taking the pro sculpting 20 in the shade number two which um hi obsession with the on a morphine m510 brush just to highlight the skin I'm taking that gold color to highlight oh I'm just gonna go in I love this highlighter so much Joe how good it is a joke why don't you just more i forgot i don't you just enough okay great perfect so the face is basically done this is what it looks like the face is complete let's go and start getting into the eyes now okay so basically i saw and i did a look I did like almost the whole entire I look already but I hated it so much like my liner looks so fucking shitty that I took it all off and reapply concealer and everything so if you guys see like anything like cracking in my concealer it's because i like it off like this whole area already and i just replied so hopefully doesn't look too bad but I'm doing this again Alex look with shitty haven't seen me to all the time ok so whatever do now for that I love already primed my eyes and I already did my eyebrows off camera using the concealer and I used to that shadow that one shadow and I pressed it over it as well as the browse the brows I didn't have anything for making february's for the brow so just like you know what we just do them off camera because I didn't have anything from them I wanted like a little bit of browser but they have the Aqua seal and I didn't really want to use the questions that i want to go to flee so I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna take the e 27 my morphe and I running in my bronzer and i'm going to be using that as my transition shade know honestly like how i feel about bronze I just feel like they're big ass eyeshadows you can use bronzer as much as you want honestly as a shadow there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever I'm gonna run into my crease and your I should look something like this is a nice just diffused crease I went well sony oh I'm gonna go and take this beautiful cranberry shade right here trying Morello I think of everything everything on this morphine for three and very small amount of it i want to go to jam with this color because you can look real pink real quick okay I honestly love this color so much so it's like stupid how much I love it beautiful as soon as I saw it I was like I mean he's that just feather it forward towards the front of the eye i'm just being very light hand with I'm not taking too much most of it is deposited on the outer corner you're seeing this shade is so freaking beautiful it's stupid so I think that you 27 again and just blend out that color I'm going to be going in with this gorgeous palette for making favorites like the number one pallet and i'll take that middle shade is like a really beautiful like taupe color and I'm cheating on my finger I'm gonna play sat on my lady it's so step knee and then I grab the darker one right here with my finger again and just put it on the outer corner like just very slightly well just for some dimension on the lid still just a more dimension and then that same for 3 i'm just going to blend out the edges a little bit more and then with that same power I'm gonna take a little bit of the black on the import 33 and then just place it on the outer corner only just for some more dimension again all this looks to be nice and blended very well you have a little bit of that pink like cranberry shades shining through not too much but i like it and then taking that you 27 again and blending out the edges taking that same banana in shade right here I'm gonna toss them out on the brow bone again just kind of clean up what I kind of messed up and with like the blending and whatnot highlight all over again you know on a more fee and 422 letting it downwards and the eyes top of the actual something like this I really like how this one turned out much better than the last one sheet damn shit okay great so now the tops of the thighs are done i think it came out way better than the other i did like oh my gosh you actually saw if you guys follow me on snapchat you guys saw it i bet you guys are like buff huh it was not you whatsoever so let me just go and finish the bottom of the high now I'm gonna take that same map browser I think if ever any e36 pencil brush my morphe I'm just gonna run underneath that I you need me to meet with is just going to be our transition I'll see we're not going to do very much to the bottom lash line because I wanted to be just focus on the top of the time or I'm gonna go back in with the artists palette I'm to take this shade down here one that we put on the outer corner of all right I'm going to place that on the outer corner of my lower lash line with that same 36-pound like i'll give you that chance like dimension but it has like a really cool sheen to it as well and then just kind of feather that forward justin is really pretty coppery Brown shooting now with the same 36 brush just kind of dust the bitch off on a little drugged or something on your pants whatever take this icy shade right here and I'll put that on the inner corner of my eye as my inner corner highlight kids has like a pinky tone to it what the fuck and you know that that's cool okay great so I have curled my lashes already off camera just because it's curling your lashes you know you are you know how to do that so I'm going to be smoky shop again and just put some of that on my lashes I've never actually tried this mascara before but let's let's hope someone has to pay my mom loves it she lets you

excited about like putting my lashes on mascara so I like put myself all the fucking time mmm difference I like it I like it ok but honestly I'm like really liking the smoking shopping and mascara

moment and my moment I mean last three months the new bounce some lashes Bella minx they are the most beautiful life Larry intense lashes they are more in the dramatic sites we got to be like cautious of that any event like that I go to for anything or just like tutorials here and there they are on the lashes are wearing that's what one of them looks like that difference oh my gosh i love this last so much it's going to cost the other bitch I I'm which means Ryan or not at the time i won't even wear eyeliner with these lashes because it's such a nice black dark band I feel like it gives me definition already and I don't even need to wear eyeliner at all yes the lashes are on their fully key I'm going to begin to see what they look like close the eyes are done what you guys think so now I lips I'm almost done with the look I'm going to the lips now i'm going to be taking the lip liner in to see which is like one of my favorite lip liners for them i think the players are beautiful and they last forever on the lid they're so creamy i love them to have these bitches glide on like fucking butter I'm not getting guys to make a federal partners are one of the nicest the players I've ever felt like on the lips they literally feel like butter fill the whole damn live in and then for the lipstick i decided i'm going to go in with the new today because you know the last look I did I had more of a bold lip and I want to go with more - 28 this time I'm gonna take the artist intense number 22 it's a very very light lift look I mean nude but it's a very light nude like a very light

if you're interested in the palette will be linked down below and yeah it's going to get into this video yeah ok so we are back with another man you anyway palette tutorial so excited about these well guys I just really really excited to be filming these so we're gonna do as many as we possibly can when we can so I have an idea in my head of what I've done it too so it's going to make that happen just go right into it works and jump right into the tutorial hop on in we are going to gray of beaches and cream on a more for me 27 brushes just going to go everywhere that I wasn't what i want to do a dramatic liner so I want the lid and the crease to be really really soft and not so intense a little bit on the lid whatever you just have left on the lid i'm already primed by the way I have a primer on and so don't even worry about it if you're thinking manual what are you doing bitch almost primed perfect what we have so far it's not very easy basically looks like nothing is on your lid crease so we're gonna be more p.m. for 33 brush and a frappe was not very nice maple brown color and I couldn't go very slightly into the crease not a lot though the reason I'm putting frappe into the crease because i want to give a little bit of dimension to the crease not that much and I want to keep on the outer corner specifically just super chill and not too much and then e 7 and blending that out a little bit just cause I want it to be too hard I just want a little bit of dimension in the crease and that is about it so this is what you preach it look like very easy and nothing to him just a little bit of color in the outer corner and then we're going with the fun part we're going to be grabbing Mars of course that's my red shadow and then the palate and then you got any language that you have i'm going to be taking it the more feet and 51 whoa what are you going to be taking the more p.m. 58 which that's a nice liner brush is what it looks like it's really really good it's very small defined and i'm just going to pack that onto the eyeliner as if it's as if it's a gel liner pretend that the shadows gel liner and that's all we're going to do a zoom in a little bit more so you guys can see a little bit closer be careful with dipping into march because it is such a pigmented a shadow like I'm not kidding it's fucking crazy and we're going to act on it as our liner yeah ok and now we're going to make a little wing with it is whale just kind of sketch it out first the wing is gonna be intense because this is the main portion of this entire looks so don't be afraid to make it like a la boum wing did you know i am afraid you didn't know if you get too freaked out about doing this you can always use tape and tape is a really good method to use when doing this you can just pound on a bunch of shadow and have like the tape make the wing short but i'm just gonna use a little bit concealer to clean up after anyway so don't worry about it if you think it's like a little intense for you you can do it I promise luckily the shadow is so fucking pic with you that I can just glide it like as if it's an eyeliner see that shit to use even looks so sick ok next time then okay great so we have both of the eyes done at the top at least so this might be taking manual you have a little bit more color in your crease then what we remember while a bitch fuck step ok so what happened with I was curling my lashes on camera and I was calling really close to the lash like the lash line of course and like I stopped calling and then i went i moved upwards to curl like again and then some of the part on the top of this transferred to my lid the red and I'm like okay so i had to just going to work with some of the right in the crease is kind of blend it out I think it looks totally cool i love it i think it looks awesome I am not mad at the mistake you know sometimes mistakes are really cool but you want to keep it like dark brown just keep the five pain there be careful with the left with this because it will transfer apparently so - be careful with it but if you don't mind a little bit of pink in the crease I don't at all I looking so whatever type on house of lashes iconix on the eyes I'm starting to really like these lashes a lot like I've been wearing a lot more recently and I think they look really really really pretty special with this look when I'm just doing a liner basically the whole look so yeah I like it okay great so it's going to want to the bottom lash line I already did the mascara knowledge it off camera the we're going to grab Knicks cocoa eyeliner eyeliner and lip liner pencil course we're going to use cocoa lip liner and I'm going to the waterline this color is so freaking pretty it's like a red into Brown will take a little bit on the lashes as well and then just grab any pencil dress I'm grabbing the e36 buy morphine just kind of blending that out a little bit before it completely dries I'm gonna grab a little bit of Sora on that same 36 and blend that out a little bit just to give me some nice warm like cocoa color back I'm gonna grab a more feet 40 3 and take Aphrodite which is the dark plum not gonna go too close to the lash line just give me a really good amount of definition and dimension just make sure it's a lot darker by the lash line and then once you pack on with that color go ahead and blend out with the e36 again just to make sure there's no harsh edges as I was blending away my lower lash line I decided you know what i want to do a darker in a rim not really i'm not really feeling the like reddish brown i'm going with more of a true brown i'm going to mr. right now by the bomb in the shade bill a bill I don't feel like it's a little bit too right on the water line you know I don't look like I have a disease not feeling that look right now so we should go in with that right now I'm just not very lightly go over the color already have down just make a little more chocolaty and not has read and I'm feeling a lot more I am feeling that a lot more and that is the final I like this one looks like this is going to turn out to be i absolutely love it such an easy look you guys want you can always highlight the inner corner of your eye as well should we do it I think we should come on I'm gonna take the morphe am3 26 and Artemis and just apply a little bit to the inner corner it was a little puppets on a son named and now we're calling it a day ok let me get in to see what the hide looks like up close yeah and that is it for the entire tutorial i hope you guys like this video I had so much fun playing this for you guys I am so into doing looks right now with my palate obviously it just came out so I'm just beyond happy and excited and i hope everyone is liking the palate trying to create as many looks with my palate as possible if you guys have any suggestions we using any different shades you guys want to see let me know in the comments box below and I will totally left to film a tutorial with whatever shade whatever look you're going for I'm just let me know and it's not a problem I would love to do it but other than that of course at night or day where you guys are I'll catch you guys in my next video holy tutorial with my palate again yeah i'll talk to you soon bye hey guys welcome back to my channel today's video is a video on this cool badass sunset e-type I have going on right now I wanted to do something different i think i haven't played with like yellows and purples in a while and I wanted to incorporate that in today's look I hope you guys enjoy your scene because that's what this video is I've been getting tons of requests to do more different dramatic colorful looks and i know this is not think the most dramatic look at that most colorful look but i think it turned out really really cool and I feel like it's it is a very wearable sunset I and because we are getting more into spring and summer I wanted to go with some spring summer e-type looks do you guys feel me I think it's been so long since they filmed it really has a bit like I'm just be filming right now I'm going out of town I'm going out of town I don't know where this is going to have no idea I'm just pretty filling in for you guys to have a video I'm going to be going to New York la vegas it's just in the next two weeks it to me crazy Drac on I'm so excited to be such a fun next two weeks but I am a pre filming right now for those trips and this is what it looks like him up with but yeah I'm stop rambling so i feel like i rambled like you fucking crazy but yeah without further ado it's going to get into this video as always if you like this video if you guys like me please don't fucking water you know the deal with that but it did you like this video and you guys do like me and you get to my channel please like this video and subscribe to my channel if you aren't already and if you knew what's up I'm anyway and it's my child and let's go and get into this really cool sunset e-type I so it's going to get into this video I already did my face basically I was like you know what I'm doing my face a little blah lately and just switch it up a little bit and have one of the new more college I really want to use today so I'm like let me incorporate that somehow in today's videos that's kind of what I'm doing today just for reference already pie my lids and I have my eyebrows done already so that we're just going to go in with shadow solely i'm so excited using this palette i'm so stoked i literally just got it today and I cannot handle like a happy today it's this bad boy 0 50 in all mad are you joking I'm so excited to be using this I'm gonna go in with this shade right here it's a nice like to come mustard the orange to master any orange honey morphy 7 and we're gonna run out into the crease as a nice transition shade for the rest of the shades that we're going to be going anyway shit is peg mented right away on my gun I'm taking that all the way into inner corner and I'm doing windshield wiper motions as well as circular motions towards the end or have a little bit extra skin to work with out here this is a transition color so again you don't need me to like meet with it whatsoever once we have that nice mustard yellow orange shade down I'm gonna be taking a new make a deep shadow called the tux in son it's just a nice like just like a nice corally pink shade which i think will go so nice with my idea of what I want this look to be um I'm going with the morphine and 43 and just blend that into the crease basically right on top of that morphine shadow just to give it some more dimension last time i'm going slightly lower than I have that orange shade but still like basically on top of it just to give it another added dimension to look and if you feel like you're going to hand with the tux and sun or whatever color you using i'll just go back in with that burnt orange shade from morphe on the same brush and blend up those edges to make sure that we do have a nice gradient and blend and you should have something like this now the tux and son is now a little bit lower and you can see there's a nice like orangie pinky gradients coming on and I'm digging it I'm thinking okay so now i think i'm gonna go in with this really cool darker burnt orange shade down here and that same morphe 35o palette and she just looks really nice like a burnt dark pinky-orange i'm judith on the same am or PM 433 brush and we're going to put that into the crease on the more outer corner and I can go as far in I just want to keep it on the outer corner mostly to make sure there's a nice gradient with this look I know I want to go with the shower because it's super nice pretty dark orange pink shade as you can see he's having a little bit more dimension to it is giving it more like a Firebird kind of feeling you know I'm keeping that lower than the rest of the colors between every single step just go back in and playing with a t27 to make sure there's no harsh lines or edges so what you continue to blend you have something like this so far so now we're going to take this shape make it was a brand new one from them is called fashion addict which is a nice just purple like a light lavender purple shade on a morphine 36 and go on the outer corner of my eye so we can have some more dimension and depth to this look I wanted to be like a really cool like sunset I like i was saying we're gonna have purple out here give it a different look we're actually going to combine that with taboo also by making because i feel like this color it's not dark enough and i want to a little bit darker purple I'm gonna go about two-thirds in keeping this area is completely bare because that's a br lid shade and you have something like this so far not going to do that I the great so that's what you look like now once you have everything blended out so now for the lip color i decided i'm going with a new shadow by mikey called Sin City and it's just a nice just boring g gold and all I can't really explain it as like an orange gold shade on a morphine am - 10 I just found out about this brush I just been using a non-stop so I'm going to load up the brush I'm going to look at the shadow but the brush and I'm going to pack up on all over the lid it's a really pretty orange e-gold I thought would go so nicely with this look I feel very festive I feel like a toucan awesome she should have something like this now what is all blended out so now we're going with the bottom lash line you see I kind of finish off with the top but right now i'm going to the bottom lashes I feel like it was just much easier together and have the shadows out so why not you know so I'm going to do is go back in with the Tuscan Sun shadow one more time on the e36 and start taking that out here and basically doing what i did on the top on the bottom lash line and literally just combining the two I would take it pretty far into the inner corner I want to look like the blend never stopped just can't just always just go up together you know so now we go back in with the fashion addict shadow on a morphine be 43 and that's going to go on an outer owner and we're going to make sure that we just bring out the nice purple tone back to it same thing and then going back in with taboo again a nice dark purple plum shade I'm going to do the exact same thing with the e 43 and make sure that the bottom of the lash line does the exact same thing at the top just kind of feathering it all together making sure that's all seamless and blended easily that's only going about halfway in rather than the entire weigh-in because i want to keep all the drama and exaggeration out here on the outer corner and I bring it too far in then blend out those edges to make sure there's no harsh lines and then take a little mac , graphic pencil a memorable line of the waterline with that now carlashes and put some mascara on and once you get the eyelashes on as well this is the final I love you and by the way the lashes I'm weighing our Russian black by new bounce some really cool - because they are very dense on the outer corner and fade in and go a little bit more sparse as you're going in so it's a really nice outer corner lash which is what i was going for with this look and I put a little bit of the most lightest color from the 3500 matte palette on the inner corner it's like a matte white highlight just I just wanted to add that just give it more brightness to look and that is it for today's video i hope you guys enjoyed this I look I know I didn't do a full face in this one because I was trying to save some time and film another video right after this so i can have more videos for you

times so basically this video is going to be another one of my installment of my one brand makeup tutorials the one that I did on nick's cosmetics because I no idea what I'm talking about I'll leave a link down below i'm starting a new series on my channel about doing one brand tutorial and this is my second installment of it using all benefit cosmetics which I am so excited to be using is over it's a 44 year and I would go to benefit for things all the time i used to go to benefit for everything and I love benefit products this is gonna be a lot easier to do because it's like i used to use that for all the times I never really use the Knicks like in the tutorial you guys saw like I was like not liking some try to find anything like it you know but this tutorial i have used better products i love benefit products I knew that wasn't like it already so I'm just like treading in some good water and on land yeah so this is going to be much more on the natural side much more glory much more use for much more just like pretty everyday how to make up I've been getting tons of requests to do more of a natural makeup look is much more natural than what i do you guys want to see how I achieve this more natural glow a pretty everyday look like I'm watching if you guys don't like it I'm screaming at you clearly other than that I'll get back to the tutorial I'll see you later bye everyone ok cool so we're going to start with our face completely clean and washed just going to the shower right now I went ahead and trimmed my beard and shaved coming or going from all that natural um if you're a girl which ninety-two percent of you are you don't you save your hey but if you're not you're a boy like me you don't shave it either . wife first and we're going to with is the Porefessional primer you guys have seen this on my channel already I love this primer for me specifically because I have more oily combination skin and this primer is amazing for people that are more oily combination and have really porous pores which I do I'm just concentrating them most of the product in the center of the things and blending our work with my fingers I don't need too much of this product is needed towards the center because I get oil in the t-zone and have normals Barkley ours and the t-zone is not the time mom is not the time I love this primary personally if you're more on the dry side out of here gonna like it that much because I mean its memory with a more oily and have really problematic pores so if you are dry and you have nice skin they don't have big pores it's not the primer for you listings now i'm gonna go ahead and go in with the hello flawless foundation since you're going for more of a natural look I'm just going to pump up of it on the back of my head actually make that two clones can make that one make that one that's too much this color I'm using his pedal so let's hope that's Michael it's like the second two lightest what's going on with the Beauty Blender and having it on I'm gonna go and start the center of the face and blend outwards that will give us the most natural finish I feel you're just going to concentrate more of the product and the T zone where you most need coverage and then you should kind of blend out the rest of the product outwards I'll i love this foundation like this foundation because it's lightweight but it gives you a nice amount of coverage you know it's like a nice medium to full coverage I think maybe two letters too wet oh my god it's like taking off the product that I'm putting down because it's so wet bitch apply a little bit down the neck as well perfect now we are a foundation down so we're going with a number one erase paste by benefit I i love the erase paste good thing with the race paste that you need a very tiny amount of it that you need like nothing trust me like a little bit goes along with this product reviews are clients all the time that's a flora and they would actually love but you have to teach them how to use it this is one of the product because it's so thick and creamy you really need a blended out and said with the powder or it's going to be too heavy i'm using a Beauty Blender just kind of blend it out just to kind of mask my my blue circles you know that is like a nice salmon undertone to it so really helps cancel out the blue hues and i'm not going for a really dramatic highlighted look I'm just really covering up the dark circles I'm just putting in the inner corner I really just pressing it in with the Beauty Blender I think works so freaking good I counseling out like any like darkness I absolutely love this stuff but again you have to use a very sparingly if you just use a little bit blend it out if you want more a little more ok trust me trust the bitch cuz I know perfect we're looking a little more fresh now i'm going to get the hello flawless foundation powder and never settle pedal never settle pedal well I like that look mighty mite don't like a man linked on several so i'm actually grab a more feet and 500 which is like a really huge just very flimsy brush preset in to this t-zone area because i don't want a lot of power i want this look to be more in the natural site as we talked about earlier also set the under eye area this brush is great because it's only just fluffy and you know it all too much product you know deposit you want product so we're going to use the wats up basically it's a cream champagne gold highlight and we're just going to toss that on to the high plains of the cheekbones Oh Oh bitch I love that and then we're going to kind of fit in with a more PGA Tour just gonna kind of press it on very lightly to give us a nice natural glow oh my god I love this will give you this really pretty gold in champaign glow to the skin with this all I literally was alright pretty or anything let's go ahead and just coolin into our contour areas we're going to use that same 135 underbrush who's the meeting especially I don't pick up too much product and I don't want to pass it too much i mean i'm not going to go for a contoured look this is much more like just kind of bronzy glow be natural and a subtle dusting and the temples this is very hard to write like this is natural for me like bitch this isn't that true it is gonna get it shit i'm just gonna dusting the rest of the powder down my neck because i want to match my neck more i don't i don't like the smell of the powder I felt it smells like black licorice maybe i'm trippin it's mostly liquid is a lot of people of the licorice that black liquor smell i'm not one of those people that's all it's all so I'm going to have a little bit of blush we're going to grab the rocket or blush which i think is stunned needing same brush to pick up too much product doesn't deposit too much product and i think that if you're more on the natural side there's like this really cool we're going to do some blush on very lightly yeah this pitch like that when I was just before my mom got this blush and she's like almost completely done with it so funny this blush i think is really great for more of a just natural everyday pretty glowing look you know yes glow coming through glow gag we're going to the brows now we're going to grab the benefit gimme brow which is in the color medium deep which I love this little bad boy it's like looking in there was some kind of pushed out through our brows are going to more of a natural look I think this is a perfect little product because you just want to do still a little bit of the bride wore nothing to crank clean is cleaned up everything looks don't you know who I love this brow gel this is like my color too but that's pretty good for just a little tiny bit of brown gel that's this late it's like an Estancia stuff like this is good now we're going to clean up the brow with the gimme brow eyebrow pencil and we're going to really just put that in the arch of my eyebrow and that just kind of clean up make everything a little more highlighted in the busy like a cream pie light pencil I'm just use my finger i'm too lazy to do anything else we need my finger to blend it out just give a nice subtle brow bone highlight this pencil might not be for someone that's like darker and complexion even I mean it's like pretty pretty white I mean blends out like a dream the shipments out bomb I love benefits stuff honestly this is so much easier than doing it like when they did the next one I hadn't tried it like any other stuff and just on that ok you want to stop sweating I got to all my fans and literally like have a moment of like silence in the fan blowing in my face because my guess is Wayne store right now I don't know what's wrong with me ok so we're going to go ahead and do primarily this is the state don't stray primer for the lid little twisty little dough for its a little cute little thing to do is just a little bit I'm very all about a very tiny amount of private facility and just letting it out because if you use too much primary it just does the complete opposite effect like that and just off center crease so easy to blend great crease color now we just have a nice little bit of definition on the outer corner does anyone on the side this is like the most natural i think i've ever been on my channel things like a feeling you and now for the part that makes the most excited for because i feel like this is what really makes it look more on the natural site for me at least this is the new benefit roller lash mascara i absolutely love this freaking mascara the way that they tell you to use this on the box until you want to use the site that has a car that's like indented and like hook it on the base of your lashes and kind of wiggle up and I supposed to use so it's going to do that another transfer yeah that's a mascara with a just a nice one little later i think that it really doesn't amazing amazing amazing amazing job of giving me more length and more fullness and that's going to apply some on the bottom as well this shit is gone for the bottom too much because that's a look at some mascara only I don't my window and started a little bit more of a background noise now but man I was sweating more than a directly not a red carpet like I was blue panties ok ok cool so this is what it looks like with some mascara on I love love the massacre I think it's freaking sickening and you guys know I wear false lashes like all the time my lashes are really like they like to point straight down so i really have to crawl on my crazy just to get any kind of curl yeah i think that they turned out pretty good for just the mascara like this is good for me the real good for me I think honestly this mascara is better than no they're real mascara i think it's so so good i love it I love it just do a little be done so we're gonna do is we're going to grab the the been a bomb in the shade ok let me have no idea what color this is it's the red one turns out of our lives who stole the roses it's really just a lip balm with the color I just was so like little like a little school girl who doesn't wear makeup you're like super cute like you we're making and yes that was it for my one brand benefit tutorial hope you guys enjoyed this video I'm let me know what you guys thought in the comments below I love something these one brand new 12 I

it's even the title of today's video today's video is all about the new honesty in Beverly Hills modern renaissance palette this beautiful beautiful stunning mother fucker do you guys die for this because I literally die live and breathe for it I absolutely love this palette this is their new summer collection launch i believe and it feels like it has like this is really soft pink belt eat I packaging just so pretty i believe that the pans in this palette are actually larger than their previous pants on the previous palette so it is a little bit more expensive i believe the other ones were usually like 35 36 this one is 45 14 shades but I really don't think that's unfair whatsoever and this is actually a permanent part of them so I'm so excited for them actually live on associate brand i think they did such a beautiful amazing products oh um this look is inspired by someone on Instagram hold on let me find it this island I going i was actually inspired by Sophia LCS makeup on instagram i leave a little photo of her right here of her look she's the same exact palette as me and I saw on Instagram on a chg we posted her and i was like dude I'm obsessed with this looks so much that was like I need to recreate this for my followers on youtube because not always our Instagram makeup people on YouTube where they get her create a look and then you can see it on youtube and learn how to do it yourself so I wanted to take that look at that was so stunning and implement it into a video where you guys to actually learn how to create the look that she did on Instagram Sophia you did such a beautiful beautiful job and i hope i did you justice in this look as always if you guys like this video if you guys don't like me please don't fucking watch it you know the drill by now watch it but you guys like this video and you guys do like me please like this video and subscribe to my channel if you aren't already and if you knew what's up and many of you and welcome to my channel and thank you for being here so it's going to get into this really beautiful soft modern renaissance I look let's go to get started on today's a video using the Modern Renaissance Palace - Oscar Beverly Hills you guys when I open this package I was so beyond excited you guys saw me on snapchat I was living I was waiting outside for hours gagging I was gasping for air i die and i came back to life it was everything so this palette is actually amazing the colors are fucking gorgeous so it isn't going in I'm taking morphine 27 and I'm gonna go in with golden ochre which is a nice just blew jariabek the the powers are really pigmented everything a mixture of golden ochre and burnt orange and i'm going to be 27 and go into my crease very lightly Anastasio shadows are so bomb and it's funny because in the beginning when we first launched I shadows they were nice like they were good but they were definitely showers but they weren't like my go-to favorite ones i don't know i just didn't like them as much as I like to other shadows but now it's even coming out with I would have been so nice so creamy so blendable and i just love them ok so now i'm going with Morsi and 43 I'm gonna mix red ochre and regular are no real car rigged real guard I don't know how to say them sorry guys realgar and red ochre and that's gonna go in my crease is paula was inspired by Renaissance paintings and I'm sure these are probably named after some paintings or some people that made the paintings who fucking knows to be honest I'm not really that well versed in that one of this match i'm not so scholarly may I went to college but i'm using my college degree now no I'm not so we're going to push that into the crease what we have the transition change will never set a little bit lower not too heavily just very lightly keeping the most people on the outer corner because that's what the photo is the outer corner of the most amount of pigment just taking morphine 43 and blend that out myself I wasn't recording the entire time so don't like so scared that that's not recording and I have a panic attack moment they're like wait why am i recording so now i'm going to go in with the shade Venetian red and this is a really cool like cranberry shade I think it's a little shimmery tool that has a little bit of shimmer to it and I'm gonna put on the outer corner with a more fiji 27 this is a pencil brush I've been searching on more of his website for the e36 can't find it i think it's being discontinued so i'm trying to use other alternatives for you guys to another pencil brush like it the morphe g27 as another great alternative for the e36 because i know it's really hard to find so we're gonna put that on the outer corner just to give me that cranberry tone back to the look and bring it may be about one third of the way and barely bring it in and then just continue to blend that out as you can see it turned a little more cran I'm really digging the cream color so once you blend it out to your liking I think it looks pretty nice right now it's nice and blended my crease is looking defined in Chrissy I'm gonna take the shade cyprus number which is like a dark chocolaty Brown have one doing a very small amount of that on that same morphy pencil brush i'm gonna be doing a winged liner with this look so it's not going to be like a crazy amount just a very small amount on the outer corner just to add a little bit of definition and I'm just pushing that in with that morphe brush very very lightly because i really don't wanna take away any of that cranberry tone that we have I think it looks so nice take that and 43 and blend that out slightly awesomes we have everything blended out tonight I like how it's looking we are serving tuna on a platter realness fish four days fish four months fish for years okay with that so now i'm gonna go in a way the primavera on a more fiemme - 10 amazing packing brush you can always use the one that it comes with it because it does come with the packing brush but i like the more he was little better a little bit softer no tea no shade at all usually power brushes i'm not really the fan of ever so we're going with this pushes them to 10 we're going to pack primavera all over the lid it's a nice soft like golden chain of took a beautiful golden champagne no I love and on the inner third I'm gonna take it from here which is a very light almost pinky Shane let's go into a corner as well a little bit on the lid blend it into the previously shade and then just blend between the edges with a morphine for three the same one that we've been using this because it's easier it's already there ok awesome this with the top so that I should look like now it's looking very pretty very just absolutely soft and dainty but very great gorgeous i'm gonna go ahead and do eyeliner I'm gonna take the kat von d super high liner and just do a wing with that honestly trooper my cabin day just might go to favorite eyeliner it's so easy to use you get a sharp line a very very easily it's a very black I just really really do enjoy this eyeliner going to do when we usually do it okay great so now we have the I later on it should look something like this is a very easy not too intense not to to bowl of a liner I don't know that's too bold for you but the liner however you would like to do it i just like to do I have it like this is actually really subdued liner for me so much and I think we're pretty good so I'm gonna go ahead and do the bottom of that lash line now on the photo says that all she used was love letter so I think that's where we're going we're going to take just love letter on the lower lash line I'm gonna take that same g27 and dip it into love letter which they really pretty like blemish pink actually something I might mix more than just this color but for now let's just try this I don't know who lives here so we can use that this color is stunning click crowd and you can take a little bit of the golden ochre and when the underneath this part just give me a little bit more with seamless blend and then i'm going to put the colour-pop lip liner in the shade and Lori any burgundy eyeliner will work I just can't find any burgundy liners right now remember in the underneath the lash line burgundy imac would work great too . this color would be absolutely perfect for this look okay go over to go finish that off camera okay I'll be right back ok so now this is the final product I have the lashes on my iconic by house of lashes and I thought that this would be such a pretty lash with this look because everything is really just like elongated and there's a wing it is an outer corner and i'm done with the ice so I'm going to be guided to see what they look like up close okay great so now that the eyes are done we're going to continue on with the lips now I'm gonna take a lip liner and lipstick is actually the most expensive lip come by thing I've ever done on my channel so they do it still yes I should I well something the charlotte tilbury lip cheat in the shade iconic nude and this is a nice neutral asian nude shade to the pine so this is actually more like a brown beige lip liner and I don't ever go for the cyclic ketones soho this is a little different for me and once we r lip line and we look like actually that from the fucking cell and from the value we take the YSL lipstick in the shade number 10 Samantha this is Samantha always talk about the shade and i bought this in Canada but you know what if i'm gonna buy this is all color on a bite in canada won because the dollars better and two because Samantha isn't getting us so i wanted to use this shade I've actually tried it on camera yet but it's absolutely beautiful you graduate and shit yourself she said this like her perfect nude shade and I completely agree with their it's absolutely stunning such a beautiful formula consistency I it's not mad at all it's not said it's nothing more of a cream consistency is very pretty and lightweight feeling but it's very creamy and hydrating and this is the final look and that is it for the entire video hope you

time he wasn't being really lame thing you're gonna have to go somewhere already primed my skin off of camera i used benefit Porefessional I wanted a really nice clean smooth surface for that and professional silicone based primer flawlessness for that ok so today I'm gonna take a mixture of my L'Oreal prom and fallible and the NARS all day luminous talked about this combo like a while back we're going to like kind of old school and my old school I mean like what like comments I love the program available combined with no sugar low because my natural finish but its full coverage that the weirdest thing I can't really explain it if you guys have tried to come at me with an arsenal you know exactly what I'm talking about the north by itself I can't do like I think it's too luminous and I don't think it last all day on me know but combined with the program at it like gives me like a magnifying effect and i love it was coming out the back of my head and dotting it everywhere if you guys watched my haul video recently i just got a bunch of the new more freely collection brushes so i'm going to be using the e-40 for today just to kind of see how it is to cut out how to get something really nice though I'm not gonna lie i can look come thru airbrush foundation the fuck and never take a couple drops of the NARS foundation afternoon down my neck with a single fucking brush if you want a nice like airbrush finish this is the brush for you and it's densely packed enough word like it packs on a good amount of foundation but it's also loose enough where it kind of bust out everything really really flawlessly and airbrushed of us can tell because until the camera but it looks super super pretty recent at the foundation is done i'm gonna go in with the make up for ever Ultra HD concealer I uses previously in a video and I really really liked how it turned out underneath my eye the consistency is so so nice it's like sick but it's not to think it doesn't crease easy on me whatsoever so i really like that because most things kris on me like crazy I'm going to lay in shit with it you better it out but it's so pretty its full coverage blends like a fucking dream her fixing that we are bright and highlighted go ahead and set the under I'm gonna be taking one of the new more fees it's the easy 48 which is like a nice little like small maybe like to brush I'm gonna set my under eye with the laura mercier secret brightening as per you guys just did the bitch in and now to set the face i'm going to take my new be 41 i'm sorry i'm using all the new like elite brushes i just recently because you know you can you brush is just like me two years that's what I feel right now so I'm gonna take the c 41 like a little bit of it I just love a big and I'm gonna take the Urban Decay HD powder and set the whole place with it now that our skin is as clear as we're going to get it we're going to take the morphe and five to seven my favorite bronzing brush i love it and who led by benefit my go-to bronzer it's my favorite like I'm i love this bronzer and just kind of going in all the temples in the hollows of my cheeks done much in a little bit and then I'll take my jawline just kind of accentuate the John a little bit more recently i got this like a ultrasound laser on my I like the fat of my chin like in this area it's an ultrasound that like kind of attacks the really really pesky fact that you have underneath your chin basically anywhere they have pesky fat kind of targets that and for me it's underneath my chin it's like such shit I lost like 15 pounds since I quit drinking diet soda and doing so much more water and its place and i still cannot get rid of the fucking pesky under the chin fat are here i'm just trying to conquer the fucking bitch away not really working but he said the results are gonna be coming in the next four to six weeks and i just got it like a week ago so I'm hoping that that chin fat will be no more no more that's what I underneath the eyes a little bit of taking that same me 48 brush and the Kat Von D shade and light using the banana sheet right here going to hit pan on because it's as a good shade that is some good shit right there I managed to kind of highlight a little bit underneath that I nothing too crazy it's not that step is done i'm gonna go and kind of cook the contour and basically what that means is i'm going to highlight underneath my contour kind of emphasize the sharp lines of a I'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent setting powder and a little beauty blender going to be the control basically wherever I wanted to come to be sharp like so and then once you wipe that away it's going to be a lot more clean and sharp and really gorgeous and very Claude toward the close and now we are nice and how did contour and contoured I mean with contoured i'm gonna go ahead and take a blush now I got this recently and I died for its the two-faced little like love flushed hearts palette like that much little heart makes when it's not so much a little harder than your blushes and I really want to use one of these and i think what i'm going to use is a mixture of love hangover and I will always love you and I'm gonna take that one anymore p53 brush just kind of dip into it and go in i'm gonna go on with all the but a goodie we're going to take the makeup ever pull sculpting duo in the shade number two which is this basically take the gold shade gonna take that shit on the same brush because this is a nice like flat angled brush and I really want kinda want to highlight with it to look at that shit for all good the shit is so I'm just kind of wipe away the cookin themselves as well as I forgot how much i love it what I live and breathe for it like so we're going to start the eyes now already went ahead and did my eyebrows off camera and I prime my eyes already a scary because I feel like that step is just so not show LA it's so unnecessary to show you guys cause you guys probably know what I do because I'm showing you guys so many times and I don't want to bore you bitches you know I really want to use a new advisor at palate today that when I hold so I'm gonna be using that today and then I have a couple other individual shades are going to use it because i really wanted to incorporate a very bronzy very glittery like had a holiday look so I thought I'm gonna be doing to day on the ice so first things first I'm gonna take beaches and cream by making keep which is one of my favorite shades from makeup geek it is the perfect transition for me for my skin tone if you're lighter than me or my complexion or a little bit darker it will definitely work for you I'm taking on a 27 ever to hit pan on it because like twice it's so so good and I'm just going to go into the crease I like a lot about the transition shade is that it's not too warm and it's not too cool it's literally like a very neutral peachy Shane or another really really popular shade by makeup geek is peach smoothie I love that one so much as well but this one it just kind of my go-to if you have been watching for a while you guys know that beaches and ha is like my shit and my titties combined court so we have that into the crease but that Marky 27 you guys code more free man you at all caps and store online boom ten percent off hello that was the fastest fucking affiliate push I've ever done I'm gonna fight with Murphy just letting you guys know I'm us he was a member said oh ok now I'm going with the visor palette i'm so excited to be using this through i'm gonna take a mixture of these two shades right here it's not going anymore fee and 433 basically going back to 17 do and that's going to go into the crease the visor shadows guys are so beautiful or busy right where the fuck you wanna call it I'm just gonna kind of go in and start creating my crease with this color all the way to the front of the eye and then I wasn't getting closer and closer to being a lot lighter pressure I feel like with the bronze glory look and orange transition shade will be so beautiful that blend are you joking like that blend was seamless to have eyes on you fucking bitch and Olivia so I'm gonna take it is a very warm chocolate brown shade on that same in 43 a little bit less product and that's gonna go into the crease as well we're going to add so much dimension in this look it's going to be fucking dimensional ok so I'm going to take that on the outer corner and really start pushing that into the crease I'm taking it all the way into the front of the eye as well a little bit lower than I have at the transition shade that we have down first and I'm taking and 40 and 50 cent which is a more precise pencil brush is like very pointed and precise I'm going to take this gorgeous like deep maroon shade it's not a bronzy warm tutorial without this color eye color like maroon because I'm very maroon maroon is that the color of my salt so I'm gonna go in with that one of us a little bit lower than the other shades not going to go all the way into the front again just like a deal with the other shades lower than my other transitions I swear this is going to be like the ultimate transitional thing I'm just taking a clean blending brush is a morphy 13 I'm gonna just clean out those edges a little bit clean up those edges nothing looks too too harsh and then grabbing the Anasazi Beverly Hills fudge is actually part of our newest collection they just did a new fall collection on a morphine 36 a very small pencil brush that's going to go into my crease for some added dimension definition but it's going to take the darkest of the shades it's a very dark chocolatey chocolate put that in the crease and fudge is going to lowest possible into our crease right up to that very very warm transition that we got going on and I just go halfway in and I'm not going to take it all the way in like I did the chains this was just going to go halfway in and see me deepest at the outer corner as i think i'm going to be doing a winged liner with this little perfect about you have this fiery warm crease going on right now i'm going to start with the lid now I grabbed my makeup geek grandstand eyeshadow i think it's such a beautiful bronzy shade and I think it's gonna be perfect with this look like actually perfect Anton and Jaffe and for 21 which is a very nice flat packing brush it kinda reminds me of the mac one and i'm sure those are packing out onto the lid it's such a beautiful bronze shade obviously i'm gonna be putting glitter on top so it's just going to my base color right now to have underneath the glitter to give it more dimension and now for the fun part i'm going to be taking v2 faced shadow insurance clicker and mac reflex bronze and glitter and that's gonna go on top of the lid but I'm gonna take that same brush them for 21 from morphe the Too Faced shadow insurance clear glue is probably my favorite glitter glue that I've ever ever ever ever tried i think it's so so good and you guys are looking for a good glue the two this one is sick and then we're going to kind of pack on some glitter glue taking some of the glitter just dipping what you can dig my hole brush in it and just pray and just go ahead and start packing on the lid I'm obsessed I love mac reflex glares because they're so finely milled they're not an intense chunky glitter they're basically like a pigment with a lot of glitter in it and that's why I love it so much she doesn't see how sickening the reflection is it's very cool very cool so let's go ahead and finish the other half the camera back and I'll be right back so the eyes look like so far also rather like just like a random side know you guys do not need advise our palate to do this i know that the power is hella expensive but you don't use this palette to be able to accomplish this but you can use like the morphe 35o it's very warm just like this you can use some makeup geek eyeshadows you can use whatever you guys have at your disposal so just don't do that you need to use the device our palate to be able to accomplish this look I just got this i wanted to use it because I love you haven't asked me to use it so this is what I came up with so far hope you guys like the eyes okay great so I went and I did my liner off of camera I just need both hands and I need a mirror to be this close to do it us know what I mean like when you do your eyeliner and you like you need to be like holding your breath looking this close that's all you do so yeah I don't have camera so now that my eyes are beat to death i can feel the pain posted through my body I'm going to go into the bottom lash line now so we're gonna grab the Urban Decay perversion liner I was the beating i was like fuck I want to do a smokey bottom lash line I don't want to do like more like an actress bottom lash line but i think because we're going so like festive and so holiday and you want to catch the bitches ice from the fucking end of the room we're going to go with smoking on the bottom and shine because we smokey says we're playing around we mess with the bitches sup perfect never take a line the lower water it doesn't have to be like fucking meter anything like that you just need to line it taking the same be 36 pencil brush we're going to start just diving into the colors that we use from the visor palette all the four up here we're going to start diving in using those colors we're going to kind of blend out this lower lash line I'm going to first go in with a really chocolaty shape right here well maybe you should like blend out the liner first fourth and final eight blend out of that perversion liner a little bit there are blending out the lower lash line they see what we did on the top we're going to do at the bottom as well so taking that she was going to kind of blend over the black with the e36 pencil brush and then now taking a 18 by Morpheus while transitioning out like we did at the top we're doing at the bottom making it very warm ok so when head I did a lot of camera i think so i went ahead and i put on my lashes off camera because it was just gonna be a little easier that way i am using the new bounce some fella lashes you guys know Bella lashes from you about some are my favorite lashes are so flattering so dramatic and so like extra but i think the super badass and I let me about some as a brand that they offer their affiliates which I am twenty percent off their followers Michael's man emu is interested in you as you save twenty percent off the entire site so i think that's super super cool and I think it's really great that they offer that to you guys so thinking about some music for you guys in to see what the final and looks like up close perfect not the face is completely done I'm gonna do the lips now actually just did a flip and I didn't even like it so I took it off and now doing another one I decided because my eyes are definitely more in the smoky side more than ten side and I really wanted to keep the focus here I want to go with more of a nude lip you can do whatever you want to do you want to read do Redman do a dark ass maroon do whatever you want to do but i wanted to a new dish lip because I mean recently i've done like the last video I war had a nice video before that were like a brown lipstick I'm like you know

cosmetics I'm thinking about doing a new series on my channel where I'm doing full-on full-blown full-face tutorials with just one brand and I think this is the first 1 i'm starting with his next um I was very very very very very hesitant to create this video I do love a lot of nice things but I do not love a lot of mixed things as well and this is the first time trying a lot of things on myself in the tutorial and I'm not the same person like after you have noticed I'm not the type of person to talk shit about a brand or talk shit about a product on my channel a lot of people do that and it's great for a lot of people they like doing that but it's not my style I don't like talking shit about other brands and like about other products I like talking great about products and then just not mentioning products i don't like you know I mean so the fact that i haven't tried to love the next up I used in this video makes me nervous because it's like okay with us going to see if I like it or not it's gonna be right there an obvious so i hope you guys don't mind that we're if you guys can see like I don't like a product on but I don't need to talk to any brand yeah if you guys want to see that that have been going sorry it was long and show but I just I just had to say that because I'm just I'm not used to this kind of video so let me know what you guys thought if you guys like this kind of video and then of course i'll continue to do it but I was like am I going to do this because I want to talk shit but sometimes people need constructive criticism you know I'm you guys don't like the video don't fucking watch it don't if you don't like that shit yeah ok go to the store and my ok cool so let's go and get the show on the road we're going to the full face today i'm super-nervous be filming this because i don't like I don't do this kind of thing like that we'll talk about products I've never tried before on camera we're going to do is we're going to go and start with the next angel veil skin perfecting primer this one this one is one of the ones i have tried and didn't just put that much honestly I really do love like this primary like I think it's really pretty I think would be really nice base and fields next to the skin does it feel to Silicon e but it definitely feels like it has a slip to it so i think we should go on to it really nicely let's just say about it but that's a pretty good product i like that primer next we're going to the next studio photogenic foundation and she wanted to soft beige we're gonna get all of it on the back of my hand foundation is very very very liquidy like has so much like slip to it and honestly like I tried this foundation - so far i have really weird mixed feelings about this foundation because i think that it doesn't give enough coverage to have to use a lot of product it leaves you with a satin finish and I'm not into satin finishes for my foundation I like to make my foundation like Matt and then I make it more on glow in certain areas that I want to be good so now i'm going to go ahead and take mine more feet and 4 39 and we're going to really press the foundation into the skin I was gonna use a beauty blender with this but the Beauty Blender really it looks even more like this one I really want to just press the donation in because i want to keep the medium coverage this is like a medium coverage foundation and I really want to leave at least keep the medium coverage I want more but it's light and my nose is like rejecting this foundation good like my nose is not having it we have one layer of foundation on my put a lot of it on but I mean they believe her down what do you think next I'm gonna grab the NYX HD concealer in the shade light and that was going to conceal under is it like that with the concealer I tried this consider literally only one time before we'll see how my opinion out what I think about it right now on the forehead as well this is kind of weird then we go in without marking the same morphe brush and really just press it in let them see you there actually no I'm going to go ahead and take the m 4 39 my morphe which is a smaller kabuki brush and buff out the concealer I like this considered I think it's a really pretty concealer I do I really do it gives me a nice medium to full coverage it doesn't settle too terribly and comes pretty well with the concealer and makes it look like I have much more full coverage which is really like not to map not too bad computer I like you you win me over it's going to be a little bit on the islands as well just a prime for nationals later not using concealer is primary cell a very light layer of it because you want to crease is going to the opposite effect if you put way too much so we're going to put a very light amount of concealer on the lead I look like a fucking ghost so now we're going to go ahead and take the next highlight in control pro palette i haven't tried this one yet I guess we'll see what I think we're right now and we're going to use the banana shade for the under highlighting let's go ahead and load up my more free and 4 30 a brush so when i dip into the product i notice that's really powdery so a lot of product is actually tell but around the around the pan there's a lot of excess part that lifts up which is kind of annoying but I can do with that so we're going to go ahead and set the underground with this and then go and see your eyelids as well i'll have my life I don't know if I like this a lot honestly so far I'm not feeling it it's too powdery doughnuts for the bronzer so let's go ahead and take it like any kind of brush like this like a little paddle brush we're going to go ahead and dip into this color here so he said this is how I feel the pygmy is great because it's like there's a lot of pigment that comes up but it's so ridiculously it's so ridiculously pottery it's just it's such a mess ok let's go ahead and bronze look I feel like it's patchy like do not see like there's like patching is here I'm just going back in with my foundation brush and just kind of carving out the bottom of it to help with the patchiness much better it's a little more diffused now at least but you know where we're going to use everything that we can because this is a full next two are you gonna do another thing i don't like about this part is that every single color here gives a satin finish never liked truly mad which I don't like i wanted i wanted to give me more of a matte finish especially when i'm going in with more bronzy colors for my contour going to go ahead and grab this color all the way over here and that's going to be our like highlight tone color thing really pretty scene when you look at it in here it looks much more warm than this one is really pale and super like silver this one of the things that little more warmer but this one looks silver on me trying to work with that work with that and now we're going to go in with toe blush by next I hear about this blush all the freaking time that's like super amazing so bomb and it gives you a really nice pretty contours are going to try it right now I have to try to get so we'll see i'm going to use the rounded brush brush my make a geek like my normal contour brush I use i'm just going to control with that it definitely is much more of a cool tone bronzy look I'm not usually doing cool tone contours which is so finding can click so controversial like I always do like really warm contour that's a style i like to do but um you know what I i think this is cute i like this is a taupe is cute I can see why people like it for sure ok so we're contoured and ribbons we're going to go in with Nick's amber blush with him or Fiji eight now we're just going to put in turn blush area toss it on I'm sure is pretty Oh super pigmented why do i do this to myself okay you know what if we have a lot of blood on its fine we're going to go back on that foundation brush really just press over it eight plus pigmentation nyx cosmetics from the blushes holy titty in my face is coming together now it's looking better looking better for sure okay so we're done with the face basically I think we're good to go these are you gonna go into our brows first stories do our eyes I'm gonna go in with the next eyebrow gel waterproof eye brow gel and espresso and he hopes to express my last month we have tried to browse already I'm i don't really honestly my opinion on the bridge on their very intense it's hard to get a small amount and like not look dry clean it but um I think the colors really nice something like going really smoothly but I wish that they lasted longer on the brows because they don't last as long as I want to do is you want to see like a waterproof like I don't think the water looks like they definitely will come off so your brows you do not normally overturning closer yeah and then I'm going to go in with the Knicks attention brown mascara and the color black not really black and the brown take a deep brown I have tried this one yet so we'll see how this goes please be okay what is it there please be a good product mm-hmm no sweetheart uh-huh so not gonna work for me ok so the reason I don't like it because it's kind of chunky and the way implies it doesn't apply evenly on the Browse like when you're like if you have a spot on your brother that guys like a lot of hair and you're going to go over it like the skit and it will apply like a lot towards like where I have more hair so and then also what kind of moves that's why I didn't want to be removed and just it feels like wax honestly just feel like wax it doesn't feel , brow gel should feel like I have dinosaur growls in those rooms are bomb that this one don't worry i wanted to like you're really into that but I don't after trial and carbon this is what the Browns end up looking like i'm trying to get away from being like more fleet proud I am trying to more like the natural brown but products i had did not allow me to do natural I have to go fleek the parts maybe go for a week and had no joining the handle and now we're doing is we're going to go ahead and go back in with this palette I know he don't like you very much but we're going to be strong we're gonna use it so i'm using my shadow so our windows going to go out this color here which is a basically I'm cream color and that we're going to toss in to make sure everything kind of blend into everything a lot easier on a sigma e40 to highlight and contour shades like they're very pigmented but they're so hot early it just drives me insane i couldn't use them just based on the fact they're they're going with the morphine for 3 which is like my favorite movie brushes and then we're going to go ahead and go in with this shade right here the 1i used to bronze with that we're going to toss into the crease we're gonna carve out the decrease with it was like that looks pretty nice I'm really impressed with as a shadow . patches a shadow but it's catching on the face that's like I'm going then we're going with the easy for teams kind of blend I'm a firm believer in even if you'd like the shadiest shadows of the shittiest product if you have a good brush everything will turn out okay and then i'm going in with a Kentucky little flat brush and walking in with that same cream color we used just kind of highlighting the brow bone with it a nice pretty bone white color now we're actually going to go in with an eyeshadow called The Chaser fashion fascination I don't know what this is I had no idea what it's called not a single clue what that was going to go and we're going to talk about into the outer corner just for some extra dimension little bit more of a cool tone brown how many is that more like a contour Brown who like that country like it I like that kind of law I'm really impressed with how these blend on the i am not gonna lie i right and they're not hard to blend out on I am NOT faces another story another story in the face but I pretty good how about those tools that were using now we're going to go in with the girl talk I shadow the girl talk is actually part of the new prismatic shadows are launching honestly the prismatic channels are freaking bomb dude like I'm so impressed by these prismatic shadows we're going to press it on your eyelid not that we're going to use our finger press on to the lid look at that that's nice right up to the crease and then we're going to kind of go in with that and 43 just going to blend out the edges let's go into something fun we're going to go ahead and grab makes the studio liquid liner in stream below which was like this and that we're going to use our Island oh my god that was mentioned I battle is my shit we're just gonna go ahead and go underneath it and just kind of clean it up with concealer problem number one with this is that you can see right here is because it's so liquid that end up going into like a wrinkle in my eye and now it transferred upwards but for now let's just focus on the liner to get straight as possible everything would've been so perfect it just did not transfer her we're going to do is we're going to go to the concealer like it that way I'm gonna let that dry for a lot of concealer dry and then we're going to go over with some shadow later go now that we're dealing with the madness was just loaded crying it's gonna be fine it's gonna be fucking upon are you going with the next tray jolie eyeliner and brown and I think this one is really cute i feel like it's built pretty well actually in that you have a little twist top and a nice liner I think it's really pretty and I waterline these payment in like that and I buff it out nice warm brown like that you were quickly with this thing is drying fast and we're going to go in with that same bronzing claro used and then we're going to buff that over the liner because i don't want to be too dark just want to be pretty warm and if you can if everything is dry just going to go back to work on a bus in that concealer ok so that's what that looks like now that we had a couple hiccups but it's fine we dealt with it or strong bitches we can do with this shit okay well first I real quick off camera I'll be back so now we're going to apply some mascara we're going to use mix the skinny mascara which is a new product for them it's like literally like the tiny thing I've ever seen it and I think it's kind of a badass to let me help um this message is a Fed nominal Alex separating lashes I don't think it's really meant for the top to be honest but I don't have any other next month's care for the top so I'm just gonna make it work make it work with Tyra says bitch make it work so perfect for the bottom of my little bit it's a little i'm never going to put myself in the eye again cause you know I got my scare on the top and the bottom doesn't matter for the top like I'm just doing it to make it look a little more black because we're going to go in with policies anyway so don't even trip we're going to go in with falsies I haven't yet this is the mu para number one when i open this . I just I'm like can you even think we need one time I saw Scott Barnes going on his lashes like higher so I started playing on my lashes with her hair yes slashes are so good i want to slap my camera they're so good at that yeah test finally got the I look out down he finally got that I looked down so i'm going to be guys in for a final I look now that we're done with the eyes we get a move on to my favorite part which is always the lips you guys know that you're like my go-to thing I love doing lipstick i love doing I think I'm going with makes people neutral lip liner which i use the better all the time and the fact that this is like it makes all next tutorial will be so happy come I can't use you ok so you like you look so ever you want to win them this color is live and i use it so much that i know i love it already so I'm like I'm not worried about not liking a product you know we're just going to go ahead and line like have to live and then i'm going to go ahead and grab the next soft matte lip cream in east on board it's a nice town good no no accident that was on a business the blacks and abba I tried to Istanbul I was that is not so good like cake batter something about just such a pretty color oh my gosh they smell amazing they apply amazing but definitely not that mad like a cream that creme lipstick formula i don't really see them as being any kind of mattifying may be able to drive my lips never tried this before so see you getting mad at me now and I do you like it yeah and that was it for the final look hopefully you liked it I think this is really cool i think it's fun to kind of test out a whole entire brand to do a full face could be like resourceful you have to use a browser as eyeshadow or something that you have to be resourceful and I think it's fine i know i don't really like everything that i use but i think that the final product came out pretty nicely I think you can do is going to look for a lot less money than looks like done in the past so I think that's really really really really cool let me know if you guys really want this to be serious - I can do it with a couple more brands i think that would be so fun to do like a series like a playlist on my channel was like one brand tutorial is like where it's like i'm using one brand the entire to tour I've seen some other people do it too and I think it's so fun to watch because I'm Michael your social little bitch love you yeah so follow me on Instagram Twitter hit me up on any of those social media outlets I am much more active on Twitter and Instagram the name on youtube I would say only get a post once a week right now I'm but I'm trying to post more frequently and often you know the land of any type of suggestions you have for other videos in the future i love when you I suggest like things for me to do um so I can fucking do them nicely yeah i'll give it a night . you guys are and i will catch you in my next video hello everyone welcome back to my channel spacing is going to be a tutorial on this I look that I have going on right now this is the look that I was wearing a big patrick Star claps both of the class i did i had this look that was wearing and I got so many freaking request to do this looks well as I do okay i'm going to do it when might as well we got someone has to do it so i hope you guys like it also I just need to say this right now the Silver Hand home but i'm going to be going to beauty contactless much 14 is the day of beauty contest and i'm going to be there I am a project beautiful ambassador for beautycon jealous I really know that entails yeah to be honest but i'll link what project beautiful is and things like that down below in the description bar if you guys are interested because you'll be going to be content us I would really love to meet you guys there i've never been to be Carmen in Texas so for your random but i'm so excited it's funny because me and Patrick entered a competition together to kind of just like with tickets for project beautiful which is like basically like a beauty channel network we entered it together or like one of the stuff we want like this like trip to go to dallas but we have to do it and we both want for both can be going to dallas together in like two weeks so you guys are in the Dallas area and are interested in and saying hi or whatnot are going to be , I would love to meet you guys there st.

video don't fucking watch it you know that you're with that and yes i'm sad isn't it all right yes I'll get you guys to trial sorry for the long intro but it's how to introduce that I'm really really really excited to go to me to Khandala see clearly in like two weeks like it's so freakin fast and random but just like this pattern some back and let's go to tell you guys I'm so excited to see this yeah okay just tutorial site hey guys ok so basically starting with our base completely done already i have like my contour on my head like going I was bronzed she's bronze and ready to go I'm i do not remember exactly what i did for the tutorial like I remember exactly close i use but basically grabbed a bunch of clothes i think i use so we're going to try to still do it wish me luck first we're going to do is going to go ahead and take beaches and cream i'm a geek which is this color here and that's gonna be our transition shade on an e 40 we're going to go and just toss that into our crease the reason I'm having it down first because i want to have a color down to be able to blend all my other colors into first but it's already primed by the way that's what I fear may be shadows of all time I still need to make a favor make a big shadow video so let me just don't want that we're going to mix bitten by makeup geek and cocoa bear by making because we're to make them together we're going to toss that into our outer corner on a more feet and 4 33 which is especially is very often it's very so much of mac 217 I'm just going to us on the outer corner very likely very softly the maybe shadows are so freaking pigmented like you guys know maybe because my favorite brand of all life we're also going to toss it into our inner corner as well right into the crease so let's look at the close down in the outer and inner corner I we're going to do is we're going to make a halo that brush with no additional color I was going to very lightly etch out where a crease it is very light motion like that so you can see how this nice little ring around my eye and we're going to the center completely open cup for shimmery colors gonna go I was leaving that right here and i'll just go back in with that same be 40 x sigma and i'm just going to blend the edges this is why i was so crucial to have that beaches and cream color down first so we can have a base that the colors blend into nicely see how nicely that's running out just because we have that base down it makes such a huge difference to me now that we have that nice warm halo we look going down now i'm actually going to go ahead and grab a starter Beverly Hills beauty mark shadow which is basically a very very very deep dark plum put it right between the Barone and the inner corner so we're going to write here this is going to give us the definition in the death or it's gonna like a feather it and that we're doing that on a like a little pencil brush like that you got a little bar on jets the outer corner as well so they don't go back in with that same and for 33 and just kind of blend out the edges again no additional part i'm just letting it blend out very softly it looks something like this it's a nice dark hey Louie effect this is optional but I'm gonna just go back in with a little bit of black from making big it's called correct at a very tiny amount in the innermost corner just for that little bit of extra depth and dimension this part is optional you definitely don't need to do this but I figured what the fuck why not you know this book is very pigmented so you don't need a lot of trust me making like a little outer V now we're going to go in with a clean brush it's a morpheme 441 it's just a clean fluffy brush and that was going to kind of blend the whole thing that brushes clean so I just really wanted to have it there from blending purposes only not for depositing color and now we'll go back in with the e-40 and just blend out those edges even more with no additional product at all is well this looks so easy but I swear it's so freaking easy sorry I'm funny how easy this shit is but it looks a little bit intimidating when you first like see it but honestly you know you have the tools to get the colors you're good to go and of course i have a code with morphe brushes it's manny anyway in all caps and you get ten percent off i mean it's a little it's a little co2 little Commission code you guys don't need to use that code if you guys wanted the morphe brushes already so cost efficient or not like expensive at all so if you don't want to say no 10-percent then go right ahead and use it and in fact it's all good but it's one league has no got the option is there cool so now we're going to do is we're gonna go ahead and grab a flat brush I'm gonna use the exact blend you 32 x sigma and then I'm gonna grab makeup geek shimma shimma which is like a very shimmery champagne tone and now we're going to talk to Lynn right into the center and so what's gonna bring a lot of focus of the eye and then I'll go in with that same morphe brush that in 43 and just kind of blend out those edges a little bit with no additional product yeah yeah ok so i went ahead and grabbed an eyeliner I'm describing the one by the bomb it's the mr. right now Dean eyeliner pencil everything that they do is so cute i was going to run out of the water line as well as underneath the lash line very lightly I'm going to blend it out we're going to go ahead and grab the same bin and coke shadow on the little pencil brush and we're going to run over that black with the shadows and then we're going to blend out those even more places that pay for that I let go and finish that I real quick and I'll be right back okay cool no you're both eyes done is what they look like both eyes done real now clock me you can't I know I can't clock this bitch I'm gonna use the Too Faced better than sex mascara all day but good oh my god . click on my care of me it is the clock and I need to be a dinner at eight and i still want me to help me please oh I love this mascara forgot how much i really liked it really gives you volume and extension cable network for the bottom line we're going to use the next skinny mascara which is killing 21 and I think it's literally perfect for the bottom lashes those of you who are looking forward to booking my high again bitch think oh good so I'm going to go in with some falsies of course the falls i was wearing in that video where the believe you parent number two which give a really pretty like lifted flare especially in the center I think it's going to be great for this look because we already have a lot of focus towards the center of the lid to make it look a little bit more round and pretty seems like she's just really give you so much extension because they lift up naturally blinking view lashes honestly you guys like they are the best mean clashes I never used and I tried a lot I've been sent a lot of new clashes and blinking is definitely definitely definitely my favorite and I don't know what it is like their styles are a little bit different than other pairs their band is super super super comfortable and they just they just last a long time already used it sparingly 10 times they look as if I just barely open them but they look amazing i love them and I have a code is blinking um g10 and you say ten percent I mean it's cool if you don't use it you don't have to do anything that but it's an option there if you want to save some money on me I mean parents usually 35 bucks that mean clashes because they last a long time but these ones are 30 and then you get to save on the three bucks if you use a code so you get for 27 but I've never I've never seen in clashes sold for $27 ever ever ever ever I know the best one I've ever used so we commute you guys are so good to me honestly you guys like slay me this is what the lashes look like holy crap look so that means that you guys need for a final Ilyich awesome not only that I look down let's go ahead just finished the faceoff because like I feel like a little bit weird only having like contoured how they done so we're so it's going to take my favorite highlighter of like life right now Rebecca opal highlight by a cosmetic clinic and we're going to take a more fan brush just gonna just not into our highlight areas I love this house because it gives you a really really pretty golden reflect to it but it's not like just gold it gives you like a champagne gold it's not like just let yellow gold it's like a really beautiful champagne gold and I feel like it goes with so many different skin tones honestly like this is one of my favorite highlights of life because I feel like any single person can wear it and its own beautiful on everyone yes like yes bitch I guess now that we are highlighted we're going to go ahead and do blush and we're going to go ahead and go in with the tart blushing bride blush was like this isn't that

snapchat you guys know I was like if you i scan before it sells out go boom shadow which is the one on my littering how it is the most different multi-dimensional glittery eyeshadow I've ever tried it's so freaking sickening and you guys go buy it or don't talk to me every day but it's seriously so beautiful and absolutely love it i wanted to recreate the look that I was wearing when I wore it for the first time during famous pub so I kind of did as best as I could and this is what came up with just more wearable not so red version of it but I think you're not fucking behind you guys want to see how you did this look please continue to watch it don't like me that's like this video don't fucking watching you into the drill with that but if you like this video and you guys do like me please like this video and subscribe to my channel if you weren't already so yeah just going to get it right into the video okay who's ready for this is mario oh I've built in so long i'm fucking where you're going home where I'm going to go so much going to start this tutorial with the face already done at my base on i use the Born This Way Foundation you want they just launched by to face i am trying for the first time right now on my face nothing looks really really nice and the reason i decided to my face already is because this tutorial is more on the like intricate side like this more steps to doing this look then it looks but i'm going to go ahead and just have my face are you done don't give me no lip so let's go and start this Beach ok cool so first things first I'm going to start in with peaches and cream and Peach Smoothie by makeup geek I'm going to mix those on my brush because i kind of want to be a little more warm than usual and i'm having a little bit of peach smoothie because i usually go to my beaches and communities no beaches and cream isn't my favorite transition shade of all time but I wanted to be slightly more warm than usual so that's why I'm having the Peach Smoothie into it oh and i'm already primed on the lids and my browser kind of filled in with some brow gel so forget it was wondering like this it's really going in with nothing no I'm already primed with this e27 this is like my favorite i'm blending brush right now it's a very similar similar to the e 40 x sigma and Matthew 24 just a really great fluffy blending brush which looks something like this it's just easy transition very very low-key can invade be honest i'm going to take a more feet and 4 33 which is very similar due to the mac 217 and i'm going to mix cocoa bear i'm a geek with secretive my morphe i just discovered the shadow recently I've actually using the tutorial but it looks so effing pretty I had literally like a to use it sometimes it on the outer corner and i'm mixing the two Colbert and secretive secret is a very very very warm deep maroon color it's so nice it's so freakin nice I've never even like going any of the morphe single shadows i got them when I was a famous bow so I was like Hello what the hell I'm doing not only getting the single shot with Murphy okay so I'm gonna go and take that and for 33 and those two colors and put it into my crease a little bit lower than I thought the transition colors right up into the inner corner because this is more of a smoky eye i'm having my eyes open for this so i can see exactly where the shadow will be when my eyes are open the secret of shadow you're making a lot of bitten but it is more red than Britain's not have to travel down there just place down there's no blending going on that you 27 really just blend out the shadows in to the transitions that we had down first this is gonna really help keep everything a lot more blended and a lot more diffuse this is why i have the shadows down first and it's going circular motions without you 27 I love this blending brush to death you are using extremely extremely warm tones so that you're gonna have to continue to blend blend blend and just when you think that you're done blending blending a little bit more than you're good it's where it should look something like this nice and blended out very warm cranberry Brown i get your noises my converse you're fucking-a now I'm gonna go in with that same for 3 with a white a little bit off on my pants and I'm gonna go in without especially health beauty mark shadow is one my favorite rappers of all time it's a beautiful warm plummeting a plum brown it's so fucking pretty I use it all the time you guys don't use the whole time I'm going to concentrate on the outer corner because this is going to be more of a smoky look and there's kind of blending it forward into the crease ok now that you have this bad boy blend it out nice little warm intense crease going on right now pretty smoky we're going to grab the two-faced glitter glue it looks like this i saw Jacqueline using this and so obviously i was like what Jackson illusion that and we're gonna put that all over the lid i'm going to go ahead and use any synthetic brush i'm gonna use the more feet 320 i'm in love with the whole lid all the way up to the crease and then now for the star of the show that everyone was asking me to talk about it is boom boom shadow by Mac that's a dazzle shadow is one of the newest shades it's one of the most beautiful shots never even come across ever and I'm going to cut my finger I'm gonna put that onto the lid and press it on my god i love using this with a glitter glue down first because it really makes the shadow pop underneath it as well as it's going to stay there all freakin day just many ways to an event and that bitch stayed on now to take that and 43 and just come and go in to the crease with a slightly blend out any hard lines usually when using glitter glue and glitter like there will be hard lines just a little baby amount of blending bull really hope this is what the top of the list look like i'm gonna go ahead and finish the other I off-camera when we come back we'll do the bottom of the eyes and we'll be doing ok ok ok so i have both of the eyes done on the top even don't even if it doesn't huggles you like the life but like the cuter version called goggles ok ok since the tops of eyes are done it's going to focus on the bottom now we're going to go and take peach smoothie on my morphe be 36 my favorite pencil brush of all time you guys already know by now that it's like my obsession a bitch can't stop a bitch canceled for reals i'm gonna take my secretive and colbert mix again on the same brush and then put that starting on the outer corner and then i'm going to work it forward work a good link down and then we're going to take my morphe and 50 k which is a really tiny be lining brush and take that beauty mark shadow again and put that clothes to the lashline can really speak when I do this to really help darken the outer corner gonna take the next train shall lead black liner and take a little gel liner and I've actually been really liking this from my waterline I work all day makes the weekend so i really like yeah really black and like really creamy mhm I'm going to tight line my stew so i'm not going to win for this look I just don't feel like doing liner so I'm gonna use the same Treasury liner and line the interim amount but he doing this shit because when our rimmed on the bottom and rimmed on the top I love rimming me so this is what it should look like that i am going to finish the side real quick and I'll be right back he calls the top and the bottom of the eyes are done so i'm going to apply some false lashes already put like mascara on have my benefit roller lash on top and I'm a clash on bottom these two bitches you know these are my shit sound like you didn't hold a drill of the lesson with dara you know i'm going to apply my new bouncing Bella lashes because they're in stock right now so obviously a little lamb is what it looks like with the Bellamy's on hold waiting to see what the final looks like really up close she is look like what that looks like what it looks like come on man just fucking zoom in that was what I looks like you guys should definitely definitely definitely do eyeliner with this look you guys didn't do that more subtle ash I like really dramatic three lashes for me flashes like this elements and photos look super super super great because they're so flared out and crazy yeah if you don't want to changeup the little bit do you guys do you have minor and lashes whatever you want to do do it okay i'm going to finish the face on camera might overhear or queenless doing let's go ahead with some bullish on my face already kind of bronze out of us in topic is this exposure is kind of high because the lighting is kind of crazy in the room but there is a broader on my face i'm going to take one of the new blushes from to face the i will always love you blush of all the brushes that they came out with that I will always love you is my favorite one it is so fucking good I'd I'm going to take that money more pg8 this little blush brush ideas for blush i would use it on a more elite three brush but they're sold bellies are sold out i really want us to see another option from morphe which is another great option which is the g8 for blush it's so good it picks up product really nicely and the prophets really nice too and its intended this blush is like a golden peach it's so damn you guys get the chance go try it out in story it does give you a soft glimmering shimmer to the cheeks so if you guys have a lot of texture just be weary of that I mean I don't give a shit i love the blushes that have seen anyway but you guys are we ready guys don't like that then just be prepared for the fact that it does have a little bit of Sheen i love this freaking blush look at the blush on i'm going to go ahead and take my highlighter now i'm so excited to be using the Tyler it's champagne pot by becca which was in

moisture like it's not that I'm gonna go in with a step one base smoothing all over the rest of my face this because I do want to have primer on throughout the rest of my face and this one is really great for kind of texture and things like that so for foundation or what I'm going to go in with the estee lauder double wear this is like my tried-and-true foundation this one drives with that finishes stays on my face all day getting a full coverage I love this foundation I've changed 1w to sand and i'm going to use it with a damp beauty blender with five people were here last night huge now we're going with our time to dinner and its really press the foundation in all over the face there we go nice and full coverage to help me your full color child i'm going to go ahead and grab the mac pro longwear concealer and nw20 in order to put that on the under eye areas as well as a brand new who do you like my which commandment and i love this concealer it's beautiful bowl not only is it going to highlight me it's going to really help cover the darkness I have underneath my eye is not that I have a shade time I'm not much you don't like darkness but she does have some song I'm gonna use that beauty blender to really help blend it out more i look like a little girl that's fine and all come together to get off and now we're going to go in with the Smashbox comparing things but i did my haul video I a lot of people were like oh my god you have to use the contour sticks in that video so i was like your model thing i'm going to do it for anyone use the highlighting one for the under eye area the shooting thing about the highlight one is that I feel like it isn't having me enough I just don't feel like that's a lot of highly you know but you know it's still beautiful and still highlights it doesn't have as much as I wish it didn't but that on the forehead is about t-zone and then we're gonna put that out the be better as well at the end these conferences are sol blendable it's not even funny knee oh my gosh they are still vulnerable makes me sick ok now we're going to go in with the bronze color stick the reason I'm putting a base down first because you know we're going to probably want to stay on as long as you possibly can at least I do I know I do and so I think have the base down first will really help the longevity of which i'm gonna take the Beauty Blender and buff that and like they're blending out phone easily and it's making me and it felt good tell me that it's not gorgeous okay cause this is what it looks like with just the bronze stick on i think i look super pretty much time to look at more bronze and kind of glowing in getting us to mention when I look like such a ghost and now we're going to go in with the contour stick and this one we're going to be a little bit more precise with a stick and we're going to do right by the top of the ear and that's all we're gonna do is we're going to blend it out i don't want to be too hard with this one because ones as much more of a great toe into it and the bronze g one does the lighter with this one I think the better and i'm going to go ahead and use my g3 from morphe to really just gonna help blend that in i'm going to go with that beauty blender just kind of press over it just to give us a little diffusion got off the views to the same thing for him I'm going to take the laura mercier he's setting powder okay seriously this powder and a double life it really fucking is do it's so good and get me a map throughout the day i'm making a beautiful like airbrush finish i just love it so we're just going to go in really just pressing on the power over our faces underneath that I - can I don't forget that because he will create the creasing monster and don't forget your lids to because we did use the concealer as our base and now we describe a big fluffy brush just dust away and the actual card that might be there I'm going to finish are faced with the Kat Von D shade and light palette because i love this bad boy so much going to grab the highlight middle shade right here on a more fee and 438 like my kinda late rush of life and it's gonna really just press that in on top of the highlighted areas where we put the Smashbox contour stick the t-zone as well and then go for shits and giggles let's go ahead and put in mac emphasize highlighting sculpting powder just a little bit just to brighten it even more we really don't need to step but you know i'm a big ass directly not hard dimension hey I feel like I have to be quiet because people are like in my house like those like workers and shit and I'm like I'm not gonna be quiet I don't care where he continued with the shade light power we're gonna grab subconscious with the makeup geek rounded brush brush I use this brush all the time for contouring I just feel like it's perfect its precise it's easy towards the back of our ear and just use that as our contouring shade and just kind of buff it in we're not doing anything too precise this is just really going to ensure that we have it on a lot longer . the night or I mean we're going to probably going to say it's like I'm not about to be on down on the dance floor and my contours melting off like be her last time not me and cup those cheekbones your wish so we have our contour and highlight time we're going with some blush i'm going to take a makeup geeks where are you i think it's spelled out because it's literally huh spell about makeup geek blush which is the perfect PT pink I think it's so beautiful and we're gonna grab that on a morphine and 500 which is a big fluffy brush i wanna go to handle the blush so that's why I'm grabbing a big fluffy brush like this it's so pretty ok let's go on and they're going to go ahead and highlight we're going to use the makeup pro sculpting duo in the shade - this is seriously so beautiful like I think I really died we're going to describe the highlight shade on the bronze shade I feel like it's a little bit just to warm for me it's a little bit too orange and something wrong i love warm bronze and I love warm like contouring college I really do but I mean I can only go so far before I return are in charge cana I can't doing taking the more 501 and really loading that bitch up with the gold that all amazing with I mean not really but like kind of like it looks like a look wet you know so we have that base of our face done like the foundation promise i'm going to use the kat von d Lock and Load makeup setting missed I love this stuff continues right now I feel like I just need a little refresher has a smell the cucumber it's so let go into sephora spray the shot in the face and tell me that's like cucumber water you can't get the smell like that I love this shit ok so I'm going to do my brows off camera I feel like it takes a little while I can definitely do a brow routine video if you guys are interested in that but I'm just gonna do it off camera clicks I felt just going to be some time to be right back cool so we have the browse on I don't know why I've been feeling like I want to go more fleek lately I just feel like a strong i just feel like doing strong browse right now I don't know what it is I just do it because i do this and using bitches to fuck me when I do this you know we get to let our eyes so I'm gonna try my very best to recreate this look I do not remember exactly every single that used by grab colors i think i'm pretty sure i used so this is what I have had so please wish me luck on this i know you guys do because you guys want it I think I go ahead and zoom you guys in because I really want you guys to really focus on the eyes because this sighs look is a little bit more it's not hard to do but there's some steps there's a couple steps to it so I figure it'd be a lot easier for me to see you guys in first we're gonna go ahead and start with peaches and cream by making you guys know what my favorite transition shade of all time and I'm gonna take that on a Sigma e-40 blending brush and we're just toss that into the crease is our tradition so you don't need me to meet with it I just got a new signal 40 so I'm just like new and then I'm going to go ahead and actually take a sigma e55 which is a flat shader brush my morphe brushes are dirty you guys I'm sorry forgive me but they're all talking right now I mean I'm taking the Anasazi bling eyeshadow and i'm going to put that on my brow bone as my highlight already have like some concealer down there that I used to clean up my brow so we're just gonna really help set that ish in motion what am I saying idea and then we're gonna actually go in with Poppy by a good because well I were to take a very small amount of it and now we're going to talk into the crease with that same here 40 this is really gonna give us that warm you should have something like this it's nice warm transition shade we're gonna go in with mocha on a morphine and 43 and clean this point in time mocha by makeup geek and now we're going to kind of focus on the outer corner press into the outer corner to the crease a little bit we're really going to run into the crease about half way things are I am going with the e 40 and just blend that way it's really crucial to go in with the steps and just continue to blend with an e 40 or any kind of big fluffy brush I think it's really really really important that's what I'm doing kind of blend in transition now i'm going to go in with that same and 43 with make a geek corrupt so very tiny amount of it because it's very people to donate a lot and never to that concentrate on the outer corner and slightly bringing it up words into that papi not nearly as far as muckle though the same thing going without me 40 and blend out the black triangle with an e30 pencil brush by Sigma because i really want to really concentrate the Blackland like a CEO job like you can pay to blame there we go now we're going with the fun part of the lid color going to go in with a flat dense packing brush I'm going to use the sigma f 70 which is a dense packing brush I'm going with make a deep grand span and eyeshadow this color is literally life like actually literally life or really just pressing that on right up to the transition shades in my crease that shit real bright so actually I'm gonna go on my finger and take grandstand I finger and press that onto the lid I really wanted to be shine even more shiny the shadows are really great with your fingers because they give you this nice foil intensity like that then I want to take a more fee 326 and in the spotlight I make a geek now we're going to place on our inner corner as our highlight this shit highlights that motherfucker and so is what the top of the looks like they look so pretty oh my god yes other probably yeah Corner I'm gonna take mocha and mix it in with peaches and cream and we're going to take a more feet and 5 08 very tiny amazing brush getting underneath the lash line and they went on that a little bit and then we're going to grab mr. right now Dean pencil by the bomb which I've used before my channel I just really like it they're just going to blend out whatever is left underneath my waterline just kind of blend that out that's something like that yes okay so I'm gonna go finish there really quickly our camera in left that's about what i think of intercession real quick and i'll be your back and now we have both eyes completely done without the lashes and chin so I was going to put a mask on where i'm going to use the benefit roller lash mascara have been really obsessing over this mascara recently i used it for the first time in my one brand tutorial of benefit cosmetics and I used it this way but when my father is going to use it like with the early part putting down so I've done that and it really that makes a huge difference it really does like extend my lashes the whole much i love is my scrap movie ok so now that we have our master are going with blinking few lashes in the style Samantha which was created with Samantha from battle ash because I know she's like please look up she's friggin so sick and created a class together and they're beautiful up these are the ones i was wearing in that video i have a code leave your lashes you do get a safe ten percent off so you get if you guys are interested in folders so

pop image yeah let me go ahead and you guys in what they look like and those were the eyes so now we're going to the lips of your we're going with makes people neutral lip liner I'm i believe that they are in stock right now haha I beginning so many tweets and something that I like how you guys cannot find next to a neutral I'm sorry I i use this bitch so much is so funny because one of my

trust me it's so beautiful very light peachy pink satin color and I think it's so beautiful at the really goes well with this look because i just looked at eyes are like what's catching the attention of the peeps so you want to keep the lid much more subdued and she's really pretty and nude and very like Kim Kardashian you know ok but for those of you who are not interested in doing a very light nude pink let's go ahead to another option as well how many exfoliant lives right now because they're so bad huh and so the second option I think that would go really great with this look is very smoothie bye Dorcas makes it a little closer they just launched its not it was not a club with anyone but it's a beautiful rosy warm pink and i think its timing and this is very smooth if you're into much more of a still very neutral pink and you don't know so new beast or something you left that's really pretty and take your own color but prettier kind of thing listless it is so beautiful it's so beautiful oh I love it love it love it trust me i'm not trying to sell you guys on girard stuff because I mean they have lipsticks and they have glasses i do not like personally I don't talk about

at the babies in New York can't wait to see you guys hey guys so welcome back to my channel today's gonna be on how to smoke out your eyeliner and I think this is a this is such an easy look you guys it's so Universal it's so simple to do it just takes a couple steps their end result is so great and it looks good on absolutely everyone and so I really wanted to show you this I love you more likely to make up a height of my personal favorites video with what the deep plum red lip and say hey I wanted to go with this goes a little like live like you know that's what I can always do a tutorial using that lip as well he's going to see but this is that I look ahead in it and i wanted to show you guys how I did it because so many people requested me to do it so this is the look and so without further ado let's go into YouTube tutorial become i feel and i think my interests are so fucking long and I just want to get guys to that so let's start the shenanigans let us please so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna start off with some tape to be honest I'm not the biggest fan of using tape and makeup in general there's only two things that you before i use it for smoked outliner like this and i use it for glitter and we're getting the piece nothing too crazy and they're going to cut it in half so one piece goes on each eye and the reason I'm putting in habits so that I don't get so much like my foundation like ripped off because I foundation already usually you want to do this makeup before you make a point but I'm stupid that's what i'm doing is i'm sticking the two pieces that take on the back of my hand so we can take off the first layer of like stickiness it doesn't rip off our I when you're placing the tape what you want to do we're gonna grab the tape with both hands are going to line it right underneath be very careful with this please go right underneath the lashes at the corner of my eye you see that right there the reason we're going underneath our lashes because because we don't rip off our actual election please so now you have this nice straight line from the bottom lash line going all the way to your brow game which will stick that there and the part honestly this part does not not to be stuck this part is not to be stuck the part that really matters is this part right here this really needs to be against the skin so you can have that sharp crisp wine ok so first things first we're going to go in with our transition shape just how we go in with transitions were doing normal i look we're going with the transition for this as well for me i'm going to be going into it make a geek peaches and Kareem of gonna go with my green room and the luck see Beauty 207 brush which came in the genes makeup brush collection which is really is beautiful Gina did a great job with her brush collection i think they're absolutely amazing we're going to do is literally you're going to go with the beaches color and is already primed by the way shit is print gonna go in and we're going to really just feather that forward into the eye from our crease all the way in to about halfway through our eye on the lid to have the whole I want you want to have covered with the transition all the way out to the tape this brush is perfect because it's so fluffy it's not to attend it actually it's an angled brush on you can tell but its angle - it's really great diffusing from the top and much more dense towards the base boom to have a transition color down first and then we're going to transition again we're going to be using a massage early Hills color and fun  i'm using this color fun is because I wanted to be a very neutral look I don't want to be too what I don't want to be too cool and now we're gonna grab 10 more feet and 4 33 which is I've talked about this many times one of my favorite brushes and then we're going to take just a little bit lower closing are again taking on the lower - all shadows are so amazing so soft soap into it and this one we're going to just take about half way down the eye and into the crease as well and outwards and we're just putting on that a little bit lower than that beaches color and then i'll just go back in with that original Russian you want it that looks brush just kind of blend everything together i'm a freak about transitions I need them to be completely completely effortless I do not like seeing any hard lines at all it's one of the biggest piece so I really like having some very diffused easy transition to apply a little bit more fun towards the base like that so she looks something like this so when you're looking down the most pigment on the outer corner and it transitions outwards from here about two huge can see that feeding into lightness now we're going to go in with making be corrupt shadow which is probably the black as I have ever ever ever use its five dollars like are you kidding it's so amazing and we're also going to go in with a pencil brush from you because well it's actually one of the best brushes for tight lining and for detailed work that I've ever used and make a history ever so we're going with that which is a little bit of brush you don't need a lot correct because the corruption was extremely extremely extremely pigmented so just pick up a little on the brush and now we're going to go even lower than fun now we're going to run by our lashes about half way and pick up a little bit more product if you need somewhere and that we're going to run along the tape about where natural crease is about it go so we're going to go up to right there going to kind of bring it down here as well we want to be extremely extremely black by the lash line so really just packing it on my last night and the lighter pressure going upward nothing that blacked out i'm going to go in with another clean blending brush I don't want to have any other product on it and with the makeup geek Bible underbrush which looks like this it's a little angled brush and now we're really going to just bust in that black with the into the fun you don't need me - this just blend your little heart away because you have to take their kind of foolproof this way now we're just kind of taking it out words it's just one of those looks at its kind of laborious because you have a kind of a lot of steps to do this but honestly like the finished product is so worth it look see how fast that was blended out like this is why it's so extremely crucial to have those transition colors down first because it makes everything so much faster and everything much more smooth and so now we have let it out i'm going to go back in with a little bit more correct we really really really really want to be dark as possible look something like this so you can see some eyeliner is very diffused and very blended i just noticed that i took it farther than i wanted to take it the black I wanted to go about halfway not really necessarily like three fourths of the way so i'm actually gonna fix that a little bit so what I decided to do is I decided to grab a big shading kind of brush and I grabbed my mistake color so for example if I want to kind of a race a shadow or kind of diffuse it out even more I would color that night like to call it like my race color and for me it's vanilla bean I make a gate when I mean by race I basically means i'm gonna load up this vanilla bean color I'm going to pack it onto the lid very lightly and blend it outwards in to the shadows and as you can see right there it's trying to diffuse out even more and that's kind of what I wanted to happen I didn't want my black to be so far in so i'll grab this vanilla bean and i'll take it and run it over the black to give it a nice lighter diffused look see that now gently not gone it's not a race like home saying but it's definitely a lot less pigmented a lot less intense and then I'm just gonna go back in without black not just vanilla bean on my brow bone as well isn't this nice bone white shadow it's not too intense it's a little slight slight slight sheen to it it's nothing too heavy at all and those are my kind of happened cuz i'm not really the biggest fan of those intense brown highlights a lot of people are they love them at the bottom is not one of those people so now that we have everything diffuse and blend it I'm gonna take off the team carefully to get me this wing out shadow liner and the cool thing about liner like this is that if you are like me and you have like a hood here that wants to fall on your lid wasn't going to transfer at all because it's a shadow it's not an actual liner so you get a nice definition on the outer corner of the eye but it's not gonna transfer you and this is why I don't like doing that tape methods because it removes my foundation and concealer so what we can do to fix that grab any concealer brush like the consumer brush that you used earlier like today and I'll grab it and I'm just gonna run it over that spot with the tape to kind of just diffuse out fact that there was a hard line there this will just help me really buff it out this is the morphe m35 one of my favorite concealer brushes of all time I talked about this in my December favorites video it's absolutely amazing and it's a while do is just kind of buff out the line and look see not nearly as intense and that's crazy as it was before ok so I'm going to go outside real quick and i will be right back my little darling ok so now we have the tops of both sides done they look like this honestly they're not completely 100000% symmetrical but it honestly does not matter that much to really to be honest like as long as you get it symmetrical as you possibly can no one can fault you for trying this is even as I'm gonna get for right now yeah so just don't don't fret if you guys don't get it completely even for the first time it's one of those things that just takes a learning curve especially be doing it for the first time so don't give up on it because I need you guys to do it you fucking give up on me take care so now we're doing the bottom lash line we're not going to do really much the bottom much like that off when I do a liner like this I like to keep my bottom lash line is clean and clear as possible ok Richard's gonna come here to me they are going to grab that same making Gibby brush and whatever we have left on this brush we're just gonna run it on the lower lash line barely like barely fucking just the outer corner only do a little somethin somethin right there not too much though I'll take that about a thirty percent in how meaning that they're just gonna blend that I really just don't want anything too hard shell here and i'll just buff it out with whatever we have left on that more of you brush the m4 33 look something like this it's not too intense on the outer corner but you have a little bit of definition and I want to keep the definition solely on the outer corners that's we really just want to keep it on the outer side right now ok so it's gonna put a quick coat of mascara on this is the Too Faced better than sex better the thing sign the thing my lashes are so ugly inside of money put a little on the bottom to carefully who's texting me you know what that's enough I'm consider myself lucky right now with them out i have on so much so now we're going to go in with lashes we're going to go in with the blinking you number four which are these because we're really focusing all the attention on the outer corner we're going in with these glasses because they flare out at the end of you guys can tell a flare I get so much about you taking out things for a quick little coat of duo like to have any not too heavily but that's why I watched into the woods tonight with my friends and i am like so in musical motor i know it's I'm so much and like plane home I just wanted like to bust out and sing and dance and the game you know look down but the lashes on lockdown place them the blinking butte lashes go sleep from dying mama Slade she's done how to teach her pot is full slate so we have one lash on let's go into the lash on the other side oh my gosh if this mirror doesn't open I have a lecture on hand I'm here and I want to open the other eye roll the world yes lashes yes number fours give it to me hard ok now my lashes on let me just go ahead and zoom you guys in to the final I look yes so that was in for the final I like that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video hopefully you guys learned something from it i really enjoyed making this for you guys um I think that this look is so easy so universal anyone can do it to work for all different shapes of eyes and it's just one of those things where it's like dude everyone will look good in there ok oh and just get people are wondering i'm going to be a girl like to beauty matte lip paint in Starling that's the lip color when I know this is actually my favorite colors of the moment I have got the same expo I really like using I completely fell in love with it all over again it's almost like whole day crafts drive it whenever you in my life I would check out the girl actively paints they are absolutely amazing other one of the best i've ever tried ever and liquid lipstick for and one more thing one more thing so a company / app hit me up and they came and we love your videos where a new app we're just starting out we would love for you to talk about in your videos and I'm like you're in happen you're gonna have to talk about your app on my videos i'm a beauty channel like that makes no sense to me so I was just kind of blew it off and I'll just like you want to know like that's so weird like want to talk about your app on my channel that operate so I just basically didn't reply and I'm sorry I'm sorry to you guys for not replying first time it's because I just didn't see how to play my channel they hit me up again okay we applied to beauty in the beauty world and I was like you do no phone it's basically gonna get online closet that makes sense it's called snaps and the reason i thought i could be applied to us if you guys are interested in this kind of thing because this used to happen to me back all the time where someone would come in and they would forget their color they will forget what I shows they had they would forget literally like everything like i'm going to have a ring on my god i'm not in the system i don't know basically this app kind of prevents that the app stores and like your little make-up file and click ok cool this is like the makeup that you have this is the name of edges in case you might forget anything you can make it private you can make a public you can show people you have your people you don't have it just it doesn't matter i know that i'm i'm not gonna go into too much detail about that necessarily i just wanna let you guys know about it if you guys do have problems with remembering items while you're out shopping and you're like I don't know if I have this already like what I can do and my color forgot it so if you're interested submit that go check it out I'm it's called snaps again understand you guys know because snaps was kind to me they said all these wonderful things and I know what it's like to start on start fresh and starting you know what everyone starts somewhere like it's not fair for me to just be able to accept makeup you know it's not fair for me to just accept makeup and just talk about me up all the time at all times and not give other brands or other companies or any other anything a chance to talk to be talked about you know and so everyone starts there you know what I mean like I only grew in my channels and that is because people talked about me and people grill me and help me they lifted me up so why what I did not - app because they're a nap you don't mean so hopefully you guys do great snaps on if you guys are interested in an appt like that go check them out if you aren't totally all good this is still make a channel it's not gonna be for everyone it's a smartphone app so I just let you guys know if you guys are interested something like that if not then please

now at all i'm gonna do a full face video today i'm gonna take the dr brandt pores no more and that's gonna go on the center of my face and blending out words I just really really enjoy this primer a lot because it's so good at keeping the orderliness of my face at bay and you guys know I'm oily as a fuck in oil truck comin I'm going with the new foundation today I'm gonna be taking it the cogiendo high definition and makeup foundation I've never tried the foundation it's kind of awkward foundation in the shade one two three shit I have thank you so much how to coach you know for sending this to me they sent me this foundation and they sent me this color soho let's hope and pray that it's the right color I'm going to take it out on a morphine for 39 of course whenever having more voluminous aqua foundation i like to go into more of a dense brush because it won't soak up as much product as a Beauty Blender will nice color matching skills guys nice color managing the color is actually very accurate my face it just lighter than what i like to do you guys know mom wants to beat earnest but this is a beautiful finish like beautiful and it's very building was you can see it does build up very very nicely it's not as full coverage they want but i'm going to wait for full coverage of today like more of a natural look so I like it I want to go pretty lightweight with the consumer will be taking the urban decay naked skin concealer gorgeous concealer i love this one it's full coverage it's lightweight honestly I don't really have any qualms with this concealer and I never have so I really went for a really nice fresh look today not super crazy not to pretend super drag like I like to do you usually just a little more brightness I'm gonna have this the dandelion shy beam by then if it just a little bit just to add some more brightness I'm just going to put that in just the right in and awake in the look oh go ahead and set the concealer and taking the laura mercier translucent and just lightly going over be concealed and brightened areas just going to want to increase its happening my interface we're gonna take the naked skin Urban Decay ultra definitions powder every time they say that that is do much for me and soon as likely set the entire face with this this is a nice HD powder it's not as heavy as laura mercier one but it is a beautiful setting powder to set the face and it is an HD finish so it's going to be you too full and it's not going to be too heavy it's gonna be just enough taking some mac studio fix powder and take that neck just to match up the face a little bit you guys don't want to be two tone I mean I like to leave the dual chrome to the shadows . to the face come on let's match up here ok now taking some trustee hoola bronzer you guys already know I went through this phase right now where it's like only hoola bronzer and markets bronzer I like I'm not use any other brothers besides those because I just fell in love with I'm just gonna brought up the temples a little bit who is such a pretty color it's like such a natural bronzer it really does look like your likes uncased rather than being so like orange or gray it's just like such a good neutral color I love this problem where I always have not fucking spot on my face that doesn't take pic map I tried like blow a bubble to make it get in there and it just doesn't work doesn't fucking work let's do a bit of no snatching it's real quick i'm going to take the morphe 28 and the makeup geek cool porcelain contour powder and we start contouring the nose slightly just to give me a nice skin to know to put on too much more rounds around the nose and now it looks like i just snorted shit to concentrate for the nose contouring you can go south so quick we're going to cook the roast to make it look decent because i feel i'm looking a little cracky okay to kill our mercier translucent setting powder on a more feet and 45 heat cook the side of the nose to make it look sharper going to let that rest for a moment and just cook into the nose and i'm still on the bottom of the browser as well just a very tiny amount because i don't want to be to confer today I'm going to more of a natural i mean naturally you're going to get for me i'm going to go into my e49 brush my morphe just a little taper little cute with brush and I'm going to the local - hacia the back locate because i was studying my tip into bubbly and sunburst these two sides with like two top ones right here and dip into both of those start highlighting the bug do the bloke it's like ridiculous that locates are so fucking yeah this is why they are my favorites we have my back a while Tony 453 blend between the bronzer and highlighter Becca wild honey and mac warm soul top two blushes of literally all time and I like this one because it's more about burnt apricot color and which is great for more of a bronzy look it's not super like blushy it's a very just pretty bronzy natural blush color going to brush away the little nose contouring the funny thing about nose contouring sometimes you can beat the bitch fucking into the ground chisel her down to nothing to a toothpick and sometimes you have bad days and today is not my day okay so it's not right there with the nose we're gonna move on or you move on to the eyes the faces done I call it looks I think looks very pretty bronzy glowing and now it's a lot to the case so basically just fuck my life I finished filming the entire I look thinking it was on camera of course see if I care of course and turns out I didn't feel any of it those the off the entire time mhm mhm so how to wipe off one is I could show you guys what to do huh so let's go to start this one work back in time I'm gonna take the mac pro longwear concealer going to prime my lids with this concealer actually learn this trick from Jaclyn hill and the olden days when I watched your old videos should actually use a pro longwear concealer all the time as a primer on her eyes and I started you can get a maximum like I'm trying to wait like what John is talking about when i was working out and it worked really really well so I'm like you know what to do that again around mayo and so again right now so sure - Jacqueline again I came back at it again with the fucking tips and tricks this look is so freaking easy guys so like I'm not even that mad I didn't do it on camera back and we created very very easily I'm gonna be taking my man anyway and makeup geek palette today look at this little bastard is only fucking good I feel toward the fuck up because my mom was abused do i'm using this part today because I told you guys also try to incorporate this part as much as I can and tutorials for those of you guys who did get it and those you guys will want to get it you guys can definitely create so many different looks with this palette which is why I want to do as many as I possibly can that makes sense we're gonna go in with beaches and cream nice just be easy transition color absolutely love this color so much we'll get that into the lid with the morphe 27 rush next we're gonna take a scrap paper which is a nice beautiful maple brown tone on a morphine for 33 that's gonna go on the outer corner of our I very much only on the outer corner and the powder third of the eye as well it's just gonna kind of trick the eye to give us more uplifted look on the outer corner when we do shadows out here that's what we're doing I'm just running out here not going too far in and breathing out with the e 27 just to make sure there's no harsh lines and edges you guys this looks so simple but that's kind of what I wanted it to be I want to be a nice pretty simple everyday look that you can do in your fucking sleep basically so next thing is we're going to go in with the morphe 32 and Artemis shadow it's a really pretty yellow champagne shade that's going to go all over the lid as are really pretty bright intense lip color luckily because it does have that nice golden undertone it's gonna look so nice on so many different tones even if you're darker complexion it will look a beautiful shimmering highlight color then taking that same and 43 with no additional product blending out the edges of Artemis just make sure there's no harsh lines and that is it for the top of the is super easy super simple just a pretty natural glow EULA been taking a more 4036 brush and mixing it with peaches and cream and Sora that's gonna be ran underneath the lower lash line just give me a little bit of definition on the lower lash line I don't like it when it's completely bare I just think I look really weird when I don't put a little bit of something down there I don't know I'm just like really weird about that are any of you guys worried about that like you guys have to push out those on the lower lash line or not just mean because I really I do I don't know why I just do and then we're going to take a little bit more of artemis and that's going to go on the brow bone to make sure we have a nice glowy effect like i was saying earlier and on the inner corner of quarters already technically curl the left at the end of mascara on them so they look fucking wonky as hell sorry about it because i had a wipe off the makeup I did that benefit roller lash on the top and I did not extend my google backlash on the bottom and also one more thing I forgot to do on this either already done this I i took the new aqua xli pencil by Makeup Forever they did a club with charli XCX dancer named and i'm going to take the yellow shade i'm gonna put that on the lower lash line on the lower waterline yellow is a brightening color it's a very very illuminating and awakening color so I'm very intrigued by doing a yellow pencil on the waterline I kind of like it so that's it for that I look I really think it's absolutely stunning you guys to keep it at this and be good to go but it's not a man you a tutorial without some lashes so I'm gonna put on a pair of lashes really quickly and i'll be right and once you put on a pair of serengeti lashes by a new bounce some this is what the look should look like I absolutely love these lashes let me go into any guys in to see what I look like up close great so now that we have the face completely done and eyes are already done as well i'm going to go ahead and do with the lips now i'm gonna do is just nice very pretty and natural it i'm gonna take the next peak of the neutral lip liner I think it's definitely time for me to get a new one yeah just such a good lip liner like good everyday lip liner friggin three dollars the drugstore just so good and if it's going to be going in with the Rimmel London Kate lipstick in the shade 42 I've never tried this before but it looks beautiful and I saw it I was like this new the color looks stunning let's try it out boat bitch it's all good they're just a really beautiful like creamy finish lipstick i think this is studying holy shit their good looks I might want to do a little bit of a gloss my well I'm taking the markets gloss in the shade French tickler and this is the final look you need to make it big and that is it for the entire video i hope you guys enjoyed today's video had so much fun creating this for you guys I love doing a natural glam you know i'm i'm into doing like full-blown full coverage like winged out insane this but also really into doing natural glad for the everyday person that wants to just be natural today without being like to intensive

different and do some color I haven't done anything like colorful colorful wise in a while so I thought why not incorporate green all I like smokey eye it's still incorporating color but it's still so fall appropriate and so beautiful and I think that this look turned out really really nicely for games like if you see any kind of like cracking in my face my eyes and my nose got really really really really running throughout this video because i want my allergies are starting to act up really badly and so I just couldn't stop anything like all my offices were just leaking I just sounds so fucking gross I look like kind of like a disaster right now I apologize i try to get through the tutorial as quick as I possibly could so that I wouldn't like be a gross mess be other than that you guys know

I want to do kind of like a get ready with me style so yeah we're just going to go ahead and start doing the whole entire face let's start this bitch let's get started we're going to take the mineral primer veil by our class I haven't actually used on camera before but I used it a couple times actually like this primary uses when a couple times that's really nice oily skin feels really really nice expensive as hell though oh my god it's so expensive it doesn't give me like that silicone feeling and it doesn't fill in my pores like I wish that they were fills in but mama has big course so I like to cover that shit but that does not happen with these primer for foundation for taking the l oreal prom at infallible which is my father gave baby i'm gonna shade one of three natural buff I'm running out of this being severely and that was gonna put that on the t-zone with the Beauty Blender and damp Beauty Blender percent of the t-zone this foundation is just so good at it from the drugstore for cheap it was so good i put it mainly in the t-zone that that's right the most oily and this is more of a mattifying oil controlling foundation t-zone covered in the formation and everything else is left bare for the rest of this I'm gonna be going in with the makeup ever Ultra HD stick i use in my makeup forever tutorial will show you how to cover up the rest of my face mostly on the cheeks with the stick this is like a full coverage foundation that gives you more of a natural finish I'm gonna put that on the parameters of my face the reason I'm avoiding the t-zone is because this does not help prevent my oil whatsoever i gets the oily as hell want to use this mix and match people mix and match for whatever you need and years to perfect now my base is based on an extra concealer we're going to conceal these fucking bags back too bad they're not Chanel because I'm gonna take the Maybelline master class in the shade light I'm gonna take that underneath my highest is gonna go right from the tube I love this concealer i'm also going to have it with it as well it's just so good it's like full coverage super brightening but you need to say extremely fast like you can't like weight to set it because it will kind of get crazy and I'm gonna mix that with the map Prime in light boost just give me some more brightness underneath the eye you know - like to be highlighted to death and the beauty butter it out again and then taking my trusty bareminerals all arrested powder on am or PM 438 i'm going to just run that over my I just kind of set everything i'm so well rested add that is a huge difference in connection to look at this brightness and happiness and awakeness and look at that luggage it sleepy now for the highlight I'm gonna go in with just like a creepy way before I go in with powder ones later I haven't found my face or anything like that yet but I'm gonna take these you a champagne highlighter i just got this recently and I haven't tried it yet so I'm just gonna try it and I'm gonna use my ring finger and just kind of press that over usual highlights go it's a very pretty glowy Rosie champagne tone that's right natural this like by itself is very natural thing just gives you more like a glow from within actually really quite stunning wow very beautiful breast milk powder my face just because i wanted to get that face done and beaten to death and it's pretty beat I'm gonna take the mac mineralize skinfinish in medium with my morphe g0 you guys know the drill with this is my favorite brush my favorite powder brush of life I love the mac mineralize skinfinish powder delivery gives you like a skin finish I think it's absolutely beautiful and they give you the most natural-looking powder finish even if you're dry like I

i'm going to go ahead and bronze up the face using hoola i love hoola bronzer phone work and login good i think i want to do like a snapchat Q&A I think a lot of people have been doing like snapchat q and A's and like they've been going around for like a while now and people are doing them but i don't know if people want to look at people want to see that do you want to see snapchat Q&A to the Q&A like couple weeks ago that's the problem maybe I can do one like in a couple months are like a couple weeks when I my other Q&A is not so fresh I don't know what you guys think ok so this is the thing a lot of people always ask me like many why cant i send you any steps the reason you became semi snap is going to have its such a private to like people are only friends with can send me snaps and the reason is because i get a lot of snap views ok so when you get a lot of snap views and you have your snap set to public your snapchat will usually freeze because you're getting a lot of snapchats you know so that's kind of what the reason why I hey I haven't been able to really put it on the public because of my snapchat will freeze and I can't snap chat look it's not trying to like figure their shit out if you only does not sound promising in bronze and Rome how this video's not too long I just like I'm talking I'm very talkative today I just want to like talk to you guys more so forgetting to home forgive me i'm going with some blush i'm gonna take my morphe three brush and video blush by urban decay and never tried any of their blushes I just got someone recently and I really wanted to try it out that's pretty good so nice like it's like a flush color to the rose pink rose pink there we go on like what the fuck are you ok so now i'm going to shade and light palette by Kat Von D I'm gonna take my favorite like contouring brush now of all time then make a geek chisel cheek brush basically this brush and take the shape this brush has really rebound by contouring who is calling me the reason why i love this brush the bristles are extremely soft and the length of them is perfect it's a it is the perfect brush basically okay so you guys know like about the heater brush than ours eat it's a really extremely popular brush that is used for like bronzing and contouring right I have the heater brush and I really don't like it talked about my channel before like that i don't like the nausea , see when i first tried i was expecting something like life-changing I thought was gonna be amazing and i only got it cannot wait to try this out hated it like I litigated and also what the fuck why do I hate this brush you know finally realized that the bristles were just not the kind of bristle I like I don't like tough bristles like that it was a really tough for me to use so whenever you see this brush this is exactly everything I wanted from the EDA like that's why i like this so much i feel like this brush has like really rebound to my contouring game because it's just so ridiculously soft it's so good honestly I don't even know what to say about it like without looking like a cheese ball but it's seriously amazing because almost done now i'm going to highlight for reals like on top of my house later I'm so excited to finally be able to use this on camera because they're actually out now I felt so bad using before this is the Anasazi is so Hollywood highlighter i've been using these highlights of the past couple months and i am obsessed I'm gonna take my morphine and 510 brush and just get right into it and start highlighting with it i'm obsessed maybe I was a little too much oh my god I was like why is looking so crazy right now but i just realized i have cream highlighter underneath its type on a little bit of that out perfect so we have the base of the face completely blew me just a little bit nose contouring I've been really into nose contouring lately I don't know why it's just been like something I've been wanting to do but i've been using this little makeup geek brush I'm using this low shade over here dusting off a very little better when he's a very small amount of it and just been kind of contouring my nose with this brush is very very very lightly like nothing too crazy because I don't like to do a heavy nose contour I feel like it could mean you look real like fucked up real quick but this brush is pretty freaking perfect for a nose contour kit it's so thin but like the bristles are so nice like they're just so good boom with that snatch knows do you think that was like 30 seconds or so now that we're done with the face we're going to do the eyes now and let's go ahead and get ready for that I so I done in July balls so we can focus on the boys so we can finish the ice I don't know how I don't know why I suddenly going to accent sometimes I just do i'm really weird i love accents for some reason I just really - already filled in my brows off of camera and i already put on my primer by using Smashbox 24-hour as always it's the best one I've ever used for oily lids if you have greasy late it's the best primer I'm not getting started going to some shades now this is my color I'm going to work with I want to do like something like different something more colorful than usual so wish me luck because i feel like i do neutrals very well but I don't do color super super well all the time for she was I don't ever work with like green and take a mixture of beaches and cream hand this beautiful warm orange shade that shall not be named I'm gonna put that in the crease with a morphy 27 brush just go into the crease it is such a gorgeous like warm transition I want it to be really warm in the crease I think that's really great when you're doing like colorful things on the lid like I love to do a nice warm transition shade just kind of tie everything together that makes sense that see this nice beautiful warm a warm crease so now i'm going to go in with dirty martini by makeup geek and i'm going with that on a morphine and 43 and it's just a really nice olive green shade it's very very pretty i'm gonna be putting that on the outer corner and into the crease lower than we have that nice warm transition shade I'm taking out all the way into the front of the I just nice light motions flipping the brush upwards to put it into the warm crease perfect so now I'm just going with a black base i'm gonna be using the morphe gel liner in slate it is a really nice just black eyeliner but i'm gonna use it as my base today I want to go to more of a smoky look I've decided so we take a little bit on a morphine ether t2 packing brush and I'm going to run that on the lid close to the lash line it's so black and so creamy it's the oh it's so good all the way up to that dirty martini color as soon as i'm getting higher and higher i'm using lighter pressure and blending downwards so i can have a nice little blend we have a nice black bass down looks look alive uh-huh I'm gonna grab a mixture of high tea and dirty martini on this just sigma e30 two brushes like a nice just packing brush I'm going to pack that on the entire lid to give me a nice green olive green base I'm using the black bass down first cuz i like the way that a black base gives you dimension for this kind of color it just it makes it look so beautiful I'm taking that right up to the dirty martini color just concentrate on packing on the color which is something like this it's nice green all of shade and we're going to take that for three again and then mix dirty martini and high tea on the brush and just go into that crease and just blend away in to the warm orange shade that we have going on I was like so nervous to do this - I'm like fucking all of green smokey eye with a little i think i am I think I'll go back in without a nice warm shade with peaches and cream mix just kind of go over the edge is still slightly I still wanted to be really warm and I want to try to lose any of that warmth in the crease because i don't like it to be too cool tone or two green I guess you could say i want to have some nice depth and dimension and he doesn't like this so far Yeah Yeahs perfect together both of the tops of the thighs done it's nice and blended I think it looks really really nice and I feel like it looks very festive it's very different for me i don't really ever do like green or blue or things like that but i really want to start venturing out into the world and i think it looks really beautiful especially with that like nice orangi warm transition and like a nice dark lid i love it I love it I love it I love it we're going to be taking the tart inner rim liner is just like a black eyeliner and I'm going to line the waterline this is where this is like one of the creepiest liners I've ever freaking trying it is so creamy and then tight line as well so it's going to take a little bit of the black along the lash line make sure you call your lashes to with the eyeliner if you want any like a little like missing like skin spots you know I know it looks really Jenky as hell but that's okay because we're gonna pick set so now i'm taking morphine and 508 i use as much all the time i was going to smudge out the top liner is very very creamy so buns up really easily and now course we need to be going over it with green again I'm gonna take a mixture again a dirty martini and high tea i'm using my 36 and blend that over the black I want to be exactly the same as it is on the top and this will take a little bit of time just to cover all the black and then take that nice orange shade again and then go ahead and blend out that dirty martini adjust some nice warm to give it more dimension not make it look so harsh and start you know to me ok so basically i had to like turn off the camera because my eyes were going crazy like i might already started acting really bad no sorry running really bad in my eyes are watering so right now i have a spot in my high that it will not take liner so I'm just gonna skip past I mean I've been waiting for like 10 minutes to like let it like subside so i can put eyeliner there but it just will not take whatsoever it's too watery so I'm just gonna have to deal with it for now I'm just shit happens I went ahead and applied mascara off Karen just cuz I didn't know like what the fuck expect this I so i did that on camera I'm going to play some lashes because its eyes is much more smoking intense i'm going to be using my bella lashes from new band from these lashes kill me they just make everything so much better than what it was originally basically i tried to do this last step but I'm gonna take shimma shimma as my highlight on am or PM 3267 put on inner corner of my eyes it's really brighten it up I whatever being really Ted smoky eye I want to go really heavy with the highly on the inner corner and the eyes just like you like it really it really brings it look together a little bit on the brow bone as well just a smidgen and now the eyes are officially complete i'm going to begin to see what they look like yeah vehicles not that I said dad I'm going to go ahead and do the lips I'm gonna take carbon decay glide on pencil and start naked which is a nice nude lipliner i love their bacon lip liner so i'm going to use that to live line he's going on so good I'm gonna feel have to live in with it and then I'm gonna take dose of colors the lipstick in San this is from there Tara collection i think they're permanent now I'm not really sure but I want to go to more of a cool tone lift I'm gonna take this bad boy and put it on my lips it's very nude because I look so dramatic i wanted to go really nude on the lip stain is almost concealer and that is the final look this is everything and yeah that's it

because I have been literally got nothing on the three weeks so I really want to start getting into it just jump right in and film with every thinks I'm not a lot of you guys do tell me that guys like to see more full face videos rather than just let me do my eyes are like one particular things so I'm just listening to you guys more than doing what you guys asked me i am your fucking slave first things first I'm going private with you make it four ever step one step one skin equalizer base in smoothing literally you can see that I've had some lovin Pat it on my nose and on the center of my face and it really does conceal the appearance of my pores and when i'm going to make up all day it just like looks nice it looks really really nice and it helps with my oil a little bit as well because it is a smoothing silicon e primary great for the center of the face i'm not going with the lorry ella no Matt and fallible you guys know that one of my favorite foundations honestly it's just such a good foundation and yes to the drugstore and 8 bucks I'm gonna put that on the t-zone with the burner awesome romance novel is in the center and then for the rest of the face i'm going to go in with the do your air flash foundation my favorite foundation of all time this is literally number one foundation for me you really can't go wrong I swear to such a beautiful foundation i'm going to use the shape 300 for my face it is not my shade I do know that it does a little bit darker but no fucks given I'm just gonna bounce that in with the view under usually I'll take this foundation on a like flat top kabuki brush or something like that but I just been using it with the Beauty Blender recently and I noticed that my skin has been looking so fucking be like so nice with a Beauty Blender when im using it just I don't know I feel like I'm really working the foundation into my skin like really just pressing it in working it in and I've noticed that it really does make a difference when im using it with a blender rather than aim laptop the bookie but I'm either way both work great awesome stuff we can see that I'm gonna be going in with two colors from the naked wait list can see their line from urban decay I'm gonna be taking the shades light neutral and shades fair neutral and i just--literally i just love these considers soul much it's just beautiful like full coverage consistency it's like light weight to it is that the weirdest thing I don't know how to explain the consistency of this can see that but it's just so nice so first I'm going with the darker one closest to my eyes because it has more pink undertone so take the lighter one and put that lower than the other concealer and it's going to start blending out with the Beauty Blender know that we already used before so I think it's been I feel like I've been gone for so fucking long which I really have been i've been gone for three weeks  21 days I've been gone that's so long i'm filming in 21 days what I really have filled with Jeffrey present rolls-royce video which was so fun to do he's gonna be doing a new series on his channel called like a rolls-royce get ready and I think it's a freaking genius idea so that was really fun by having feelings like at home or for my own channel and literally like three weeks the funny thing too is I still have like two videos i have three films that have you put up yet so I'm going to bring those up very very soon I just like to really film when i get right back home because I feel like I forgot how to film so i need to get into it you know so I'm gonna take the laura mercier translucent setting powder and this be 8 brush and just set the under eye and for the rest of this i'm going to take the ultra definition of loose powder by urban decay on b.e.t morphe brush and just set that all over the damn face just to set everything make sure nothing is going to be moving around I think it's absolutely beautiful it gives you like HD finish and when you're going for you too honey HD is what mama lon ok and I'd like to concentrate on the edges of my face and then I kind of bring it in because this is a shade of a little darker than me already went with the darker and make sure that i need to go to the dark about or do I don't think it do not neglect the neck because you already know just don't do it I really don't like to take liquids and very often liquid foundation like to take powders on my neck to match everything because if you like it so much faster and easier and I don't know the locals are just so weird eleniak don't like it I'll do it sometimes but not too often let's go ahead and highlight the under is really quickly with the market since to mark powders my favorite dry powder it's absolutely stunning with the same 0 brush you got this powder it works so so good like fuck me sideways with a chainsaw you know it's not too too yellow and I looks yellow in the pan it doesn't come off like yellow you know what i mean so if you ever want a nice powder for the under eyes i know i've talked about it in a favorites video before try the instant mark now for the rest of the face i'm so excited to use this piranha she gave that to benefit recently released this palette call sheet on and if you guys didn't know or follow me on social media I am actually on the condola inside the floor with Patrick and Kathleen were literally like the models of this product on the benefit concert is just so cool I just mean so much to me that benefit like took the chance on me and Patrick and Kathleen and allowed us to be inside 24 with them and it's just such a cool experience like not many like beauty bloggers can say that there insects for you know what i mean so thank you so much benefit you guys are seriously amazing this is fucking bomb the fact you guys did this I can meet five full-size box of powders dandelion who love rocket or dallas core least that you get a little brush a little brushy

used to look at it it's so pretty and even the support website you'll see me and Patrick and Kathleen on the site with Judith on so just so cool i'm so excited to be using this this launch attacks a forward while being on time we've got a film with it or anything so this is like my first time coming with that and I just think it's absolutely freaking sick I'm gonna take the e to brush and hula just dip right into who are brought up the skin you guys know who loves and I who and I go way I can pack cool let's just meant for everyone really at this point I'm gonna run that all over the place because it is a browser now they're all bronze up with well I just want to look so bronzy I just love love love is such a good project is now level up and I'm gonna take the rocket or shade over here just like a nice satin really pretty blush I'm gonna run the on the cheeks with my morphe three brush hope you guys can hear anything because the neighbors are playing such a loud ass music it's like so loudly guys come here I just close my window hopefully that'll work a little better apologize you guys in here in the background but I really can't do much about it so we have this face on i'm going to highlight a little bit too infrequent the head how do you guys use this tell me you guys have the sleek solstice palette it is one of the most intensely highlighting bright highlighting how they never use every jacket was the first 1i think to talk about this on her snapchat and she said was like the one of the most being highly she's ever ever tried and I'm sure tons of people without a body right after her and I was one of them I literally saw that and I was like oh um I need it I'm taking this little kid right here this is a highlight that's like really really brighten really intense so if you're the average person that doesn't like a bright and intense highlight work you can literally stuck in cause accidents I am the LA so I think Jackson really started a trend here with this bright-ass highlight and let's all think of right now I think Jacqueline hope for this highly because i don't think i've ever had highlighted this bright in my entire life so good and I think we're done with the face it's all about to the eyes now okay so I went and I did my eyebrows off of camera you wanna see me do i update a brow routine let me know in the comments box below and I'll definitely get that done for you guys but I've been liking this more full heavy route I'm so excited using this to affect things like an exciting video because i'm using like things I haven't tried yet this is the new jeffree star beauty killer palette and I have it today to try out for you guys that's the packaging come on now oh ok cool just slay my fucking all existence why don't you I'm going to take my morphe 27 and I'm very very very light layer of Courtney which is a nice just like pretty neutral brown crease shade and that's gonna go into the crease very lightly this in your transition machine I'm not to put a lot of it at all though - I system shade because i don't want it to be too intense but i do want to have something that people blend into because I'm an idea of what I want to do today and it involves the pink so we can take a little bit of this color there we go very very just soft nice easy transition and then I'm going with more p.m. for 33 and I'm gonna take this shade star power which is like a bright ass ping shan that's gonna go into the crease I feel like I want to do like a nice pink crease white lid blue under I just very very Barbie kind of look and I know a lot of people looking at this kind of thing in my , couple shades are really really bold but why not use those shades that people are gonna be like steering away from into this video so I'm gonna go ahead and put star power into the crease it's a nice hot pink look at that pigment though wow ok the first time using it you guys like this is like we're using this together taking it all the way into the inner corner and now we have this is really hot pink crease I don't know everything looks so cool I just blend it out a little bit with a 27 again this pink is like more than neon bright pink did everyone make sure the edges are clean so that might take the shade vanity on a morphine 18 inches are packing up on the outer corner just give me a little bit of definition it's like a purple color very small amount of it because I don't want it to be a main focus of this look just a little bit of the outer corner it's a nice like deep blemish great almost with a pink I'm gonna blend that out something like this now it's nice dark outer corner amazing finale of the darkness on the outer corners looking like this very nice and just edgy and having some more dimension I'm gonna be taking favorite brush at the moment more p.m. - 10 i talked about this already in my last favorite video such a good packing brush and not the shade china white which could actually be like my favorite shade in this entire pallet it's so so so nice it's like a nice just creamy white color so pigmented and i love this Shane's online and 43 just blend out those edges a little bit I just looks very like barbie glam so I want to do eyeliner I'm gonna do black eyeliner and take the kat von d tattoo trooper liner and i'm going to do a wing just feel that bad boy in great we have the eyeliner on it now and as you can see just adds a really cool extra cat-like definition that makes it much more wearable to like the pink in the crease I know it's kind of scary to some people but it makes it much more when you do a nice eyeliner look like this so i wanted to add a nice bold freaking eyeliner just a fucking cut about that they try you it's not like that so not going to be taking a more 1536 and the shade expensive and that's gonna go on the bottom lash line if it's a blue shade with nice like satin finish like a little small like sparkles of like silver sword on the bottom lash line and really Barbie this bitch oh you know I mean I feel like a little awkward princess I really don't want to get Kourtney just to blend out the blue and I just helped with the appearance of a blend so it looks dark hearts you know I mean I found this island my color pop that looks so cute a periwinkle color in the shape france and i think this is what I do in the water line and I know it's not the same exact color anything but it's just the same color family it's along those lines blue paint periwinkle we're going to do it okay you guys want to do something so bold going to use a freaking cream liner a black liner doesn't really matter taking the same solstice palette and belief about to highlight my like body a more fee and three to six and the same championship don't put that in the inner corner just give me my life back to the high because everything is pretty mad and a little bit on the brow bone as well this is so fucking bright in the room so now we have everything down we're going to curl my lashes and apply some mascara off camera really quickly and this is the final I look I put on a Russian black lashes by knew about some this is the lashes I've been waiting all month right now to my go-to I just like they do such a beautiful like her corner elongated look like out here they keep her down so take a nice smaller last year and they kind of

love these lashes so much me going to be guys in to see what they look like up close so it's one finish off the entire look with the lips now i'm going with a nice affordable lip combination because

video and you guys do like me please like this video and subscribe to my channel if you guys are already and if you're new to my channel what's up so many have to go ahead and start with this video and let's get this bitch going ok great so we're going to start this video i already have my base on like I'm a foundation my contour highlight I just feel like this look is all about that I Sarge wanted to quickly rushed through the face I did not melt lipstick swatches if you want a lot of you guys would like to do a look with the Dark Matter stack or any of the stacks melt because they're really good stacks and they have a great shadows I told you guys about them so for this look I'm going to be using the Dark Matters back from melt sooo i think so then we're going to live in the first we're gonna start off with the shadow blur which is basically like a nice little PG just neutral beige color it's very similar to like peach smoothie and beaches and cream by makeup geek which is like that nice transition if you don't have the shadows totally fine just kind of find the equivalent you guys do have I'm gonna go and take a t27 morphe brush and other newly brushes you guys know the brushes off my finger morphe brushes that they came out with their so good i'm going to add that into my crease my lids already primed and my brows already filled in just a heads or because you got to thinking what the fuck are you doing no I'm ready and ready primed so I'm gonna run that into the crease it's such a pretty transition color i absolutely love it so nice just chill baby i'm going to you guys in a little bit closer exactly like you can't really see but now i'm going to mix unseen and enigmatic these two colors are here nice like neutral brown with a nice really warm cranberry red that come on red tone mixed with like a brown neutral Brown is like my favorite and they're just kind of thinking on your feet and 4 33 you guys know it's my favorite movie brush basically ever and I'm going to put on the outer corner I'm going to run it on the outer corner don't need me to meet with it but you do want to place in like a certain spot because this is going to be like a halo I don't bring it too far in just keep on the outer third of your eye right up into the crease and then do the same thing on the front of the I like the front third part as well start on the lid and bring it up into the crease it should look something like this just by placing the color down and now i'm going to go and make that halo effect I'm not picking up any more product i'm just literally lightly blending from the first third of the third with no additional product i'm just literally using whatever i have left on the brush and blending across to make this nice halo effect in keeping the center of the eye completely bearing then I'm going to grab that same a 27 by Morsi and blend out the edges of the shadows blend so freakishly nicely i was like shocked when first using I was like no no and then go ahead and bring it out slightly over here on the harder third it's nice to have something like this is like a nice warm cranberry brown tone - it's so pretty it's nice and blended want to like this look is so simple that you guys are gonna be like oh my god the fucking thing I'm really having alright so now we have the base of our halo I kind of done we're going to shade dark matter which is the black in this little quad I'm gonna take a very small amount of it because it is extremely pigmented is such a good black name or Fiji 36 which is my favorite pencil browsable damn tom you know that we have a code monkey man you will get you ten percent off I'm just like I'm gonna fill it with more you guys know a lot of you guys know this little you guys don't if you're new to my channel not only is my favorite brush brand of all time but honestly my favorite affiliates to be part of because they're just good people you know more fees such a good brand and they have such good quality and I'm just really proud to be familiar with them you know so we're not gonna take that black I'm gonna take it on the front right before the inner corner I'm just going to feather that forward maybe 36 and the same on the outer corner i'm gonna put it on the corner feather it forward and then take that and for three again and blend out that black into the previous colors just to make the transition a lot more seamless just one more easy just doing circular motions inside that's why i will give you a nice really pretty gradient this is all i need to do for the help are like the halo I part is done the middle of my is completely open and that's what I'm gonna be putting the glitter or whatever we're going to be using much of a planner you want to remember to keep blending through each step you know what I mean you wanted to be a very seamless easy transition so it's kind of a point of this whole thing but I use a two-faced glitter glue to go ahead and put that all over the middle part of the lid the only thing that should be about this glitter glue is that it will take off the product underneath your eye it's kind of sticky so you have to be cautious of that like shadow underneath this it will take off the shadow and then the star of the show which a lot of people have been asking me about this glitter it's the body sparkles silver by England's like one of the most gorgeous glitters I've ever tried to take a 3d glitter from Maxine's similar to that and then I'm going to take a more feet 20 and this is just a really great precision packing brush and that's what you really want to do you want to go to be flying everywhere you know what i mean so that's going to use i'm just going to go into the glitter dust off the excess and start pressing in the center of my not going too far up just where you put the glitter glue out and you want to just put it on the mobile lid you don't want it to be too far up because it's going to transfer your eyes are open so she looks something like this if you notice that the glitter is like not blend it a little bit stark then you can go and go back in with the same blending brush and just kind of go over the glitter slightly without like messing with it - too much i'm gonna say it's hard to blend glitter obviously he's gonna want to be cautious and like blend around it make it look a little more seamless if that's what you want I'm going to finish this thing off camera real quick and I'll be right back perfect now both of the eyes are done this is what it looks like I'm obsessed with this google it this critter is everything so now i'm going to go ahead to the bottom of the eye on this side I'm going to take that nigga unseen one more time on my same you 36 I wiped away the Dark Matter color from it because it was like obviously black want to run that underneath the eye on the outer corner and then on the inner corner as well now I keep a little small baby space in the middle just empty I'm going to take the same glitter glue it was underneath there a little baby well that face though only a mother could love just for shits and giggles you don't want to do this at all i'm taking boom boom room by Mac you guys know this is like one of my favorite - I was that they were released and told us to buy it this is another way to incorporate it i'm gonna put that right underneath to give me that really cool intense sheen on the bottom two that's so fucking bad ass dude might take a little bit baby amount of dark matter the black to add a little bit more dimension yeah it should look something like this for the waterline i'm going to the England kohl pencil number five which is basically a nude liner don't put that in the water line like this look is so grungy so like yeah this is not like a normal everyday look but fuck it I already curled my lashes and apply mascara on so i'm going to take the new bounce on the faction lash this is a collaboration with one of my friends and his name's Alex faction on youtube he is a fellow youtuber and he's like a special effects body painting kind of youtuber and he did a collaboration with new bounce some which has no Bella means from the balance of my favorite lashes of all time like literally ever let's do this faction / actually never worn these are the first time this is the first time I remember you were trying on the slash do this yeah these are cute please give you that nice like outer corner extension these letters are really like natural like this if you are going to more of a natural lashes like great giving you like the next hour corner wing these are great is totally like you need to do and I'll inner wing with this kind of latch it's actually really great that you don't need to I like lashes that are a little more full of more 3d that's just my personal preference but these are really nice lashes for those of you who like that natural lash look you know and this is what it looks like with the lashes on I'm going to you guys in to see what the final looks like up close and personal perfect the eyes are done and we are running so long ok so now i'm going to do some blush because i have my contour and highlight on not like highlight but like I did on door I'm going to take mac blush and warm salt an oldie but goodie on my morphe 3 i'm really hoping the the leads are back in stock the code want us to get some punk so I'm just going to run that on the apples of my cheeks blend into my contour I love this blush warm soul is one of my top blushes of like life it is so good ok and now for the highlight is the first time using this on camera and i love it and I'm dying and live and breathe for it this is the laura geller gilded honey I'm gonna take that on am or PM 501 is one of your brushes to highlight with it really is ok ok hmm since the eye is obviously like the most important part of this look at so dramatic I want to keep the lips really neutral gonna take next people neutral lip liner and why my life oh I'm lined and I'm going to go and take serenity and put that on my lips it's honestly just the perfect like warm brownish pink and put that on my list and I'm going to let that dry and I'm gonna go to a nude lipstick on top just to really like tie it all together honestly you could leave it like this is perfect it's such a neutral color it's not going to interfere with the violence whatsoever but I'm gonna go and make it a little bit lighter because I wanted to be like almost like a blocked out late but not too blocked out i'm going to take YSL number one it's like my favorite one is a lipstick and I'm gonna get that all over the lips it's a very light baby pink and the reason i have started he as my base is going to give me more dimension and keep the lipstick on a lot longer I love the way the Y so looks like smell this but like mango and it should look something like nothing and so this is what the final comes out to be I want to see love this look I think it's so different so unique it's so like weird and kind of grungy but still glam at the same time and I know it's definitely on the dramatic side I think it's a badass though honestly like I don't want to just do natural natural and all the time you know of a natural smoky and why not go full out why not go halo glitter I you know what i mean so i really hope you guys enjoyed this look I got tons of requests to do this looks so i hope you guys enjoyed how he did it yeah other than that what else is the same this is how came out and turn off pretty little yeah if you're interested in anything that

it's finally out I am so beyond excited and i hope you guys are ready for it as well look at these colors man look at these mother lucky cuz we're gonna do the look that I do with this palette all the time so like my go to look for this palette I love it it's absolutely stunning and I think you guys will like it a lot too so yeah I already did my face and in my lips I did my brows I'm just going to doing the eyes on today's video and I'm gonna try to do is make tutorials with this palette has forget possible without getting annoying so this is the first one and i am so excited to show you guys so let's get into it great so first things first we're going to be taking beaches and cream and a mixture of Sora on e 27 brush and that's just going to make our own custom transition shade i love doing this especially with these two colors sore is a very beautiful burnt orange shade and beaches and cream is a very pretty neutral like transition chain putting those into my crease with 7 brush not just going to go all the way and as you can see it's depositing such a nice amount of color I love doing this with any 27 because i feel like the 27 brush my morphe is so fluffy and it deposits a really really nice range of color rather than just putting too much on or too little on you're going to see just how easy this look at you guys are gonna be like yes bitch as you can see it is a nice orangi transition with the crease nothing to him the clothes are extremely pigmented so you don't you put a lot of product on it and it's really a Bob ok taking a more free and for 33 this is really nice do for the mac 217 or Sigma e25 I'm gonna go in with frappe which is a permanent shade by making me twitch a beautiful like maple brown color and I think this shade in the crease is so stunning I'm just going to pack it onto the outer corner just to give such a nice definition and really pretty warm to the look at to go all the way in which is very light hand with that you don't want to go too heavy it's very lightly go all the way in and then take that you 27 one more time just going to blend out of those edges you guys make a geek shadows because I've ever tried to keep shadows you know that the blendabilities Nicki shadows are literally so good it's insane up on the are you have something like this nice we just warm crease and the fuck is next pitch what the heck of it we're gonna go in with Aphrodite which is a beautiful plumage brown shade it's stunning is a very deep color on a morphy e36 pencil brush I just want to keep the color very concentrated where I wanted to be something using a pencil brush you can use any brush you want to use it for me a pencil brush works really great with this kind of look I'm just on the outer corner and drag it up into my crease with the product i have left on the brush and i'm looking at about one third of the way into my high and taking it for three one more time I'm going to blend out that Aphrodite shade into the previous two shades just make the blend a lot more seamless I really wanted to be a very seamless easy blend this look is really definitely my everyday look because I just think it's absolutely perfection not to be a bitch and not to be biased but I think it's perfection you should have something like this now that we're rocking that crease hardcore taking a little bit of fix plus i'm going to spray my morphine for 21 which is not very flat packing brush just a little bit of X plus on it because I feel like for a foil shadow and makes it look like a lot more intense and like oil you know to me it's just gonna do on this brush and then I take the shade at luna which is a beautiful to be pink color it's a very intense shine color i'm gonna go ahead and put that on the lid know i'm doing a mixture of both packing and wiping emotions that's kind of how i like to do the foil shadows by makeup geek and make sure when you're using a foil shadow using the correct primary for your i am really really oily lids you want to use a primer that's good for oily lids like me I use the Smashbox 24 hour one or the map won the 24 hour Mac one whatever it's called is really really good too because they are very hardcore and silicon and they're going to help keep the oil of your legs at bay which is what i need for foil shadow if you have tried using foil child before an increased on you try using a primer that is very good for oily lids I'm just going all the way up to front pay like this and then to get a 40 one more time we're going to blend out those edges very very lightly though I really don't mind it being kind of harsh because I think it kind of looks cool but I'm going to keep the edges a little bit on the softer side my first stop of the iso then I'm going to take the shade arguments with a very pretty golden like a pale gold champagne shade on am3 26 by morphine is a very small detail brush it's great for the problem grief in her corner so I want to do on the highlight of the problem with this shade very very very lightly though because this is a very very intensely reflecting shade as you can see it's like button on the inner corner as well same brush such a pretty according to see a shit do you see that shit o Lord O my lord jesus okay so I'm gonna go and finish the other eye on top of it off of camera and then I'll be right back hey guys i went ahead and i did my mascara eye lashes and liner off camera I went ahead and just do that i really want to just kind of focus on the shadows because that is what this tutorial is because I see me do I wonder so many so many times really want to keep it focused on the shadows ok and i want you guys to like inspiration with the shadows you've been doing with this looks or not you can do lashes with this look or not it doesn't matter imagine the bottom lash line now so I want you guys to that part just in case you guys are carriages so much like i'm going to go ahead and take sora on a 18 pencil brush my morphe this is a really really great pencil brush with a very fluffy pencil brush rather than being so compact like the e36 is so I'm gonna take that on the lower lash line and just really run that underneath and start building up that nice orange you transition color so now we have soared down first so it just looks like a nice just orangie underneath the eye transition shade no I'm going back in with that - 36 just kind of just off whatever color you have left another 30-60 might have a little bit of Aphrodite left for taking fat pay and that's not going to her corner and talk about half way in to the I the beautiful like brownish maple shade is just stunning I free to go about halfway in on the e36 pencil brush just kind of buff out and give me some more color and dimension on the outer corner taking in be 43 I swear expressions like my life saver taking me 43 buy morphine and Aphrodite one more time and that's gonna go tight line on the bottom lash line about one-third in just to keep the darkness on the outer corner just like i did with the top and doing the same thing on the bottom like this and then taking the e36 and blending that out a little bit more just what it looks so harsh and start there and then grabbing any nude liner i'm going to take the tart in a room liner the new chairman put on the inner rim of my I just going to be more of an open a wake look that's the look i like to go for with this shadow combination and then adding a little bit of mascara to the bottom lashes as well ok guys so it's going to me to see what I look like up close and personal and that is if my entire tutorial is about him coming I like chills just thinking about it because it's been so crazy but I'm just I'm so excited that you and i hope you guys enjoy the palate

you guys know that you guys have made this palette possible hey guys so welcome back to my Channel today I'm starting off different am starting off with no makeup on my control with no makeup on thinks we're weird someone hot mess so let's just jump right into it so many people requested for me to do that like green and wright smokey eye so I thought I would feel right now I'm kind of 6 i'd love to hear in my voice but i had the sniffles and so much i hate it as much as i can look around like you know I mean some let's just get right into the beyond hope you guys like it and let's just jump right in yeah first let's go ahead and we're going to do with the whole face today healthy so we're going to go in with the YSL fusion foundation in the color warm ivory this is a gift from one of my friends and must use it in a store window I had like a something facial hair beard this thing going on right now if you're gonna might as well do it more sheer to medium coverage foundation so it doesn't really interfere with the beard area i love this smell this foundation so until the roses and I was put on the back of my head and just smear it on and then we're going to go in with the morphe and 439 haven't used this pressure i keep hearing about great things about it's a huge cube-like buffing brush and so I'm really excited transplant out i'm just gonna present into my face the foundation in oh I get it project start using this one all the time he always tells me that such a great brush for like that your brush finish and foundations I feel like a little bit late for me i know i'm already like ghostly pale but I know these foundations a little bit like but for me I to go in with some people there a little bit lighter than me that we can always bronze up after you know and I try to avoid the under eye area as much as much as I can be somewhere I can go to concealer under that not only one with mac pro longwear concealer and NW 0 minutes and golden heart I like to go pretty hammered concealer and on the islands to prime for our eye shadow and then we're going with the morphe m35 which is basically the mini baby concealer version of them i am obsessed with the stretch i've been using it quite a lot actually and i love this because it really picks up anything I don't mean like all the excess product I don't need on the brush that shit huh week the fuck hey I was running the brush and you are i might need a little more coverage i usually have a little more breakouts my forward a little bit over with a little bit more foundation on that area i do love this foundation I really do don't think I mean I've said before the only thing i don't like about it is that if i have any dry patches it tends to pick up my dry patches a little bit and I don't like that all baby i need you to cover the show that's wrong with you I look like fucking Casper i'm using LA girl Pro powder I've never used this power on myself so I'm here to see how this looks fucking curious about this because I really you know so I grabbed a morphy and 401 which this large natural hair fluffy brush that's extremely soft go right into that Shin just doubled my things okay too bad it's not so bad i'm not gonna lie something that I can each d silicon layer you know let's go ahead and broad real quick because I feel like I look like hot ass men ok we're going to one with the self p cosmetics 1 of 1 which is this like taper paddle fluffy brush and the morphe control palette and we got the machine was going to run in my areas that i like to call the roll okay i'm going to be me because my hair I woke up looking like a real hot masturbating wrote a room so that's why I'm running heat look at their third because you know you know what is your second you're just like I don't care how I look right now I'm just committed to it anyway that's how I feel that's why I was like I'm gonna keep the facial hair I'm going to shave not gonna get like to wear any I'm gonna grab my morphe and 438 I talked about this isn't my favorite video was amazing and mac cohabiting powder and emphasis on let's go underneath there i'm with toes cheekbones bitch my phones for years now going

area nothing too crazy don't just look so chipper for the highlight we're gonna go in with our escort or powder made with mack daddy remain fantasy which is basically that this reflect teal blue highlighter and I figured you to lip i'm doing a green right smoky why not go ahead with the highway it's different I don't give a shit Colonel the limited come to our spring that on the more people used to have in our area with I'm gonna dust it on the highlighted plans you just gave me this really cool very different kind of highlight you know like it literally looks like it's highlighted but it gives you that nice greenish tone to it can blame I think it looks super freaking cool I mean of course you guys don't have to go in with the Greenwich highlight but that's not normal but you know what I was thinking when I woke up this morning the first thought in my head was in life don't know what I'm gonna bloom yes page you had so now that we have that nice intense as they going on within that fluffy pressures really kind of just blend the two together the blush and highlight just kind of really married much better it's very different and I like it I don't give a shit so i would say that my face is pretty much time have we got into a thing um let's go ahead and do one I doubt the actually no we're going to browse I'm gonna go to the browser real quick off camera because I think forever and a time so I'll just go to my grams of camera and i'll be back so we have our brows done I I was really trying to go for more of a natural brow but it and start to turn more and more fleek as we continued so we'll just go with it i'm not going to come off and do it again oh just go right to it so that is i'm gonna try to do you guys say for the eyes more because you guys have been requesting me to do that suburbs really try to sell the shit and I just get nervous because my faith is my perfect ok that will resume into the eye area hope you guys are happy we're going with makeup geek beaches and cream on a sigma e40 that's not right into our crease area senior transition shade as you guys already saw we had already primed with um with a consistent format or you can go in with that teaches in current let's go right into our crease area donated you need to put that bitch in there are trying to quantify I'm i grabbed vanilla bean and make it as well it's this little light and

guys know about coming over to make a geek bitten estetica that's going to increase area just really just go right in start carbon crease and we're gonna go right above our creatures a little bit above it see that they're going with a 40 again and really tough out that bitten color we don't want to be too harsh and this is why it's so crucial to have a transition color down first so much easier it's blending out now that we have that transition ok bring it outwards as well i got my crown cramping well not only that color nice and blended we're gonna go in with the next general pencil in black bean that's a go right on top of our lid so i put a good around the center and i use my finger to rebut out the rest of it right up to the crease with this and the farther you go out the lighter you want to go on the pressure ok so we have that nice black sticky base down we're going to go in with being sugarpill love plus is this really dark deep red color and that one going to grab onto more fiji 15 it's just flat brush and really just press onto the black ok and having a black beast out first is going to really make that below that red color pop so much more keep packing arm right up to didn't ok now that we have that nice red base down go in a more fee and 443 now we're going to really start to bug out the edges of the black liner base with it okay to go right into their really focus on buffing out those corners and edges going to be a little bit tough to bust out but we really need to focus on having no hard lines keep just keep going and keep working with the color keep really focusing that left plus and buffing it outwards now let's go ahead with the e-40 is really buff out the edges even more they'll pack on more color if I notice it's it's missing some going a little bit past that black these so starting with something like that again the key with this look is really taking that time to bust out those edges make it look like it's not too harsh so now we're actually just give it more dimension to the I we're going to go in with the Anasazi a shadow called beauty mark which is like this deep plum purple brown that's sitting on the outer corner just kind of really married that black with that red ring really just press it in with little pencil brush and after you continue to blend blend blend blend blend you should get something like this I was grabbing a clean brush really blending out those edges and wanted to any harsh lines awesome so it's going to bottom now we're gonna grab that same Nicks black jumbo aunt flo letting me run around that underneath the eye you don't need me without going to grab that same 32 and really just buff out that black blend it outwards now we're going with sugar another triple shadow in the color adoring

gold glitter on the inner corner I wanted to make it still like really cute and fun if you guys want to go out for something like more festive and but keep it still very much on the chilly side for those of you who don't really want to venture out as much and go check the full color intensity you know i'm saying so I think this will turn out really really pretty it's a very very pretty for like spring and summer it's very fresh it's very lightweight and i feel like my skin is very glowy and bronze in just looks nice so that's kind of what I was going for with this looks specifically as

subscribe to my channel if you weren't already and if you knew what's up man you anyway and welcome to my channel and yeah it's going to get into this one brand tutorial on urban decay let's get into this one brand tutorial with Urban Decay i'm so excited to be doing this I haven't done one brand in a while that's what i did was totally believe first things first I'm gonna take the Urban Decay v6 setting spray but it's also like a priming spray and spray that all of the face I've heard great things about this is great I thought I had the d slick primer I don't know where the fuck I put it no idea i know i have it somewhere but I just lost track of all my shit I have no idea where I put it so as for now we're going to use this key success rate cool for foundation I'm gonna be going in with the naked skin a wait list in the shade 3.5 i'm actually not the biggest biggest fan of this foundation on my skin type tons of people are obsessed with this foundation and I know why it's absolutely beautiful on the skin however because I have more on the early side it doesn't seem to really like working in my favor I don't want no I'm taking on more feet and 4 39 and start buffing that into the skin give me a nice even coverage this is a really beautiful foundation i think it looks so so pretty however my school it is such a lightweight like watery consistency is a nice just like medium coverage and this is definitely a foundation for more people that are a combination normal or dry i think perfect the base is on and i think it looks pretty looks pretty good I think the base is very beautiful so now that is i'm going to be mixing a V weightless concealer with the cleric correcting fluid in the pink one someone take first the actual concealer party that's gonna go right underneath my eye like right about yeah do that oh my god so this is what it's like to have more of a new one okay although i have this fucking dingy living here here here knows a little bit highlighted to fail and seeing the color corrector the pink why I'm still here right underneath here a little bit not too much really just what kind of bringing the whole thing in terms of looks fucking white which how things are going to get there and I'm gonna take a damp Beauty Blender and start to blend all that out then blend into the foundation I am so beyond obsessed with this concealer you guys this is one of the best can see there's I've ever tried ever and that's like saying a lot because I've tried a lot of concealers this could actually be the best I've ever tried this one and like the mac pro longwear and the it bye-bye under i believe it's called bandra awesome so now we have all the highlight blended together i'm going to set it really quickly I'm i said it with this medium light powder biomedical obviously this is like a face powder but he's underneath my eyes to set what's going on because it's all that on the morphe 48 I'm the type of person that if I don't set my concealer increases increases like gnarly like not normal creasing like I'm talking craters I'm talking creators so just going to set it basically everyone i put the concealer i'm going to set with this powder as well and then for the rest of the face I'm gonna be taking it is HD powder Byron ok this is there naked medium light on a big power brushes of the 41 by Murphy and I'm going to run all over the rest of the face I didn't put that lighter complexion powder just so i can set everything in place I definitely need to set this face because it will move so much this foundation powder HD powder by urban it's so nice it's the most silkiest like lightweight beautiful powder like every project I told me about a while back and then after he talked about is when i started using it and I honestly haven't stopped by bring it to like all my events with me like I where all the time it's all good it's such a lightweight beautiful HD powder like it says what it is and you like such a smooth like application and appearance look at my face come on smooth ok now we're going to bronze up the skin I'm gonna take the Urban Decay beach the bronzer in the shape bronze this is like they're darker bronzer this color basically I was trying to get a life and dimension back to the face on the morphe - great just kind of powder brush to bronze up the skin I like to interchange between this one and the five to seven and i believe it's called I don't have a contour color by urban so we're going to do is going to make it work with this i know i'm doing a one regulatory with urban decay I definitely want to get towards like summer ending bronzy and like just and pretty you know what it means that's kind of what I'm going forward with the skin and this bronzer is so beautiful I'm looking like I'm having some color come on miami son give it to me to give myself more of a cleaner appearance but just like its kind of muddy on the bottom here I to have like more of a clean contour line I'm gonna take that same be 48 and that same powder that we used earlier and you have to kind of clean underneath the bronzer to get more of a sharp appearance just like this to the already just makes us different like it looks sharper and more defined it's not like it's dramatic when i click on there anything i just made some nice just subtle little difference like nothing too crazy another bronze to fail I'm gonna be taking the fetish blush on the morphe three this is like a really pretty mabi blush start brushing it onto the skin it's like a pretty much of color can see that it's free and it's highly the skin i'm gonna go ahead and take a two-hour powder blush in the shade sin you guys this highlighter is one of those pumpkin one's ever really good things about it actually haven't tried to get my first time trying on more feet I'm not more p310 let us see how this works oh she hey is me in my light it's only popping highlight for sure oh my god bless afraid of this highlight right now I think the blushes like home not me you know and let's go to move on to the eye area okay great so for the brows what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be taking it be a brow beater micro-fine brow pencil ok in the shade dark I'm just gonna run up to browse all right to do my brows honestly like to start from the bottom of the brow feather backwards I like to keep most of the product on the bottom part of my brow rather than the top like to have more of a clean line down here like this we have a nice just really defined brow line now and then we're going to fill it in naturally just very very very lightly nothing too heavy and now want to have the desired thickness of the brow i'm going to be taking route camera which is a little basically tinted brow gel and run that through the brow it's a tamer it's about Taylor came the brows digging this broad timber those no the brows I privatized already i just took the urban a concealer the negative way this one on my eyes I should use the freaking the actual eye primer Medicaid it's so good primer potion can I may be thinking a lot of the single shadows by urban decay which are absolutely amazing they have a beautiful shadows the single shadows and i really do think they're very very pigmented very nice I'm i combined riff and ABC gum which is like this vanilla shade and a sec orangi muted shade and that's gonna be like are basically our transition crease color and sit on the morphe 27 code many of you wait for ten percent off Lou shameless plug and morphe brushes . com and in store I love that brand I love that brand so much I'm taking actually a little more of the riff shade which is that like burnt orange a muted color oh my i did kind of bronzy because my face I feel like is more on the bronzy glow sign all the same thing for the highest i want like the whole look to be very very cohesive now have this is really just muted orange shade down now but this single shadow in the back which is like more of a dark cool toned brown and actually go on the most outer corner just to give me some more definition and dimension on a morphine and 433 a very pretty cool tone brown eyed people use for the brows I can see someone using this on the browse for sure let it out with the same he 27 with no additional part just to make sure it's a nice blend so now i'm going to do is I'm going to take the shade x which is I really cool golden peach duochrome shade absolutely stunning are you joking me this is like everything and then I mix it with the shadow called cosmic which is like a very glittery white shade I just like mixing these two combined will give me a really cool intense like glowy look and I'm just gonna go for it take it on my finger first time taking X on making your first and just going to fucking town man oh hm in chile and welcome girl and once I have the shadow x down which looks absolutely stunning you look even at this you can buy this one hundred percent by it mhm you know extra and I think the shade cause make it was gonna have the right on top of it to give me more of a glittery shimmering effect which I just want to go for today oh ok hi dimension how are ya oh I love this look I feel like it's so pretty and just so like I don't like up like I'm going to fucking prank that's a lot of print fat it's just so pretty and dainty and today i fucking love me going back in with that wrist shadow I'm gonna take it on a 36 and run underneath my lower lash line to start to really mesh together the top and the bottom of the lash line I just want to make sure everything is very cohesive taking it about like two thirds of the way in because the eye is very very more on the neutral site i want to take a little bit of a pop of color and I grabbed the 24-7 glide on pencil in the shade abyss which is a good a glittery blue shade i believe I'm gonna run that in the water lining my eyes are watering to take a bitch give me a little pop of something a little pop color so I have a couple of glitter options i don't know if i want to do pink I want to do gold the gold is what I use on my cousin so late when i did that inner corner thing i'm going to do the exact same thing just adding a little bit inner corner pop but I feel like the people go better with the blue in a minor so I do pink haha ok I'm gonna bring the K heavy metal glitter in junk shell that sounds disgusting but I live for it now we're going to apply that on the inner third of the way I something very subtle very other guns are I'm gonna add a little bit of the gold on top of it why choose one when I have them both i don't i don't know what i would do that add a small amount of the gold a little bit further in okay great so you have something like this just a nice little pop of glitter on the inner corners just to be cute and fast and we're going to apply some mascara and they're owned by some lashes and call it and I and then taking the perversion bigger blacker batter lat mascara I'm going to put my lashes with that you know the cool thing about this mascara is it's a very very very lightweight formula that doesn't feel heavy at all i'm making

figured i was saying time you guys are interested in seeing my full face like routine i link my last property tutorial down below if you guys are interested in that shit so you can see like what i did my face go so now first things first we're going to prime my eyelids are going to use the mac prolongwear concealer as our primary uses printer quite often I just like it because it cancels out any darkness and render some I had when I said it was some powder it just it doesn't crease on me alas all day i really like it and I'm gonna go ahead and set it with a very light just translucent powder I just wanted to be able to be blended into a little bit easier so i'm just using the translucent powder music Laura Mercier translucent I'm actually pretty excited to do today's video because I have a plan to do a cool tone is like my plan I have a plan to do a cool tone so I'm like yes I can do this and I do warm tones all the time try to be brave into cool tones so this is my color palette scheme for today that it's very cool too i think it's really pretty I think that work out pretty well so which means some luck mama needs it so first things first we're going to start with the sigma e40 and going with peaches and cream and that's going to increase this is my makeup geek it's my favorite transition shade of all time it's just a great shape because it's very neutral it's not too warm soft cool because we advise transitions got my shadows can blend into them way easier than if I could without it that makes sense making shadows are my favorites house like all time basically like I said we're together so what's so good and they're only six but like I just basically me like they slay me hard i'm gonna go ahead and take a more feet and 43 and I'm gonna take a little bit of barcelona beach that's going to go into increases well i'm going to kind of mix it in with that beaches and cream I want to be a little more cool tone and this partial on beach is a very cool tone neutral brown i'm gonna go ahead and put that to the crease and blend that into the cranial Angela Sun so now i'm actually gonna go in with dusty rose by Anasazi beverly hills and that is also going to increase with morphine for 3 and this is going to really help bring that cool tone in a single right into the crease with it take it all the way into the front of the crease go back in with missing money 0 and blend that how we don't want our transitions you know letting out wasnt it 40 is just it's so crucial to me and I do this all the time because know you're watching channel you guys feel what I'm feeling you feel in it let me being cool toned feel proud though before I forget I'm gonna go ahead and grab on to use on associate black eyeshadow on a sophie 315 that i'm just going to toss onto my highlighted area so i'm actually not this is be brave we're gonna go in with the Duchess shadow by makeup geek very tiny baby amount of it fell off and i wanted to add a little more purple to it i think it's going to be pretty with a little buffer bonus to it that the corner and then taking it up very slightly into the crease and blending that out with an e 0 it's gonna help bring this nice cool tone purpleness to the look and I think it looks so sick dr. of a little further in because they look sickening very light almost non-existent pressure it feels like you're not touching yourself you're doing a right to blend with that you 40 again she looks something like this nice little cool tone purpley grayish crease yeah i'm gonna go ahead and grab moondust shadow by naked geek and it's like a nice pretty chill bead took color what area are waiting on a more features team now we're going to press on to the lid is going to be our base shadow it's a very cool tone topi color now go in without and 43 and with no additional product actually kind of blend out the edges and then for like the sitting part i'm gonna take on another bogey hills shadow metal on my finger so that I'm not gonna run on my lid and it's looking out for intensity is that she is sickening I'm gonna take that on the lid and press that on over moondust just like shimmery intensiveness fuck man i was more one more one more I'm gonna take fix+ on that same g15 spray the bitch with things get it wet this nice intense metallic look I mean fucking cool tone for the first time like ever let me go crane was gonna take a little bit of metal in my inner corner as well give me that intense highlight we're gonna grab the am or PM 507 which like a little tiny baby tapir brushes don't kill and I go in with correct shadow by making a geek and I'm gonna run on the outer corner very lightly and nothing too intensely a little V I don't want to be too intense because i want to keep that purple like very prominent but i do want a little bit darker thank goodness for this little pointed brush but this shit is precise as hell and i'll go back in with it and for 33 and just kind of blend out that even more to have something like this the top of the lid I know me because I'm not a little pencil brush and I'm gonna grab makeup geek my beaches and cream and mix it in with dusty rose by Anasazi beverly hills and around underneath my lashline I'm really trying to get that nice greatest dusty rose color go in and then on a more precise morphine and 508 which is a very tiny little bit of talked about this before it's great getting underneath the lash line i'm gonna take that same depth shadow i'm a geek and that was gonna run underneath my lashline very close to my last thing I wanted to be just a very subtle hint of purple putting the help i'm gonna go ahead and do something later I'm gonna grab the Kat Von D tattoo liner right now it's my favorite lining like I'm obsessed ok this is how obsessed with I'm obsessed with in the way of doing my wing then I fill it in with another liner I don't make sense like I do love this because it gives me the most precise wing and I think it's beautiful but when it dries it's like it dries shiny fish and I don't like that like more like a mad dry down so I do like my outline of the link with this and then i'll fill in with a different liner ya go to our wings boom television affiliate i'm gonna go ahead and take my makeup forever ink liner that dries matte little tea did I just-okay travesty was slightly bored so I think it looks okay aborted that's right we're told me go ahead and finish the bottom of the I somebody use the same 50 a brush with correct a little bit of corrupt and that's going to meet the bottom lash line for only the outer third though that's just them for some bonus definition so now that we have our I done we have 1i done I'm gonna go and finish other I off-camera and i will be right back so I have shadows on for both of the eyes i'm just going to line my waterline with the next pitch black tree jolie liner the bitch is so dark and like so good like I'm shocked I see let's do the other side so i think

have the face completely done like I just wanted to have the face out of the way you know the facings forever and I've been doing a lot of full face stuff recently so much you know what it's okay let's get back to the face today and the right so only using a couple shades because this is gonna be more of a natural look I only have four so it's going to start with this bad boy great huh I live with this weird thing ok so first thing we're going to go in with peach smoothie by making week I know it's different for me about using beaches and cream this is gonna be a little more on the natural side i really don't need to do like a transition or anything like that finding morphy 27 brush right now this is like basically my favorite like fluffy blending brush this reminds me look at me 40 x sigma but a little bit softer so that's why I like it so much that's just gonna go to the crease because this look is so gonna be on the natural side I'm not being me with this whatsoever i'm putting into the crease and then just kind of do what I want with it and I'm gonna take another one my favorites favorites from makeup geek it's called frappe it's this gorgeous neutral brown like I who I left my pay I can I love trapping and I don't really use on my channel lot but using more in real life but something is out on the outer corner and then running out to the little bit and concentrating on the outer corner and just keeping it out there as well as by the lash line and this is just to give it some more added dimension to look I'm not really doing anything I'm not doing too much anything crazy just getting a little more dimension so when you look at the I it gives you more of a WOW factor rather than just being a flat surface you know what i mean and for me special especially because I have kind of like hooded lids going on so I'm like let me just go ahead and not accentuate that thanks thanks love you so much basically the whole thing is like neutral and brown or something like that I'm gonna go in with I'm speechless by making because well it is just one of their new duochrome shades basically what it is like a gold that reflects peach I thought it would be such an easy fun way to incorporate a little bit of color on the lid but not too much because i want to keep more of the natural science going to place a little bit almost like on the inner corner at the inner third of my eye using my finger to just kind of blend that peach lip shade out oh it's so cute machine put on the whole lid because i think it's actually really really pretty I haven't used to get something like shocked I who tell me that's not cute as fuck and 43 again just kind of putting out those edges a little bit of blend in again we're not being too neat so now we're going with am or PM 508 which is a small little smudge brush is very flat like that and then I'm gonna take corrupt make it because well it's just going to be a little bit of black shadow I'm taking a very small baby amount of it i'm just going closest to the lash line with that because I'm not gonna do I know what this whatever they want to keep it more than natural side but I want to keep a nice amount of definition of my lashes so i'm gonna do is i'm going to run that corrupt shadow along my lash line and even like bring it up a little bit over here make it look like a shadow just not very very very subtle smoked out like lash line at the top so now i'm going to take a little bit of the trade show lead liner by next time I put that on my waterline it's the brown one I actually really like this brown liner because it's like a gel liner go . a little coat of mascara I'm gonna take my roller lash by benefit my favorite mascara and I put a little code of that on my lashes while the curl just do a quick little coverage the cute little coat a little mascara focus on me lean on me playing in a strong but i'll be afraid so so now that we have the eyes done already have mascara on top and the bottom i use the glass for the bottom as always you guys already know I don't want to show you guys because they're just feel like you know I'm gonna take the new balance and flashes in the style serengeti which is a different style for me i'm not using Bellamy know you guys proud this is like more of a flare like a wispy pair they have a couple of shooting out past like the original length I don't know how to explain them feels like they have a lot of layers just why don't you just don't stick okay let's find some sticks at school no like this there's this really cool intense like spidery effect that spidery but they actually look really really cool I think they look super super super badass what you think also about some I'm an affiliate you can save twenty percent off with a good man anyway that's a really cool affiliate program i think they're the they're one of my favorite failure to be part of because they actually take care of the customers on like a lot of the other last brands I've like worked with him like yo hook it up for my piece and they really do and I really appreciate that about them obviously the eyes r feeney that means they are done in a different language I'm like so everyone out towards chicken - yeah i am living for these lashes though like actually living breathing dying for them and see if they're even there I see what i'm going to do explain it perfect so we have our face completely done I'm going to the lips now i really want to go with a more fall intense lip because you guys had requested that so now I'm going to do I'm going to go in with first colour-pop lippie pencil in the shade poison thing is one of the newest collection is actually i'm not quite quite sure i think i'm a ruin our burning shade it's a very warm honestly like I don't mean I can't even get over the fact that the clip art pencils are so smooth and so good and they're only like five bucks you're not your mouth of the baboon's ass hole looking good so now that we have our lips lip line i'm gonna go ahead and with Heather's by Anasazi Beverly Hills is one of my favorite liquid lipsticks that they've ever done I think it's absolutely stunning and I think it's just good on literally every skin tone as long as you're confident wearing the shade you can pull it off I promise you like anyone can pull this color off its stunning oh sure and that's what it looks like while it's drying let it dry real quick and yeah that's it that's it for the entire look I hope you guys enjoyed this video let me know what you guys thought in the comments box below i love you

color forgot how much i love this black honestly I was so that while hunting like it almost put a restraining order on me it was so bad like our mom says I'm going to take the artist at glo kit in gleam which is like the more pinky version and we take that on a and x 10 what news I don't I don't know we're going to take a little bit of mimosa and crushed pearls and we have that on the cheekbones just give us a nice pretty picky glow I honestly don't even know why i will make us both when I overdraw like a mother bugger but why do i do that i don't know i don't know taking the laura mercier translucent again on a little powder brush I'm just gonna go ahead and do a little bit of cooking underneath that quantum ah wait a couple of thinking and then just gonna brush it away ok cool so now that is time for the eyes I wanted to a very pretty like subtle when designing shit shit what I want to do i don't know i'm gonna go with it i'm just gonna grab the palette I want to use I'm gonna go with it I'm gonna be taking the naked 3 by remote cabin use cotton so freaking long actually this one's a brand new one that I'm in case I mean if they like custom made it will expand on it I think it's super super cool that they do that thank you guys are gonna k feel like it's so easy to create a very romantic and soft look using this palette so that's why we're going to go into a more feet we have been that i know and i'm going to be taking the shade limit which is a very pretty just neutral like dusty pink essentially and that is gonna go into the crease and decide then this shade is a very beautiful just pinky base color and I feel like that look so nice with the range of soft romantic look oh look at it already it's so pretty not just go all the way into the crease all the way in using window wiper motions just very softly just blending that out and then i'm going to be taking a more fiemme for 33 which looks like this is like the 217 from Mac do poor like a sigma e25 whatever you want to call it im gonna be taking the shade nooner with this color is a very dusty pink little bit deeper than living color was gonna be taking that into the currents of the well this was going to be going a little bit lower right now we're just deepening the crease a little bit more nothing to him I just want to give it more dimension I'm really just keeping it on the outer corner i'm not going in far as in that we keep on the outer corner and then just take the e 27 again and just blend out that a little bit isn't this looks so soft and so pretty like I just looks so beautiful like I just wanna like be romanticize right now I want to take a bitch on a date I want hey sometimes they often it is not something i say often I just want to be like the Daniel shipping up i'm gonna go ahead and take a m3 26 and the shade of strange essentially it's a white color it's a very just creamy beige color and I'm gonna put that on the brow bone to highlight the brow bone a little bit with not just a match shade and then taking a packing brush I'm gonna be taking the shape burn out which is the third shade from the pallets and go right here so very just like sadnie peach shade the peachy pink sheet I don't know what that on the lid they look on the eyes I feel like I want to really look pretty and natural and it's going to take that and just lightly run that over the lid I don't look so pretty and so like romantic it's very soft and like DNT you know I want to do a wing but I want to do like a shadow I'm going to take off your hat - yeah okay , taking more feat e-40 3 which is a very just flat defining brush it is a great brush for anything of the kind of detail work and I take the shape black heart which is the last shade in the palette is the darkest one is a good black with like reddish reflect in it essentially i'm gonna be putting that on the lash line to make it nice and like defined without being too harsh which is whatever you want to do it's like we're tight lining with a shadow instead of eyeliner so we kind of intimidated by doing eyeliner is a really easy way to incorporate darker eyeshadow without being too hardcore you know and I'm gonna take that whatever i have left on the brush and just going to run that out here yeah take a more 5036 just kind of let out the outer corner a little bit with no additional product just because I want to keep it really soft let's still defined at the same time ok so in this is that what you have so far tonight it's just easy shadow extension I'm gonna take a little bit of concealer and just kind of clean that up a little bit you don't have to do this that if you want to keep it just kind of smoky and like soft do it dude like do your thing but i personally make it a little bit more clean on the edges just because I like that kind of luck and then just go ahead and do the other eye anyway so that's how the guys are basically done like I am good i don't need to do anything else with them I think they look just fine and I call my eyelashes and mascara off camera as well so what I'm thinking is I wanted to do lashes I'm you can keep this look at just how it is you don't need your lashes whatsoever you want to keep it soft and romantic like you don't need to that but I do need to do that because i'm a lash girl I'm gonna be taking the house of lashes iconic lashes i think this would be a really pretty lashes with this look because i do have that really nice like shadowy winged effect going on so I think it lasts like this which is really nice and extended on the outer corner will be really pretty pilots bad both I wish I was the one online as perfect as it looks but it doesn't honestly like I don't know if I like the way iconic look on me I feel like on everyone else look freaking bomb but on me i don't i don't know what you think give me your honest opinion I just really think my eyes look a little wonky but i don't i don't know i don't know so let's go into the bottom lashline really quickly I'm going to do something very subtle miss Amy 43 brush and I'm gonna take em nooner and limit mixed that's gonna go on the lower lash line just give me some how-to definition on the outer corner I don't want to keep it just so completely bare down here I still want a little some some more te 18 it's going to blend out that a little bit i'm going to take the mac NW + 20 what's this when are you a mac studio , graphic pencil in the nude shade and see 15 nw20 and jumped on the lower lash line just kind of awake in my eyes a little bit more mac mascara on the bottom lash line my favorite mascara forgot to mention I put a little bit of that strange color on the inner corner of my mind with that same morphy detail brush nickel to the eyes are done now I'm going to you guys into that I look like up close and yeah yeah cool so we know what the is going to move onto the lips and then we'll be done with the tutorial i just got this recently had a general kind of K kind of cake with the kylie jenner's candy cane lipstick actually any just bring this up real quick I just wanted to do a quick little shadow - Sarah for sending this to me you knew that I really wanted the Kylie lip kits back to get ahold of him I couldn't find myself and you have an extra one of these so much want to say thank you so much for sending me this like you didn't have to do that like has my father like you really did not need to do that whatsoever I'm so appreciative and grateful that you did so Sarah you're watching this thank you so much for sending me candy cake I really didn't want to hit somebody is it tape it on review but because i'm going to more of a soft romantic look on the face I'm gonna go with a more soft romantic lip and I felt like the kandake lip by kylie jenner would be a really really good suiting lip for this loop I'm going to get the lip liner first feels heavy duty i don't even use that feels very nice heavy-duty very very limited like super nice glides on really easily all the lip liner is fucking guys ok cool we are lip line and now i'm going to apply the liquid lipstick Supreme never never turns yeah okay smells like it's mostly good I don't know it was like vanilla he but it's not like the vanilla I'm used to I don't know it's all good though all this was so nice and I love the formula oh my god I'm so happy what do you guys think of it I think it's so beautiful i love it go to collect a gorgeous color to get deep in nude that was any kind of similar so ready when I was like was seeing it online but it's totally not

and down to earth and just so cool you know what I mean like she's so unapologetically herself I'm so proud of her for doing this collaboration with targets so cool like she's gonna be inside so for us you know what I mean like that is absolutely amazing the power package that came with what they can with a little alligator and little alligator wrapping paper it was just the cutest thing ever so so cool this is the look that came up with with how i have it on my eyes right now i asked you guys on snapchat and on twitter which you actually follow me on you guys are already many anyway on snapchat many ways 73 on twitter check out those i leave them somewhere on this video i asked you guys what you guys want to see a more natural look with this palette or more bold and dramatic look at this palette so end up winning was the bold look and that's why I have such a bowl but on my eyes right now I've been doing tons of bold looks recently but you guys seem to like them and you guys have been voting for bold so that's what I came up with today say how much i rambling on I'm going into this video now as always if you guys like this video if you guys don't like me please don't keep watching you know the drill with that but you guys enjoyed this video and you guys do like me please like this video and subscribe to my channel if you weren't already and if you know what's up man you on your way and welcome to my channel yeah that's going to get into this full face great girl bunny look ok so it's gonna get started on today's video bare-faced nothing on my face right now I wanted to do a cool thing to do today because tons of you guys like what I do full face videos so you know what I'm listening I'm listening to you guys i love you guys and I'm listening ok so first things first we're going to prime we're going to use the makeup every step 1 equaliser in the smoothing at the moment this is literally like my favorite port filling smoothing primer out there i would say that this one and benefit Porefessional are like my favorites so for foundation for today's choice we're going to be going in with the coach and OH aqua foundation i just love this foundation it's so freaking a pretty gonna take two pumps maybe two and a half maybe three let's be greatly I'm in the shade 123 and gives you a very nice lightweight coverage but it's very buildable so I really do love this and so I like to put this around the face and then of course I'll conceal on the areas that need a little more help icon to make my eyes and whatnot so we're going to take this on a Beauty Blender and just put this into the skin okay so I need a little more help on the forehead because i am breaking out a little bit on the forehead right now i just have been on to take the Loreal infallible in the 103 and just put a little bit of that on the forehead and maybe a little on the nose as well because this foundation is definitely one of the luminous dewy side and i want to add a little bit more coverage with the lorry oh and a little more magnifying effect in the t-zone so let's go ahead and can feel I'm gonna take the Makeup Forever HD concealer and y 2 3 i'm not using concealer and a fucking minute so I'm excited is however not really no I use this again squeeze ok yes squeeze honey squeeze away actually squeezing is kind of nothing use my finger inside a little bit on the back of the head and he's not here oh yeah are you going you're way more than I feel like it more guests look at that squeeze finger on the sides of my nose a little this country goes such a long way I love it go ahead and start blending it away how have you guys been I feel like I'm not filmed in a little bit of a minute no I'm just kidding films like fucking yesterday and the day before that what the fuck my things i like this consumer because it is very hydrating it's not like a trying to do whatsoever and so therefore increases less than a drying consider what so I really do like that effect of this concealer not going to set your under eyes with the laura mercier translucent setting powder or whatever how do you guys like that works for you I personally just like this Laura Mercier translucent powder because it works so nicely from my skin type it really sets everything in place it's lightweight but it's still heavy it sounds weird but it really is like a lightweight heavy powder it really works at keeping the coils are baked keeping you from creasing everything you could possibly want from a powder this really does ensure that and i'm using this on an 848 buy morphine you guys I need to tell you guys a secret not even see gracious I just want what's happening so morphy is discontinuing their elite collection brushes I know I know I'm devastated tons of people were telling me on twitter they were like okay so the brushes you've been using on your YouTube like you're linking looks like i do link on my brushes that you is on my description bar like I'm always pretty good with linking everything they're like hey the brushes that you're using are not available more for any more like what you mean so I go on Murphy site and they're not there so I'm like play so then I text the owner Murphy and I'm like you know so I'm just curious like the Lee brushes and what's going on with them what's happening so when he first came out with the lead brushes they were supposed to be limited edition and because they are so freaking popular they end up becoming kind of permanent or like staying on a lot longer than they originally going to so that's kind of like the backstory of the brushes what's going on is that they're actually coming out with a different set of brushes very similar to the elites and they're taking away the elite so if you guys are wondering like why the brushes i have been using have not been on site has not been on the website is because all the brushes that are Jerry now are the last ones of the lead brushes if you like any of the brushes that are there get em while you can because they are on sale and they'll be gone soon so for now just bear with me with the brushes i'm using because the these the ones i have so until they send me the next batch of the new brushes are using i will be using those two I have them just how one man just like the kind of even the title of today's video is using the swamp Queen palette by baby girl and tart she's doing everything club with her she didn't have a tarp like that's so amazing being so congratulations Bonnie I i I'm so proud of you in you should be so proud of yourself you know what I mean this call is absolutely beautiful I'm so so happy for you so I'm just gonna brought up the skin with sweet tea which is the bronzer in this palette on a more fee and five to seven which is still permanent on their site is like the mack do brush for the bronzer which turned into that a little bit oh its payment as fuck got it oh just a little bit off and then start wavin bronzing house color so this color is like a really warm terracotta brown with some gold shimmer to it it's very very very subtle it's not too intense but it just gives you a nice pretty bronzy color oh it is a beautiful beautiful color it's a little bit more on the like warm orange side of a bronzer but we are in summer so that's totally fine with me and I'm really into like warm orange browsers anyway it's actually funny because I get clock all the time on social media my bronzer being too warm for my skin brown like if I like it I like it bro feel like a fucking watch it it is this so-called like all these youtubers coming out with collaborations that I'm so excited for everyone it's just such a cool thing that I'm just so proud of all these youtubers clapping with different brands and not only just small Instagram brands but I huge brands like tar and like Nikki tutorial is going on with to face coming up and Jacqueline of course with becca is just so amazing to see these brands interesting to youtubers enough to want to collaborate with them and yes nikki jackson and Bonnie are all fucking huge youtubers and they're all the killing of the Queens of the game but still like the brand interested them enough they're not celebrities are not in movies you know I mean to endorse a product it's just so cool to see youtubers get this kind of like reaction and get these kind of opportunities even though they're just on youtube you know what i mean so it's just so cool to see that and I'm just very proud of everyone that's done club so far and too how they keep coming and I hope they're just as amazing as the ones that have been coming out i'm going to highlight the under-eye really quickly with my Marc Jacobs instant mark of course be 48 same brush I'm just going to highlight the under part of my eye and I'm also gonna take a little bit of that powder and run it underneath my bronzer to make it more of a clean sharper appearance it doesn't look so money in harsh you feel me and I was like a little bit of mac shade stir just contour a little bit underneath the bronzer on a new brush my morphe this is the g40 it looks really like a awesome contouring brush and I tried it once and I loved it so I'm gonna keep trying it see what I think about it and so is gonna dip into it barely not too much it's small and define but it like I feel like it was really like contour bitch out you know so let's go into our country a little bit yeah see I knew like I fucking knew this was going to be a bomb ass contour brush like I just knew it was gonna take a big fluffy brush and run over it the whole thing just make sure there's no harsh lines and edges to make everything a little soft and date here again of course I'm taking the blood shots in this palette this is the blush called does this thing really work and I think that's from her series on youtube like does this really work so i can take that money more 53 brush or any kind of blush brush that you want to use use that brush and I'm just going to lightly dust oh my god is painted was going to very lightly press and dust off it's like a pinky blush with some golden flecks in it goes into a light layer of this please tell me a little bit of a very pretty soft pink layer ok course we have the blush on now and let's go ahead and highlight because there's a highlighter this bag - it's called Gator wings that is the most perfect name for bunny I've ever heard it's so adorable get your wings so we're going to highlight with that color and i love the blush i think it's very very very pretty and it will be universally beautiful and so many different skin tones so I think they did an amazing job with that so it's one highlight a little bit i'm gonna take a more feet and 5 10 and I think honestly the whole type out this is one of the most excited for is the high later because it is absolutely stunning so freaking pigmented you need to be careful with this whore because it is intense put in the best way and i can just see like it just come on come on dude look at this highlighter like what the freak basically the champagne gold chain it's a very very very lightweight and it almost looks good but it can be white on some tones but it's a very just beautiful champagne gold has gold undertones in its own University studying on so many different skin tones so I think again such a beautiful highlighter it's a very intense like I love it was funny to like with highlighter I get a lot of hate on the amount of highlight I put on and like a lot of like people a lot of people say that like it doesn't look good on me and it emphasizes my texture and what not and it's like yo if I have texture which I do I'm a fucking do have big pores like whatever I have texture why why I avoid something if you have texture like who cares who cares like I used to be so insecure about my texture on my skin and I would want to avoid highlighter because I was so scared of what people would say because I do have like texture of my skin but now I'm like I live you do not give us a single solitary titty about what people say about my texture because i have texture and living with it who gives a shit if you want to wear a fucking pound of highlight on your face just do it doesn't matter what anyone is saying about your face your texture of your skin do it is what makes you happy if it makes you happy to it I went to worry about the highlighter and yes i have texture of my skin yes i have bumps on my face but I'm just like so please do you guys like it please we're headed uh-huh so ya don't the face I'm gonna go and finish off with the eyes now okay cool so we are back now my brows are done and my eyes are primed that's going it started with the eyes now i'm so excited to be doing this tutorial actually asked you guys on Twitter and snapchat we just wanted to see if you guys want to see more of a bold I dramatic look or a natural i love with the more bold lip I think it's literally like fifty two percent was bold I look and the rest was natural look I'm gonna just follow you guys are asking of me and I'm going to a bold dramatic i look with this power today so first things first we're gonna go in with natural peaches on a more feet 27 rush just any kind of fluffy blending brush will work and i'm going to take this shade into the crease this is a very pretty and natural transition like peachy shade is Larry called natural peaches so that's what it is it's a natural peach transition so we're taking morphine and 43 which is very similar to the back to 17 to do for it absolutely love this but I literally have like seven of them they're so good you can always use a code me anyway and all caps to save on more fee I'm an orphan affiliate you guys probably know this by now you guys know me you guys know that they're just my favorite I i absolutely love more feat so I'm gonna take this brush and I'm gonna take a man cat on it which is a purple deep plum shade and that's going to go into my crease extremely extremely pigmented holy and that's just going to go into a crease all the way to the inner corner because this look is going to be more dramatic I'm not to get Marky 23 and blend out the top portion just make sure there's no harsh lines or edges I really just don't like harsh lines when blending I've been doing any I looks even if I'm supposed to have a harsh line I don't like it I'm actually taking it from the bottom of my lower lash line out because I'm gonna make this whole entire look pretty smoky so you should have something like this so far so now i'm going to go in with a I base I'm already primed about going with a different base i'm going to take the pure I polish base top coat in the shade caviar it's a very very like dark greenish gold shade and it's perfectly i want to go on my lid i want to take the shape sippy sippy which is a very deep mob brown but has tons of gold glitter in it so I think they'd be just perfect combined with these i'm going to take this pure I polish with this little pure applicator and put that on the lid close to the lash line and blend it out as well I was grabbing a fluffy brush and blending out the edges of the high polish taking more of that man cat shade i'm going to blend out the edges a little bit just to make sure everything is nice and blended and then we'll be going over that I base with sippy and I'm gonna take a little packing rush i'm just going to take the one that are already provided in this palette is just it's already here and we'll take the shape of a sippy sippy which is a very dark brown plum with basically like gold greenish or reflect clear in it and you have to be careful because this this shadow is pretty powdery only because it is a lot of glitter in it so it will pick up a lot so just be sure to really wipe off the brush when you're doing it dusted off with your finger and then pat on into patting motions right over the eyeshadow base that we used ok guys you have this is so far it's a very very very very intense smoky outer corner I what I did off camera acts like was trying to figure out how to like blend out the crease without getting too like blurred and blended together what I grabbed was dog man a little bit on and 43 and i blended right in between the darkest part of the purple and my skin tone just to give me some more life back into the list because everything was so cool to do starting to look a little more like black I punched me in the eye kind of thing and then it starts to happen had a little more work to look at it will literally save the look I swear to you it will I'm just got more feet and 42 to get a little packing brush and the shade big baby i'm gonna put on the brow bone just a little bit just give me a little bit of a brow lift right here definitely just be careful with that sippy sippy shade because it does have a lot of glitter in it and there will be a lot of follow if you aren't really paying attention I did get a lot of fallout when I was packing it on and it was kind of ruining my makeup so I like three like put on powder on my face just be careful with it's nothing i mean it's a glittery shade most glittering shades out fallout just a forewarning for you guys so we're going to just gonna keep blending out this crease to make sure that there's no harsh edges i wish i had more lid space man this is not another one more let's go into a wing I feel like a wing will also help as well to make something a little more cohesive and blended together so go ahead and doing whatever kind of thing you want to do if not i mean you don't have to of course of course you don't have to because it's just like if you guys want to but i do want to i'm going to take my Kat Von D trooper liner i'm going to create a wing from the bottom of the lash line out words like so what's going to dramatically in that ok just going to start filling that in one family as fuck ok cool so I'm gonna go ahead and finish off with the eyes now I'm going to the bottom of the i originally I was going to do man cat and keep it all clean and purple down here but because i feel like it all started going to mesh together with everything I had a lotta orange and warm , to bring it back to life I'm just going to continue on with the orange and warm tones underneath my lash line just to make sure we don't like clothes off anything and make it look - Mike black I kind of thing so i'm going to mix natural peaches and dog man again on my lower lashline I'm gonna bring that all the way in to make sure everything looks little bit more warm and alive I'll try my best to do like a cool tone look but honestly it's so easy to go from like a cool tone two dead in the second and a fucking second it's so fast ok cool so then I want to have a little bit as well just because we gotta do it we have to do it i'm going to take a more feet m three to six and i'm actually gonna take Gator wings with that in the inner corner just really give me some life back to the eye and waking everything up a little bit on the brow bone as well a very small amount so it's going to take a cream color liner in my waterline which of course you guys can do that would be so absolutely beautiful but because this is great girl as her palate and she's so bold and intense and really really cool imma take a bold water line color I'm gonna take the colour-pop crybaby the lavender pencil I don't put that in my waterline just give me to open the way luckily because it is a light baby lavender color it's still going to open my eyes but not be like the classic wider beige color I don't have been wanting to do some more fun incorporating some more fun colors so this is what I wanted to know so you can barely even tell that it's purple it just looks like a cool lighter color amazing to go and curl your lashes and apply some mascara and policies if you would like okay guys so this is what it looks like with the lashes and lighter and everything is on with mascara and everything they can turn out so freaking cool in its of sexual and like Smokey and very light come hither bitch or you die kind of thing so it looks like i'm going to you guys in to see what they look like up close yeah and and just for reference that the lashes i'm wearing our Russian at black Bayou about some and they have been my favorite lashes recently i just am so loving them so much and they felt they just go with every single look so that's why I don't like them let's go to move on to the lips now so i decided that i want to go in

into it some more about into that she and then blame like a tool 24 outwards blend outwards that kind of gives you like that lifted out for it's getting there we go looking pretty good now we're going to go in with mocha by makeup geek let's lie mean and I know it seems like I'm using a lot of colors but honestly when it comes to smokey eyes like i said before it's all about the transition that's like the most important part in my opinion making look like the very faded and hit ready for heavy it's all about that transition ok back to America from the outer corner into our lashes a little bit huh this is mostly going to go on the outer corner and swept in the little bit you can take it out if you want to try the crispy trick will be using this works okay probably works but I can't do it the first time Christie I believe you I was not going to right now but i believe that works i love you get that 224 blend it all out a little bit now we're gonna go in with a little flat brush and stealth by making me it's like this color is really badass because it's like a good it's like a gray silver that's my blueness to it I don't even know if the camera can tell but it's fucking thing is the first time using it on my lid so we'll see how it goes i'm pretty sure it's gonna go pretty well do as well so i'm gonna got that bad boy on here just off the extra because i really didn't in fact

Real Techniques acting bruise and more and that black cream shadow very lightly put your Han big so you can see that oh ok now get bad little bitch wouldn't go in with that frappe color that we have that we did originally that's cool because I right on top of the black I want this to be mostly a cool tone I and frappes into such a neutral brown I really really wanted that happen and that's why

this full face get ready with me a drugstore addition I'm so excited I'm done drugs for video and so freaking long and i have so many with always request me to do more drug store things so please get ready drugstore addition a blurry all these drugs are probably from me that's why we're going to using two day I'm gonna go in with first the Loreal magic Lumi primer and it's a really good illuminating primer it does give you a nice luminous finish to your foundation and i just noticed that I'm doing more of a mattifying foundation like the t-zone even with this primer i'm good to go to work today so i'll be pretty good perfection so i'm going to go in with the Maybelline matin pour this foundation in the shade 120 and that's gonna be my t-zone foundation and on about it and I'm gonna do something else on the rest of the face is because i have extra just for foundations I want to use them all and honestly like for me I don't know what it is about me but I don't want to do just one foundation on the face like that i always feel like such a mix freak with our nation's collective you you know if you like one foundation for one thing why not use another foundation for something else that you like in a different area so that's why i like to do something to the T zone is completely covered with a foundation and so now for the rest of the face i'm going with the lorio to match a looming cushion foundation which is such a good ass foundation it's absolutely stunning it just gives you such a beautiful like luminous like life like glow to the skin and it's a good nice coverage like medium coverage very buildable it's just awesome so does it suggest this one so you're more on the dry side to this is a great one I'm gonna go with more feet and 4 39 and literally just got soaked her up and we're gonna go in and start buffing this foundation all over the skin and I'm also taking you down the neck as well I don't like doing this or what so ever i'm taking a liquid on the neck hate it but just for the purpose of matching and not having to use another powder I'm just gonna take it down the neck for today ya he fucking so for concealer might take the Maybelline master conceal this is such a good concealer it's like freakishly behind i'm obsessed with it to be honest I'm she needs a little bit of that on my knees a little real techniques sponge to blend it out and amusing about taking sponge just like this take up being like throwing star no that's so cool such a pretty conceal its such a creamy full-coverage concealer like to recommend any to consider for the drugs with nice and full coverage creamy and it really does cover like what you need to get covered maybelline master conceal freakishly bomb and not for the sake of being a brighter I'm gonna take the Loreal magic Lumi pen which is like another listing of highlighting a little . i really do love this pendous works really nicely just so i kinda illuminate a little bit more I really want to do the five minute makeup challenge haven't seen tons of people do it recently about you Jeffrey and Nikki kind of like started the trend up again just because I've been saying it all over the place a little bit more and actually gonna be so fun to do you know what i mean so you guys have any suggestions of any other youtubers that you would like to see me do with the five minute makeup challenge with let a bitch know in the comment box below because that I rockin around but i think that we really really really fine you know it needs a little you guys would want to see me to that way and I think that'd be just such a fun that's a video i've never tried to do a makeup in five minutes I don't know man i feel like i would actually really did terribly but you never know and I want to come on practice or anything I'll be good until i actually have to do it at once that's all blended out nicely i'm gonna take the maybelline fit me powder in the shape 110 which is that the porcelain asked shade just to set the underlying powder this is such a nice finely milled powder and I remember you think I've been doing this one and i think i'm going to try that and so I tried it on my first drug store video and it turned out so nicely and I was like what on my morphe 48 amazing little pointed setting brush so good and for the rest of the face I'm gonna take this big daddy brush the 41 and labeling fit me matan poreless powder because i have two met I just have two of them the freaking bomb i wanted to buy in something you know what these are freaking bomb these powders are super super get their money studio fix powder by Mac but like a cheaper drugstore version of them out i just really like them this is the shade 130 and I'm gonna run that all over the face just to set the rest of the face lightly nothing too heavy just to give me a little bit more coverage as well as set the face for the rest of the day so I never tried this product i really want to try to on camera this is the Maybelline master contour palette ok this is like a nice like contour color blush highlighter todo todo in here is everything and take this on the morphe to the contour color and bronzing up the skin color is just going to be a nerve do you want you know what it fucking works it works it does what we need to do we need to bring up the skin and it brought up the skin that looks a little pinky that i can literally feel like the brown so it's a little pink yeah actually goes a little pinky but you know what we're gonna go with it you know what's cool about these powers over that they're actually very very pigmented like it really has good as pigmentation for sure also i'm using it in the shade medium has any suggestions for any good drugstore bronzers I would be really really cool he doesn't suggest me some that are high quality like good good drugstore bronzers that are not patchy the pigment in there nice and good luck sir roger's I would really love for you guys to suggest me some because i don't have a single job on sir not one not a single charge your browser and I'm like okay I'll just depending on this little master palette to to get me through it but it's not working out for you like it's not really like my clothes I usually like to go in with bronze or whatever but we're going to make it work because I am what unspookable bitch you can't clock me I think you really can but yeah so we're going to go in with the little blushes what - well like the bus is here well they don't you three just kinda just a little bit this looks really pigmented so be careful you want to a nice light flush of it nothing to him it's a nice like matte pink black just a nice pretty color mm thank you and because it's also there we're going to go in with a little highlighter as well this is the highlight number three color and everything down and more for you and 310 fan brush just to highlight the skin she's here let's do it I haven't tried this highlighter you haven't read any of the power yet this is actually a really pretty glowy color it's nice oh yeah that is that that works for me oh hi cool we basically have the face completely done now this is what I'm gonna keep it and I don't really have any more like contouring color to contour my nose because i don't want to turn the fucking weird so this is what we're going to keep it to be a base at I like dr. now I feel like at this face looks nice as clean it looks pretty so we're going to go on to the eyes now the first things first we're going with the brows because the brows are pretty bad right now to grab products that have actually been using for a while now that things are going to mesh well together this but i just want to show you guys what they are I've been using the Maybelline brow drama crayon because i do have browser so i don't really need to do a lot of things I just kind of feel the min ago and the loreal brow stylist plumper which is such a good brow gel its to see amazing so I use the Maybelline thing I literally just right through my brow like this on the areas i have more sparseness this is in the shade and don't know and down on the darkest one and we're just going to push that through the brow anyone have any sparseness as you can see like all right just looks a lot more filled nice bar so that's kind of what i'm doing i was running through with this nice big ol crayon I was going to run a quick believe through my brother though because it is pretty harsh and then the loreal brow stylist plumper going to run that little bridge also this is a really good freakin browser for the from the drugstore it's honestly like impressive like I was genuinely impressed i first tried this I was a day ok and you give a little bit of color excuse me no real excuse the fucking edge and then I'm going to clean them up with a little bit of concealer underneath them to give them more of a sharper appearance and that's it for the out huh so I just found my Milania Luminoso blush really quickly let me just apply that because that's like my favorite drugstore blush of all time is just such a mmm mmm it's so beautiful and so bad now we're going to win the eyes and by the way are primed the eyes off of camera using Maybelline master concealers primer also clean up the brows as well just so I can have a base down first things first with the eyes i'm going with the mix single shadow in the shade so wait i use in my first short story i believe just a nice neutral transition shade on a more 5027 i'm just going to go into the crease just have a base color down first idea what I want to do with the eyes I don't want to be like that everyday average I don't want to be slightly more dramatic so this is a nice really neutral buildable maple brown and i love it the battery got all that drama computer that transfer shit so that is why the computers on and now i'm going with my favorite favorite drugstore shadow formula of all time it is the Loreal infallible shadows after i tried the amber rush color and I did my last tutorial i went out about three but because I was like you gotta be joking me because they're so good so now I'm going today with the shade and bronze taupe such a beautiful creamy buttery consistency it's literally like a foil shadow from the drugstore its ID I don't know how well did it's just such a beautiful consistency and I was going to go on top of my lid just put this nice bronzy taupe color on the lid with your finger suck come on come on I'm shaking this little cleanup morphe brush which is the e28 letting out the edges so there's no hard lines how do we know what I want to do like I just like feel like I'm in like this weird like I just want to know everything great now we have this is just told me top of the high part i want to go on with this next white liquid liner I just kind of wanted to try doing more of a cool different liner I want this look to be different I feel like I've been kind of inner not enough fun but i feel like i've been really into like pinks and neutrals recently so I just want to kind of jump out of my comfort zone and do something that's more fun and so we're going with this when the good liner and create a wing with it and fill it in so now we have the white eyeliner on I felt like it looks a little bit weird I think it was kind of a naked mole rap but it's because my eyeliner on and you're not emphasizing the last year so what you put lashes on it'll be so much better so the liquid liner by NYX you definitely like pile that one on the too late to three layers because it's not when it dries it's not as pigmented as a first goes onstage need to be aware of that and kind of cracks a little bit as well so just be aware that but I don't think it turned out really nicely honestly like I wanted something more bold look on the lower lash line so I'm going to take the next bot pop palette the switch chartreuse color and this man color is coming speaking to me so I want to use those who break them into this looks somehow somebody taking first Lee this shade right here on a just big fluffy brush this is an 18 more feet that's it on the lower lash line on the outside is that a pop of color like this though it's pretty so I'm going with this like really bright chartreuse color on the inner third of that I just to give it more of a bright like ombre effect it look pretty cool so don't take the next train surely liner in the shade black and I'm up with that on the water line gives you an idea or bright colors because i like to emphasize my lower lash line with a black eyeliner but I want my ice to get lost in like the white eyeliner or the color so that's kinda what i'm doing ok like this so far I'm doing in there and when you're doing a white eyeliner I feel like it's very very very important to put on lashes because you want to really define the lash line that it's going to kind of like kind of crazy have you been driving my real lashes for some falsies later on so from a scale already taking the Maybelline lash sensational mascara I've heard really really really great things about this one so I went out and body and it kind of reminds me of the roller lash benefit like applicator it looks looks similar to that play that on the lashes we have a mascara on now I'm not really sure if I like this one for the bottom lashes I feel like I was really do too much for me down there is any suggestions for a really good bottom lashline mascara from the drugstore let us know down there so now we're going with the lashes i'm going to take the lashes at serengeti my new found something that just give me a nice flared outlook and this is what you should have so far now tell me doesn't it with lashes look so much more natural and like it goes so much better together that's all I'm saying I'm telling you guys the lashes really make a huge difference at least emphasizing your own natural lashes when you're doing white liner and your lash lengthening and lost really really easily and your allies in general just get lost so with wearing lashes it's a really important part about this look this is what the little turn out to be and I think it turned out awesome huh millions of you guys in to see what that looks like up close so we have that face and we have the is done let's go ahead and finish off with the lippy or fat lips I'm

i love fall I fall in love during oh no I done fucking lying i don't love anyone was doing started videotaping again we're gonna do a full face using more affordable products so primer so we're going to be using today I'm going to need Knicks pore filler for the team so I'm gonna be taking lorio magic with me for the rest of my face you guys know and love the Laurel magic Lumi I think it works extremely extremely well looks like a well-lit never try this next port filler just have it in my drawer almost looks and feels like the benefit Porefessional so i'm assuming that that's kind of what supposed to act like a lot of reviews online anymore like amazing what they weren't terrible either some students just going to be a chill average pore filling primary i have decided that today even though we are using more affordable product / drugstore products we are going to be looking like fucking top floor walk-up this house do not play me l'oreal lumi do not play me we're gonna be looking fucking snatched I will not let us walk around looking like what's a shady-ass brand that we can compare to I want me some drugs also have amazing things we're not going to walk around like we are fill the blank if you guys are watching this and the comments fill-in-the-blank primed and ready to go not too bad ok so let's move on to foundation i'm so excited so this is the Milani conceal a perfect two and one had not tried this yet I've heard amazing amazing things about it though so i really want to try it out so i bought it um this is actually in my haul video from the drugstore haul a living and use it since then yeah yeah it's that you know I'm actually is 0-2 natural that's when I grabbed i'm praying it will fit me i like that it is a drugstore foundation and has a pump very impressive three pumps think that'll work i can make any foundation color work that's like around my tone as long as they can I highlighting brought up and shit like a fine or put on that little Real Techniques be better version that is yellow that is fucking okay you know what we're gonna make it work we're going to make it work because you know what we are sickening and we are Tim Gunn and we're going to make work oh my god discovered a nice what the fuck my breath but again it is extremely yellow but i think you know what we can really make this work is also blended down the neck and on the ears we can definitely get away with it for sure oh that's kind of burning my fucking mustache area that shaved this morning no do you guys have a trouble finding your shade in this foundation because i feel like this is really dark on my skin I have to put it on my neck which you guys know I don't really like putting foundation on my neck but to make it work we're gonna have to literally 002 I'm assuming is your one is like the lightest shade it goes and then like what the fuck i'm not even like that that ok pretty like I'm pretty freaking light but I'm not like white not like translucent you know so like this might be really tough for you will define the shape than this honestly like this one is beautiful hmm i'm kinda hoping we're going to one more pump want to put it on a little morphe brush this is the East takes one of my favorite that talk of bookies and put up with that mean that fog will lift will let this is gonna be real funny seen that before and after shot yeah okay so the foundation i have to say i'm extremely extremely impressed like do I not look pretty freaking bomb with this donation on the cover just so there and it doesn't feel insanely heavy or anything like I'm really impressed i may have found one of my new favorite drugstore foundations other than Laurel provide available in fact i'm fucking impressed ok so now we're gonna go ahead and do our concealer I'm gonna be taking a mixture of the Maybelline master concealer and the maybelline fit me I love maybe Lincoln soon as I think they actually kill it with concealers and they just looking slim my whole life the fit me is a little more than a medium coverage concealer and the master and feels like a full pass coverage like heavy-duty bitch so I'm just going to mix them both hit me first pitch that motherfucker and then taking a very small amount as you can see right there a very small amount of the master concealed that glam large 1 i'm going with that right closest to where I have the dark circles in the dark color that right there just to help really bright and conceal ok let's go ahead and take real titties brunch brush and sponge combined is brunch at apparently in my mind chuckles and now we're going to take that same real techniques sponge and blend that in really pounce those bad boys together to make like a nice custom coverage nice full coverage is still very brightening and really pretty as you can see look how pretty that is a bitch we are not looking like fucking affordable today we're going to look expensive after that you're gonna have to pay a lot for rent on the hook so now i'm going to take the RCA and no color powder this one is not really found out the drugstore but it's not very expensive it's like 13 bucks it's a very very very good inexpensive option for a great powder to set the face i'm used to bake underneath my highest taking on the world techniques sponge and just pressing that in a really ensuring a nice full coverage set well honey you know we are beautiful we're going to bake like our mother is Betty mother fucking cracker you go ahead big wherever the fuck you want okay i'm gonna bake in the areas like to be a little more bright and the areas that crease on me a ton hey I feel like a little kid some for the rest of things i'm gonna take me cody Eric spun powder this is found at most drugstores is literally like five dollars is absolutely amazing i remember the first time I ever saw cody is when I was watching a drag queen tutorial on youtube because i wanted to i had tried to drag before i got into makeup guy just letting you know it's such a random backstory I tried doing drag want with some friends and i will subtract tutorials and it was just it was not cute my look was not cute I'll try to find photos and insert them but I don't you're welcome because it's not going to be good so I put down our teeth brush and just press that in all over the face this powder smells like your grandma's room if you guys are wondering what this probably smells like it's insane I like the laura mercier translucent much more but if you're on a budget and you want something that's kind of similar and comparable the Cody our spine will be fantastic so now that i'm done pretty much cooking underneath these eyes looking pretty soon I'm gonna take the maybelline fit me powder in the shade 110 is like one of their lighter shades and I just that underneath the iso wipe off any of the excess powder and it's just gonna help to wipe off everything as well as kind of also brighten and then my eyes this is a face powder that gives you like a little bit of a face shine bitches struggling ok cool so now that our faces pretty much set the one thing i will say about the career center that I do not like is that gives you almost like a great cast so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab the Loreal infallible Pro matte powder in the shade 300 which is the same shade that I use for the liquid and I justice all over the face just to kind of give me more of a skin-like appearance again to help dust off the excess Cody are spun powder that's not gonna make a big difference but it is more of a personal preference thing you can just leave it as is with the corresponding but i really do think that gives you weird you a weird huge I just don't really like that's going on anymore pe2 which is what the brush i love to use for bronzer amazing do we are full coverage on this is looking so be right now and this is like affordable in ok now it's time to take some bronzer and bronze up this month we don't look so tasty okay we're gonna take the physicians formula butter bronzer after an amazing things I'm not ready yet i bought this recently no i didnt reason I bought this like months ago and I still have not tried i wanted to try and the video for the first time I'm just got the key to brush run it in here oh my god yeah that sounds like a fucking tropical oasis for real okay we're gonna put that into the bronze the areas of our face huh it's pretty much just as exciting I love it when things work that people say that they're going to work in time it works like it's a fucking bronzer man it looks nice it's like and it's really really neutral it's not too warm it's not too cool which I'm really impressed with oh this smells like fucking in smells like pina colada mix with some fucked-up filled with something in touch with some bean up in that bitch is fucking crazy we're pretty brown sup guys that we are bronzy and this bronzer is not fully mapped by the way this is much more of a satin like real-life bronzer that makes any sense it's a beautiful beautiful bronzer that I have to me it's pretty freaking case i'm going to run that same brush light used to highlight underneath my eyes underneath the bronzer to clean up a very subtle amount nothing crazy that spot right there strikes mean oh ok are amazing for facebook so far bronzed up check full coverage check bitch they're sure it's not for the blush I'm gonna be taking a little bit of the Milani baked blush in the shade bellissimo bronze 06 on aim or 54 and do a little bit of that oh my god that looks pinterest.com come on i'm going to a nice light layer of that really warm up the skin you guys know I love orange Eph blushes like literally everything to me so that's what we're doing to these brushes are fucking pigmented holy shit money i have the that one that's really very popular forgot what it's called but it's beautiful it's fucking stunning it's like they're really popular ones they called don't remember it's wonderful and don't fucking remember i'm sorry but i have that 1i use it actually all the time being so beautiful this one is so pretty it reminds him like a almost more glowy version of my back oh honey bitch is I can be and linked to the ground so now for highlight I got my hands on the wet and wild mega glow highlighting powder so I'm gonna be using that my face two day to highlight this skin this is in the shade that precious petals on a more fiar 12 fan brush and went to put that I've never seen this before either i'm really excited honestly from the fucking drug store this is beautiful so we can all see I have a pimple right here Hypable with all men like hey bruise just let us know it's there I know it's there you don't need to tell me or anything I see the pimple I know it's there ice have texture i told you before I'm a fucking man ok we're going to that are the top . of our cheeks it looks beautiful though mm mm oh my gosh this is so pretty honestly truly honestly true looking really fucking a summary when i'm doing this fall tutorial right now too much about it now again people suffer to set the face I'm gonna take the Loreal infallible makeup setting spaces the only sent away from the drugs that actually enjoying it works pretty well this place on the face to help melt in the powder everywhere let that settle in this b is is there the be fucking there ok now we're going to want to the eyes ok so let's go ahead and do some eyebrows on camera I usually do browse off of camera but i decided that because i am doing more drugstore look / affordable stuff i'm going to the browns on camera at least one maybe house off the camera though I did contour my nose a little bit with that same of butter bronzer gets my nose looks slightly smaller or whatever the fuck it looked you look bigger look smaller I don't know so now for the brow i'm going to be taking a pee loreal brow stylist definer which looks basically like it'd be a little honest arrow is adorable and we're going to be trying this out what she's this shade of dark brunette we're gonna be creating our little brow shape just like I normally would but any other provinces bottom of the brown first hey pretty good that's what is definitely pigment and you can see that i created a little button shape the rest of my brown that's too long honesty is not bad at all does not that at all to me how long does it last on the Browse off the day I have no idea i'm only doing this right now back into safe right now the experience that this goes on my sleeve pigment in its really really easy which I love and yeah it's not too bad let's go into our on the eyes now I'm primed on the eyes the only thing i will guys not affordable in this video entire video is the primary that i'm wearing on my eyes it's the Smashbox 24-hour when it comes to prime around the eyes that's like the one thing I'll not forfeit for like a lower-end one I just think that that one is the best and i can't really stop using it because i'm scared i want another one that was good you know so I'm decided that today I want to do a really cool purple focused look a dramatic one so I grabbed the morphe 35o palette which is the 35 per pod this is going to be great because it has literally every purple fucking shady i need ever and i want to focus everything on the lid color which is the infallible shadowed by L'Oreal and smoldering plum so we're going to be doing something on that lets go and start on with this I gonna be taking this transition shade or right here like a nice basically like peach smoothie looking transition in this is not anymore 5027 working with that into the crease very lightly and just press that in and just using little nice round circular motions to blend everything together the same our transition shade you guys on my status before about more people say it again some of these shades are a serious like bangers like they're so absolutely easy especially for the price . but some of them don't work as immediately as some other ones do so just understand you guys know that some of them off n nominal and some of them are good that's number one ok so just let you guys know I mean for modesty for a pilot for like what 25 bucks hey hold full palette that works very well trademarks that's pretty amazing to me i think so if you're looking for a nice pop and you look purple check out the 35 p because it works very well and it does have every clearly could possibly need as well as the nice transitions that you want in a pallet or just if you want a transition in general so I'm going with more precise brush the morphe e17 and that's going to go more concentrated into the crease really watching building that color up as another transition right on top of the new tape Casey right there two beautiful two beautiful color we're gonna take that out because we are going to be pretty dramatic with this look right there is no denying the fact that Moore has a good shadows like there's no denying it I don't you try talking about morphine say like it's chunky were at the end of the day you can literally swatch it put on your eyes and you'll see that they work if you know what you're doing the work no tea no shade to other shit talkers that can use my favorite shows your hand yeah i guess i'm just going in without you 27 and blending out those shades ok course we have a nice dusty pinkish purple thing going on right now let's go and focus on much more brighter purple and start to really build up that intensity ok now let's go in for even cooking without notice and reboot I'm thinking we're going to go in with this shade and this shade combine these two here and we're going to go ahead and start to the same thing built up that people into the crease nice just like dusty rose kind of thing going on but I really want to make sure that we have this purple moment going on because this look is going to be mostly purple this is a really cool to look for me it's a different okay fine whatever that actually lower than the other shades because this is going to be a great effect and blend out the 27 once more people so now i'm going to take a 36 brush my morphine I'm gonna take this really pretty maroon burgundy shade right here it's a little darker it's much more warmer maroon brownish shade up with that lowest of all the colors and really start to build that up as well because i'm going to do a really dark lid i feel so I'm going to really make sure that it looks intense all the way over $OPERAND minutes and it's able to blend in easily into the next shades going up you can see I'm building right here and I'm really just looking up while doing this so i can see exactly where I want to place the product as you can see it's already starting to dig deep and darken up nicely same 317 blend out those edges again between each step I take that you 17 and blend out one more time and now for the fun part we're going to go ahead and put on the lid color i'm taking a Maybelline 24-hour tattoo crayon and this is a lilac dust shade everybody going over with the Laurel shot on top just press it in i think this is would be a nice base color it is going to be a little bit lighter than the shadow or go in with but i don't know i just want I just saw it and I thought it would be nice for a base somewhere that crayon all over the lid wherever it is exposed and really have a nice pretty color down that's beautiful and i'm taking a more 5032 and blending out cream so it's not as intense looking it's not so like a line basically ok cool so now it's going to apply this L'Oreal infallible eyeshadow and shape smoldering plum this is the morbid dark shade it's almost black with like purple reflect on it waiting on a 32 my morphe same brush we just used to blend out those edges are just going to pack that on right on top of the base was a beautiful and it's really just start to build slowly and pat on so there's no major fallout smoking is not playing any games cause i love the color packed on exactly where we want it to we're gonna go ahead and blend out the edges of that color with that statement 36 you don't have any additional product we're just going to blend out that little harsh lion there's no harsh lines or any edges for this look we want to look really seamless and blend it out to perfection just keep on blending until we got online are actually have no hand is not have the top of the ice done this is basically what i want to have it i think they look really nice blend very well enough it looks blended on I'm gonna go back in without wet-and-wild highlighting powder really quickly the same one I used earlier on a small morphy am3 26 I'm going to pack that on the inner corner of my eye to help brighten everything as you can see it's beautiful it's nice like champagne shade and also on the brow bone of course highlighting the brow bone whenever i do it ok I like this what's more of an intense smokey eye i really wanna make sure i'm highlighting the top points of my eye because it's really easy for I to look so closed off you know I'm saying quickest what it looks like nice and highlight did start to build up the color on the lower lash line like I did on the top something that nice arose that pedal shade right here i want to put that on the lower lash line to see if there's any of the darker shades left on this precious all good because you're really going to building up darker shades anyway so she does really matter so now going back in with a vibrant purple shade right there i'm going to be taking that money more 5043 really start to build up the intensity on the lower lash line and make that really cool purple pot this look is fantastic of you have green eyes blue eyes any kind of colored eyes even brown eyes this is such a pretty look it's gonna really complement so many different kind of eye colors i just love it so much so when that really bright purple all the way in right story but the highlight because it is gonna be smoking all the way around now to really make sure everything is intense and smoky still we're going to take that darkest shade right here i'm going to put that closest to the lash line and really start to define the lower lashline really well to make sure it's really close to the lash line really pushing that in because of course closest election at the top is really dark as well and we're going to blend out with that you 36 make sure it doesn't look too hard place and now we have that down the go ahead and line up the waterline with this pencil by Maybelline is the Maybelline New York lasting and drama waterproof gel pencil in the shade polished em amethyst what the fuck in the shade and polish amethyst yeah so i'm going to put that on my waterline and just go ahead and brighten everything up because this is very bright intense looking for i think i'm attorney let's trade oh I just feel like because we are doing a purple look I wanted to keep it in that purple family that's pretty that's really pretty because I now we're gonna play some mascara advertisement for this is the new maybelline the falsies push-up angel then general oh this is very confusing doesn't want to see this okay well we're gonna try to help ok those lashes okay honestly I'm not mad this mascara at all it works pretty freaking well I have really bad lashes guide I i have laughed at that point straight down the short it's just not a cute look at this one I feel like because this the one is so tiny it really did help separate my lashes and push them upwards and notice a difference for real because you there was another mascara automatically apply some falsies I grabbed from I lower the vegas name lashes i got these at ulta and I figured I was gonna do a lash it's not as expensive as last night usually where i always wear like me glasses that are just a nice intense wispy pair but this is a great lash for not too much things like seven bucks and so we're gonna play the / on his eyes and that is it for the final i love this is what they look like what the lashes on things now that we have the face and the eyes completed i'm gonna go ahead and do the lips real quick and of course we're going to be taking a more affordable option lipstick as well so because my eye is really purple it's literally just you know it's purple right away i was going to go with the neutral and just keep it nude and move on but i really want to switch up the look and touch come out of my comfort zone a little bit and put a more dark nude on the lips so what I decided to go with his kathleenlights is at point zero lipstick also satin lip with color pop I've done this before and i love it so much it's a beautiful shape i think with this look going on it's neutral enough to work but it's still like not a nude as much if that makes any sense so we go ahead and apply this on the EDX I'm so cool tones like the coolest ever been and this is the final look and that is it you guys that is it for the entire video i hope you guys enjoyed this fun dramatic fall and makeup tutorial and i know this is like a fall look that's much more of a cool tone side i will be of course doing more fall looks that are more warm tone and more just different talents you guys have any ideas of what you guys would like me to do with a look

video is going to be kat von d cosmetics because you guys chose kat von d in my last video I asked if you guys wanted to see Mac or kat von d for the next one brand tutorial after I didn't mix and benefit so if you haven't seen those videos yet i'll leave a link down below as well i'm doing a series on my channel where I'm doing one brand tutorial i'm doing an entire look on just that one brand and I think it's been going really well so far and i love it and i think this will come out really really nice and it's all Kat Von D and kevin is one of my favorite brands like that is so that's before I think it's so awesome I think it's really cost efficient it's not super super super expensive but it's also really high quality but yeah this is what they came up with this is like a router smokey eye with a nice bold coral pink lip and I think about really nice is a great look for spring or summer you want to feel it a little more on the bold side but still wanted to be like still like glue and spring and summer mean you know Sam yeah that's what kind of video do not fucking watch it but yeah other than that I'll get you guys to the tutorial and I will catch you in my next video that's not true no see you guys soon okay okay so we're gonna start on to see all that yeah I don't know what that is or some other clean face i re-watched and I moisturize so we're good to go so it's going to head yeah i'm gonna start with the kat von d lock-it featherweight primer this is a water-based primer it is extremely like liquidy I've used it once before and it wasn't like anything amazing i wasn't like super shocked and amazed by it but it does feel super nice on the skin and now we're going to take the kat von d block information and the shape 48 light I think this is my color shape is literally shellac is fucking will go virtual my god it's really intense so I'm gonna take a little bit my finger is going to Pat it i'm going to be using a beauty blender with us because this is a very full coverage mattifying foundation and I want to share it out maybe slightly I don't want to look like Sherlock on my face I don't want to look too cakey and I think using a beauty blender with this foundation specifically really really really makes a huge huge difference huge difference to use the beauty wonder if it doesn't load it slightly not too much but like very slightly diluted it is full coverage this is not coffee face like if you were to put this bitch on it is not coming off your finger this is an amazing foundation for like an event or if you're going out like to the club and you get oily oh my god this bitch is not coming up even if you like dancing you're fucking booty popping and like grinding on some homes like this shit is not leaving literally take a little bit of ears on your neck a little bit i don't have it he how to hurt someone you can take this shit down my neck and I'm going to take the locket a concealer and light 16 which i think is the lightest color going to be a very tiny amount and i'm going to Pat it where I have the most amount of darkness and bring it out and then right away i'm going with the Beauty Blender this is a full-coverage concealer so you really really really want to go in quick to blend it out and to set it because it will increase if you do not set it will take a little bit on the lids two of two prime for the shadows are going with option to set it right away quickly and i'm going to be Kat Von D shade light with my favorite powder contour and highlight it of all time I'm take the light and shade on a more fee and 438 you guys know this better than an obsession I'm just set the under eye with it right away I like to just set it right away i'm not going to do the other eye was can see the first i'm setting the fish first and my life as well and then we'll go in with you can see that on the other side conceal conceal don't feel i just realized i lost and eat my earring holy shit ok problem partially solved that were concealed when you go back in with a more the g7 and the shade light palette we're gonna take that middle in the middle seen worse things that to bronze up to face i love this metal shape color because it's beautiful warm terracotta color like this foundation dries to a matte finish so you don't need to worry about like sitting at you really don't it's pretty sick that want to our car color and just blend into the skin it's so you have all the same thing on the cheeks have went a little heavy handed as you can see the palate is very pigmented i am absolutely obsessed yeah problems are gonna take a whiter shade when I put it in the center of the forehead to bring a little bit of lightness to the face in the center now i'm gonna take my makeup geek rounded blush brush and the he this shit right here is my favorite contouring brush you can take that at the base of my ear talking about your down to start bluffing bluffing that in and just really start buffing that into the skin it's a little more cool tone than the terracotta color that we were here first so yeah so yeah a little bit of the temples as well just give you a little bit more of a dainty full head which looks to me like this pretty easy huh so now i have a base down I'm gonna go into the eyes right now I'm actually gonna do my brows off camera because i don't think anybody has

go into a sigma e40 and blend that out even more oh they blend so nicely to handle one today yeah it's looking pretty fucking easy I'm going to get a nice chocolate brown shade on the same for 33 and I'm gonna run that on the outer corner lower than I have that Warren chain I'm not just going to go into our lash line almost as well in our crease I'm sure to make a copy and outer V with this you want to be too neat i kinda wanted to be a little bit smoky and messy and i'm just going to take that and 43 and just go over the brown and the orange again with no additional product i'm just literally blending the two together p for t sigma and not again that's not going to take a sigma e30 pencil brush and that black shade the slightest amount of it because it is so pigmented like bitch I say this to maintain and i'm just going to roughly run it into the ground as well making a cute little V and then take a clean brush any commercial work i'm taking morphine 441 and blend all that together about the item me nice and neutral but still with a little pop of orange and warmth to it and she looks like this very neutral kind of outer smokey eye going on grab any kind of packing brush

chocolate brown we're gonna run that underneath the lash line close to the lash line and we don't want to be too into intense but i do want a little bit of definition down here and slightly further forward vary slightly but I want to most the most definition beyond the outer corner and then blend that out the little more food pencil brush very slightly so now i'm going to the other eye off

trina everything else I've tried but not dangerous the one is fucking crazy shit is huge and notice right away is that it makes my lashes really skinny but it makes them really dark too so it's good

at this look at a couple videos already and I can be getting tons of requests to film this look which is like this deep purple smokey eye kind of thing going on and I was like finally I just like you don't you sit down finish in the previous videos I was running a different list but i decided to pair with this very pale pink nude lip this is like really late for me so i don't know how i feel about yet it's very like who like the light as hell it's cool to do different things sometimes and this is so light but who cares fuck it thug like you know you don't like it so fucking watch it don't know yet if you don't see how I could this look with the eyes and the lip please continue to watch I don't know this but yeah other than that I'll see you soon and yes it's cool so we're going to do first we're going to start with pro longwear concealer by Mac as our primary already put on my lids are nice and primed and I said it with the translucent powder is Grant's a primer because it has technology to increase and it kind of covers of all your let your veins and disclosure anything like that so this is a great base for eyeshadow i use it all the time like always loved me ok cool so let's go into this purple smokey look because you guys wanting so we're going to start and we're going to go in with of course the target pal you guys know this is the college I used to create the look that we created so let's go ahead and do that smoky ship first things first what we're going to do is we're going with the d40 x sigma of course because no my favorite thing in the world and we're going to go in with this shade and this shade and that's going to our transition shades so that means that we're going to put those down first and then the other clothes going to be blending into that ok that's going to increase I'm just gonna make everything a lot easier to blend out in the long run you don't need to be neat just toss that bitch and I'm gonna grab a flat brush like any kind of flat brush I'm going to go in with the lightest shade here we're going to put our problems are broad highlight yes brow bone now we're going to go in with a mixture of caregiver and best friend which of these two right here on the same me 4043 did right to both that's going to increase area a little bit lower than our transitions that we have a nice little transition color we have a little purple that's crazy but it's a little-known I am so now we got more feet and 43 just like my favorite morphe brush of all time and then we're going to go ahead and just go we're gonna just go in with this color right here and that's when go into our lower crease and its really blend it into the crease nice and softly keeping your eyes open for this you can see where you want the color to be deposited are going to get all the way in now going with e-40 again and just blend away any edges that I might not like with no additional product at all so now we're going with the fun part we're going to go in with bombshell which is this dark purple Clary hear that same morphe brush just get a good amount on like that that's off the excess and now we're going to place into our crease we're gonna put that in our outer corner first and then we're going to put into our crease and this is busy going to be our outline for smokey eye so we're going to go into the crease and outer corner right over that previous color then we go back in with a 40 and blend away the harsh like you can see a little harsh edge between my transition in the purple you want that to be almost completely diffused so now we're gonna go in with a morphine 320 any flat brush will work totally fine and then we're going with that bombshell color again right here loaded in and now we're going to hurry back on eyelid more densely towards the lash line and then we're getting up to the transition color I'm going a little bit softer that mytouch is a little bit softer because I want to be more diffused the higher we go so then we're gonna go ahead and grab that same morphine for 33 and with no additional product and blend the edges where my late color meets the transition color should look something like this so I'm gonna go in with a black eyeliner I'm going in with the LA girl very black eyeliner and that we're just focusing on the inner corner or in a room of our I smoking stock and then we're gonna go back in with that deep dark plum color on a sigma e 15 which is like those kinda the flat shader brushes and that we're gonna run by lash line very close to the lash line so now we're going to go back in to the palate we're going to dip into let me get a different 2 free spirit claret here and the one next to it and then we're gonna blend underneath that deep dark purple same brush we're going to go in with the lightest color and go underneath that yeah not so panicky like the last one huh like that we have this nice dark deep purple smokey and then just go and tell us a little bit more of the light color right here so really highlight it and this is what that looks like i'm gonna go into that off camera click and I'll be right back okay cool now we have both eyes done like shadow wise we haven't done like the lashes and shit like that we're going to lashes let's go and curl our peeps right yeah we're doing falsies anyway so it is really matter about tonight's news and I'm like how to

my two biggest platforms I like to like go on constantly they feel like I can link up with that shit the most teams I'm tell me what you guys want to see next I love you guys comments us know that you guys on my next video hey guys welcome back to mastering the art of today we're going to talk about you guessed it cushion compact everything you need to know about which is the best cushion to look for the best color for your skin type and the best techniques have fun and of course good luck don't worry if you're new to cushion compacts here's a quick one on one they originated from Korea and normally they provide a lightweight sheer coverage the packaging as you can see here is bulkier than your average compact because it has to create an airtight seal to keep your cushion fresh if you look inside you'll find an applicator which is usually a dense antibacterial circular sponge like this in a porous sponge that soaks in foundation BB or CC cream here's my favorite pro tip just like how you're flipping the matches to turn the bed flip the sponge when the product starts to run low it's kind of like go on up for the sponge the application is pretty universal all you have to do is load the applicator sponge and start blogging onto the skin in small even paths choosing the right cushion compact all comes down to selecting the right finish and coverage for your skin tone and type if you have fair skin then you know the struggle of finding product that matches your complexion when I say fair I mean skin that is paler than a ghost so pale that your face is naturally blown out in flash photos but it's all good because those of you with fair skin have a decent range of brands to choose from many of my favorites are from South Korea if you have a light to medium 10 skin town you have a lot of options to play with a lot of the Korean brands will carry only a few shades that generally fall in the light to medium skin tones here are some of my favorite brands to check out because cushion compact is relatively new and face makeup unfortunately shade range is limited but there are brands who carry shades for deeper tones cushions are also available in color correction shade yellow helps with discoloration purple combats dullness peach brightens dark circles and green neutralizes redness now we can move on to recommendations for different skin types when selecting the cushion compact for dry skin instead of finding one that is foundation based look for one that is BB or CC cream based for application use a good moisturizer and hydrating primer you can even spray a moisturizing toner on your application sponge before applying in order to keep your skin hydrated and the foundation from settling into fine lines from here just continue building your desired coverage by adding thin layers i recommend pressing and lifting like this to avoid streaks and dry patches here are some of my pics for dry skin when it comes to selecting the cushion compact for combination skin you have a wider range to choose from since you can tolerate compacts for dry and oily skin for application start by applying your cushion compact around your jawline and cheeks building coverage as you go from there damn around the t-zone area with the Beauty Blender in order to avoid build up and once you're done immediately set this area with powder for a flawless finish here are some bread that you can try out for combination skin if you have oily skin be aware that cushion compact are not the best choice because of their duty finishes no worries though there are cushion compact for you just try and find one that has a mattifying or satin finish stay away from the ones with hydrating benefits and look for one that has a lightweight formula when it comes to application start by using your favorite mattifying prime something like milk of magnesia that will soak up the oil on your t-zone and keep him at throughout the day after building your desired coverage finish off with a mattifying spray and apply translucent or mattifying powder to keep your skin looking fresh here are my recommendations for oily skin both acne in mature skin are grouped together here because both types require extra attention the trick is to keep your skin balance you want to look for cushion compacts with added skincare benefits and stay away from heavy formulas with harsher ingredients for application start with the primer to help smooth out fine lines or blemishes from here you can apply with a damp sponge to avoid excess product in fine lines be sure that you're applying in thin layers because most of the formulas are sheer you may have to touch up with a spot concealer unblemished areas yeah once you're done with the application finish off the hydrating setting missed and here are some brand recommendations oh and special thanks to everyone who was in this video we decided to show up and show their face without makeup lending me their beautiful faces you can follow them on their social which i will add right here and here and here and here thank you so much for watching this video guys i hope it inspired you to find your best

forever load it up with your brush and start applying it on your browse you can see here that every stroke I make I'm spreading the product out what i'm doing here is reshaping my brows and you can reshape them into any brow shape you like for this look I decided to keep my brows straight and full with a very minimal arch this will give me a more sophisticated look if you look at actresses like natalie portman jennifer connelly Audrey Hepburn and even Lily Collins they tend to sport a strong set of fuller straighter browse and you can see that they're known to have a classy elegant look let's take a shimmering peachy pink eyeshadow color I'm using here the NYX eyeshadow in Fahrenheit just apply this on your lid try and keep the concentration around this area from here you can keep layering and layering until you've reached the maximum color payoff and you can apply with your clean ring finger it's just as good as brush mmm no you my friend all right now take a navy color with a pearl finish and loaded up on your brush and add this color on the outer third of your eyes you want to work your way along the natural contour of your eyes keeping most of the concentration along the outer edge now take a blending brush and with a dabbing motion blend the navy blue color with the peachy pink color this is going to help create a beautiful ombre effect with the smaller brush just pick up the same peachy pink color and apply this along the lower lash line stopping halfway all right now we can pick up a sparkling angel dust eyeshadow color look for a shimmering pearl shadow with gold flakes just tap this along the inner part of your eye this is going to create a beautiful luminous effect and also the vampire - of this I look apply a row school color along your waterline to brighten up the color of your eyes and let's just say you're not a fan of using white eyeliner try rose gold instead it's a softer more romantic color just apply this on your waterline to create a

just apply generous coats of this baby on to your lashes so keep building up your lashes until you're satisfied with the length and volume moving on to bring more definition to my face I'm going to use my contouring and highlighting state called kiara scooter where one side is the contouring shade and the other side is the highlighter with a contouring shade draw too skinny lines down the sides of your nose and just bring it back up towards your brows and when you're done with that take your finger and blend the line to soften it another do come and let's just say you want to create the illusion of a lifted nose shadow under the tip of your nose think of it like creating the letter U and just blend it's kind of like a nose job in seconds it's crazy what contouring can do from here

tear for the brows same thing straight in a little angled if his brows are super dark and jet-black try and lighten them just a bit for the eyes just apply eyeliner on the bottom part you basically

forget to check out if see com seductive look is inspired by the lax brought to life by the flamenco dancers of Spain fierce in passionate like a row center thorns this is the spanish we all know that every great masterpiece begins with a flawless canvas let's begin by applying a lightweight CC cream which will smooth and hydrate your skin if you're looking for a sheer natural coverage cc or BB cream is the way to go just blend everything away with your clean fingers and let's move on see this concealer i made this so that you can cover up anything hence the name because BB and CC creams are so sure it might not be able to cover up dark circles or smaller skin blemishes so that's why spot treating these little imperfections with your concealer is so crucial you can either use your clean fingers or a brush to blend the concealer notice how I'm making this dabbing motion instead of dragging the brush to blend dab instead you'll notice the concealer blames faster and it's more gentle on the skin unless your foundation and concealer has a powder finish set everything with a translucent loose powder the powder will keep the makeup lasting longer anything within a Molly and texture will move increase into your fine lines and that's why powder will prevent this from happening and before moving on to the eyes just apply a little bit of attempted red lip balm which will help moisturize your lips so they're primed and ready for lipstick cool time for the fun part the eyes start with the metallic purple color on the center of the lid if you look closely the shade has many dimensions to it which will complement the other purple and gold colors that we're going to be applying later we call this dual chrome next use a shadow brush and apply a light wash of this pale lavender shade across the lids blending as you go do you see the dabbing motion again you have more control if you doubt the eyeshadow on instead of brushing it on pick up this / lavender color and accent the inner corner of the eyes this will give your eyes at hint of pastel color it's time to shadow in the bottom lashline pick up this metallic berry shade and bring the color up along the lower lash line and into the eye socket to create definition and dimension if you want a romantic smokey look build up the color intensity don't just tackle it on it's all about layering and creating a very slow buildup you'll have more control this way and just blend the contour shade so that it doesn't have a hard edge to really make your eyes appear fiery and alive take a sparkling blue shadow and gold and line the bottom lash line from the inner corner to the middle of the eye doing this will give your eyes that multifaceted look so every time you move the shadow will change with the light lastly use the light purple shadow on the brow bone which will blend away any harsh lines and create that hazy school on to effect because this look is bold and adventurous your liner should mirror that so don't be shy before beginning make sure your liner is sharpened for more precision when lining you also want to make sure that your black liner has a more creamy texture not the hard pencil one because we are going to lunge this baby up start at the outer corner of your eyes and work your way in and don't forget to line the water line to help intensify the look with the smudger brush or if you have the water liner pencil flip it over and use the smudger tool smudge the eyeliner would do so gently don't drag it on your eyes try and use a gentle patting motion keep doing it until you get this smoky effect no black eyeshadow needed just a creamy black eyeliner cool all right onto the brows I like to use to brow pencils to create my natural brow look and the reason being is because your brow hairs are made up of so many different colors and I like to keep the lighter color along the head of my brows and a darker color along the tale of my brows so fill in your brows and cover up any sparse areas honestly the brows are the most important step to any of their makeup routine so don't skip this step unless you have perfectly shaped browse lucky you now grab your mascara and go to town the more coats the better and if you need to add fake lashes we want sky-high lashes so that every time you blink it's like a gust of wind blowing away yeah now your eyes are perfect yeah to create sensual looking skin try using a skin illuminator the one that i'm using here is called golden hour so look for where the natural light hits your cheekbones and apply the illuminator around this area when it comes to creating the illusion of good skin it's all about texture and light so the more light you bring onto your face the more your club but not too much you don't want to look like a light bulb you can see how do we and healthy my skin looks now all make it my dear he had a screw an Italian art term that means light and shade and that's what we're going to be doing here use the shadow to contour the areas on your face that you want to recede I like to contour the sides of my nose to elevate it if you want to contour properly you have to find the right color and texture it has to be a neutral medium brown shade and the texture has to be Matt this will give you the most natural look once you've mapped out your face just blend wait I wanted to make sure that this formula blends effortlessly no brush or sponge needed just your warm clean fingers see how you look with subtle and intense contouring you'll never know how you look until you try and unlike contouring highlighting is when you want to make features on your face stand out so I'm gonna do this on the bridge of my nose now it's time to create your kiss of fire a bold red lip is one of the most powerful iconic beauty look that anyone can rock you just have to find the right shape that fits your undertone best or you can customize and build your own color if you have a cooler undertone find a Red that has a blue tone in it if you have a yellow undertone find a way that has a warmer toning and if you're not really sure a neutral red color is usually the safest bet you want better precision use a brush when you're applying your red lipstick so that you can paint on your perfectly sculpted red lips yeah la your beautiful look is finished this look is perfect for dance it's sultry and bold when in doubt just make the space or stick your nose in between your deep yummy rose petals they don't taste as sweet as they look yeah you could have fun and good luck don't forget to check out my makeup line and at em cosmetics calm and my blog updated daily at Michelle Phan com what's that majestic human I always believed how a new year is kind of like a blank canvas and I like to celebrate this idea by enhancing my favorite features the clean and fresh beauty look anyone of all ages can wear this look let's begin with a clean canvas before I attack my face of makeup I always like to start with a clean face to remove makeup residue use a makeup wipe to reveal is squeaky clean surface if you prefer using a non oil based makeup remover chlorine makes one that's enriched with corn flower extract i know not everyone has five minutes to spare but if you do show your face in love by nurturing it the deep hydrating mask stress can tire the body and it reflects on the face so finding any bit of relaxation helps and substituting a traditional moisturizer for dewy skin missed instead my favorite one by tata acts like a primer and illuminator it helps reduce any dry patches on my skin try not to neglect your lips especially if you're wearing a lot of liquid lipsticks many can be drawing so be sure to exfoliate your lips from time to time mmm this sugar lips crab tastes pretty good ok finally we can begin with makeup I like to use concealer first and spot treat any blemishes quality concealers are hard to come by when you do a little goes a long way spot treat and gently Pat like this to blend from there I like to even out the area around my nose and mouth because of excess redness moving onto the ice load up your brush with a light camel color and begin making a subtle pseudo cut crease try not to create a harsh line like a traditional countries make it feathery take a mat charcoal color loaded up with a tiny angled brush get close to your eyes notice how this gives an illusion of a thicker lash line when doing this just be sure to use a light hand with the same brush begin to feather out the darker color along your lash line sweep it out into a wing this will help elongate the shape of your eyes so from here just grab more color and begin to intensify the wing taking your time in starting lightly allows you to build up the intensity in layers now using a small eyeshadow brush loaded up with a warm earth tone shadow and begin to line the lower lash line like this I know this beauty style looks pretty simple but you'd be surprised the most simple and natural looks actually require the most time because of the blending layering and feathering and once you're done just blend it out with a fluffy brush yes there is such a thing as a sailor moon liquid eyeliner and I have to say it's one of my favorite liners i'm going to use this one over the previous eyeliner to sharpen line begin tapering out the line little by little to create a tapered . this will provide the most line control giving you the perfect wing ok let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the wraps first I'm going to use a powder to create the base for my brow shape if you wanted to look natural the powder finish should be mat from here I like to layer a pencil over creating hairlike strokes make feathery marks like so and blur the lines by combing is glee through your brows using your favorite lash curler my holy grail issues press firmly against the roots of your lashes and trying to pinch yourself keep pressing from root to tip to get the best holding curl all right now you can tight line your eyes using a warm brown eyeliner the definition it gives goes well with the color you already placed on your lower lash line now you can fuck up your lashes with generous coats of mascara I know for some people the idea of sweeping mascara through the lashes seems terrifying but honestly for me every time I swipe it's such a satisfying feeling i know im so weird so I found the best full lashes for Asian eyes they're called diamond lash and i discovered them in Tokyo first off the reason why they're so amazing is because they're super easy to peel off and I don't have to cut down the link the band is super thin and it fits perfectly for Asian eyelids BAM look how natural this looks okay once your lashes are set give them one more curl to get them all perky and excited and now you got some body lashes I like to powder when i'm almost done with the makeup because it helps maintain the freshman's look at how pretty this gradient blushes it's not your basic blush color but it's wearable watch use a brush or contour brush and sweep it back and forth to load it up with the color pop this on to your cheeks I softly blending out towards your temple all right you should be a magical now but if you're craving more dimension lightly contour use a matte neutral bronzer in the hollows of your cheeks and dust the rest around your upper hairline to balance out the face I was done finish off the look with the sultry path profit with lip liner if needed and top it off with a gradation liquid lipstick all right now you're done enjoy your body self love you good luck yeah hi need help on doing makeup for pictures no worries because i'm here to help before anything apply lip balm on your lips to get them nice and moisturized let's move on to sense came to avoid that white cast look you know when your face is white and the rest of your body is normal tone you want to use a chemical sunscreen instead of a physical sunscreen basically avoid using a sunscreen with titanium dioxide and or zinc oxide select a photo friendly foundation basically a foundation with low SPF anything below spf20 should be fine because again it won't leave your face with that white cast as you guys can see I have a little bit of redness going on my skin so I'm going to use this mint green cover stick from Maybelline what it's going to do is that it's going to neutralize the redness on my skin I know it's a little weird kind of like I'm turning myself into the Wicked Witch of the West but as you guys know green and red are complementary colors they neutralize each other out so that when you apply foundation concealer on top of the mint green color you won't see any redness yeah and as you guys can see my skin looks even to combat zombie eyes just add a little bit of concealer around your eye area with your ring finger maybe we shall try and sleep a little more if we don't want RBIs for the face i'm going to use a matte powder to set my makeup i'm going to start around my under eye area and then move towards the rest of my face kylie i know it's safe no we don't with using a white or nude matte eyeshadow loaded on your finger and make a stroke on the bridge of your nose then blend away sometimes shimmer can make your face look like it's a little oily we want to try and keep your entire makeup as mad as possible all right now it's time for eyeshadows I'm going to stick with the good old foolproof neutral eyeshadow palette you first want to use the new color as your base color apply it on your legs with a brush to clean finger next step use a matte taupe color as a contour shade and then blend away taupe is a wonderful color to use if you want to come to your eyes without making it look too happy never be now take a white eyeshadow or pencil and highlight the inner corners of your eyes this will open up your eyes more you know photograph beautifully yeah yeah take a black eye shadow and line your eyes keep the line as soft as possible who and if you want add lower lashes to create an illusion of bigger eyes so now we can layer a liquid liner on top of the soft I later that you just made keep the line as thin as possible what yeah with the eyeliner done you can now curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for mascara add as many coats of mascara as you need personally I need extra help so I'm going to use fake lashes to add more drama to my eyes find fake lashes that go with your eye shape thumbs up if you guys would like me to do a video on finding the right fake lashes for your eyes the thing about love isn't love side come we're almost done with the eyes all you have to do is just fill in your brows I decided for this look I wanted my brows to look fuller I find that when I have fuller browse I tend to look more youthful and sweet is this true human you want and don't forget to use brow gel this will keep the stray hairs in place yeah just let alone yeah I kind of like to do a little picture test around this time just to see how I'm doing and I decided to Instagram is too I noticed from the photo that my nose lacked a little bit of definition so i decided to contour it by shading the sides of my nose with a matte bronzer or taupe eyeshadow perfect and now it's time for blush and bronzer contour cheeks and add extra color to them because in flash photography it can sometimes remove twenty percent of color and intensity from your makeup usually when i'm doing makeup for flash photography I like to use a heavier hand for the lips I decided to line my lips for fuller looking smile yes we're almost done just finish off with the lip color of your choice I decided to mix up my own color a nude pink shade well and now that my face is done i'm going to finish off this look with the hair braid one side of your hair like this any braids will do for me is a little lazy i'm just going to stick with the traditional raid yeah and when you're done reading just tuck it in the back and take a bobby pin and pin it in place that's it I know it's super easy right here are some extra tips if your eyes get red before the photoshoot use eye drops this will make your eyes appear brighter refreshing oil blotting sheets are a must before you take that photo blog any excess oil instead of powdering your face you don't want to over mattify your face or else your face will lack definition for me I like to stay away from dangling earrings because it can shorten the length of my neck small earrings like these are cute and will always be in fashion mmm what to wear since most likely you'll be photographed from the waist up Lucas more around this area maybe you can try and find a pretty neckline or play around fun colors and if you're wearing glasses make sure they're non-reflective and there's nothing wrong with keeping it casual intricate necklines are great if you want to bold luck and if you want more focus on your lower neck area where a scoop neckline with fun patterns this will open up your neckline or maybe you can start for that scarves are so fun to wear perhaps you're feeling a little edgy don't be afraid of spikes hopefully you won't get in trouble for wearing this because it could actually hurt someone and I'll also be doing a DIY video and how to spike up your jacket the next video will be about posing for the camera and finding your best angle stay tuned and i hope this video was really helpful good luck everyone and have a fun picture day music by mari Dickie and if you can please subscribe yeah yeah yeah mmm gorges here's a beautiful edgy look for you to experiment with this fall highlighted cheeks straight brows framing tapered smokey eyes paired with the peach nude or fibrin glue it oh and shout out to my designer friend at human aliens for making the sick body suit he combines my two favorite things fashion and Anna me ok let's get started before you beat your face with makeup you want to make sure you have a clean smooth canvas to work on this is why exfoliating is essential you can either use a gentle scrub to polish off the skin or my favorite way a gentle exfoliating peel like this one by skin inc so i've been using this product for over a year and I loved it so much I had to get it seemed to sample it in the glam bag all you have to do is apply this product on your face and you'll notice right away your dead skin peeling off the kind of look like a racer crumbs weird and kind of gross but it pays off from here just rinse your face and now touch your skin it should feel baby butt smooth this is my favorite hydrating skin missed no joke I wasn't paid to see any of this this dewy skin mist has saved my skin because it's so dry in LA after a few good sprays my skin instantly looks and feel supple for this look I decided to go for straight brows with no arch so that means i'm going to cover up the corners of my brows i'm just going to use concealer but i recommend using either non-toxic glue stick or spirit gum with wax for a more realistic look however for the sake of this tutorial and me not wanting to remove the glue from my brows I'm just going to opt for concealer you guys get the picture for my brows i'm applying a soft mix of hazel and dark brown matte shade with an angled small brush draw a straight edge using the inner corners as a guide I'm tapering line upwards this will create an illusion of the lifted face for your eyes warm up some concealer between your fingers and use it as an eyeshadow base use loose final powder on a fluffy brush to set the concealer on your lids this will reduce any creasing using the same brush apply a dark brown color to the outer corner increase using a window wiper motion you can create a lot of depth and dimension with just one that color it's all about layering and how hard or light or application pressure is now with a metallic burgundy eyeshadow and using a small shadow brush pack this color onto your outer eyelid you want to concentrate the color as close to your lash line as possible to create more depth using a tightly packed blending brush blend out with the darkest color extending it to the crease and right underneath the eye from there find a warm tan color and blend this color under your eyes to balance them out with the same burgundy color accentuate the corner of the under eye and from there to sweep the shadow into a tight wing using the fine details angle brush get your wing just the way you want it and once you've sculpted out the shape you like clean the edges with a makeup brush for that precise edge ok let's take a break from the eyes onto the face take a rose gold cream shimmer and lightly Pat onto the apples of your cheeks for that base glow and from there using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream spot rate your face to reduce redness or blemishes so that your skin tone is even and natural-looking if you're more into that poreless flawless face find a foundation that has a high coverage if you're like me and you prefer a natural skin finish use a BB or CC cream that has a light to medium coverage apply a light hydrating lip gloss and let it soak into prep your lips with the same loose powder from before using a smaller face brush loaded up and feather over any shiny area okay now back to the eyes using your favorite eyeliner pencil or any liner that has a small brush sharpen the wing and line the eyes one trick that I like to use is to start at the inner edge of the line and apply in small strokes keeping the liner angles and pressing it up against the side this will easily give you the thinnest line imaginable for the outer corner wing it out by outlining first and then fill it in with a gold cream pigment apply a tiny amount using the small detailed brush on the inner corners and bottom lower lash line from there just blended together by using the same color to illuminate your upper lid i'm going to use this nifty product from Korea it's a dual ended stick to give yourself puffy eyes or a go sell in Korean literally means charming skin first step a few millimeters under your natural lower lash line draw a line with the top grin from there flip the pen over and use the shimmering white side carefully . between the line and just true it's kind of crazy what a little bit of taupe and shimmer can do as if you need to make your eyes any bigger but if you want to give her lashes a good curl and apply generous coats of mascara i chose one that has long bristles so that I could literally comb through my lashes to separate them if your brows are needing to be tamed use a brow gel to sculpt them in shape this tiny one here is by benefit and it's perfect for travel and it has fibers in it to give the appearance of actual brow hairs moving on using a light pearlescent cream shadow added to the inner part of your upper cheek bones for that highlight action this will make your cheeks appear fuller and we'll give you a more youthful appearance now it's time for the lips to prep them and prevent any lipstick from leading outline them with a lip liner similar to your lip color and with your favorite peachy nude lipstick apply this on your lips patting it on with your finger to get rid of any excess residue if a peach nude is too basic for you go crazy with the new bold lip color this liquid lipstick from jeffree star is super fun and hydrating formula stays put all day just make sure to carefully apply in little strokes and don't forget the sides of your mouth and in between your lips it doesn't matter what lip or makeup you decide to go with just make sure to wear it confidently because makeup is an expression of one of your many side express confidently and of course good luck yeah yeah yeah you I always believed that we as people are multifaceted beings there's a part of me that loves darkness I feel like I can hide in the shadows and disappear like a mystery I know it's cheesy but this is my alter ego you want to start off by pulling your hair back and using a cleansing wipe to get rid of any excess makeup dirt and oil on your face we want to start with a clean canvas as the temperature gets colder your skin's natural layer of moisture tends to dry out you can get rid of any flaky dry patches by using a microdermabrasion skin exfoliant warm it up in your hands and want the product onto your skin using a circular motion and once you're done just rinse it off your skin should look and feel polish after us Foley eight try to moisturize your skin or else it's gonna feel really dry and stiff you want to find a hydrating moisture mask to soothe your skin and now that your face is hydrated do the same on your lips coconut is a natural humectant which means it will help draw moisture in and keep your lips a little longer coconut is life all right moving on start taking those brows using a quality slanted tweezer try not to go overboard because you want your brows to stay full and natural-looking allow for some time before going out because there might be redness from the plucking using a cream highlighter apply this to the tops of your cheekbones you want to do this under your base to give your skin a natural do we look if you want to look younger a dewy complexion will help get you there one of my top three favorite cushion compact is by I obey this compact is called the six-second compact as they say one is sold every six seconds I wasn't paid to say that true fact the cushion applicator provides a light feathery coverage that will cling to any imperfections you don't really need to cover your entire face just patri your face until redness and blemishes or less noticeable all right now it's time to break out your favorite concealer so i've been using this cushion concealer and at first I didn't think i would like it but now I kind of use it for everything concealing and highlighting for this one you can use it under your eyes as well as other dark spots on your face such as blemishes and the areas around your nose and mouth so just blend out your concealer until it looks natural now it's time to set your face by stippling once and press powder I have right here this doll 10cc powder it's pretty unique because it has green and pink be even any imperfections and discolorations on the skin what's nice about it is that it doesn't have a Kiki finish before you buy any powder read reviews or test it out to make sure it's not chalky the powder should look and feel silky and refined find a dark cream eye color like a deep tongue or burgundy and warming up between your fingers when I only have five minutes to do a smokey eye this is my go-to method apply a dark cream eyeshadow or eyeliner directly on your eyelid lightly with your ring finger if you want more precision use your pinky finger keep dabbing to blend the shadow the murray blend the smokier and softer it look so now with your favorite pencil liner and using the back of a tweezer to hold the island in place create small strokes like this along your waterline personally I think this is the easiest way to apply eyeliner it's pretty much full proof and provides a nice smoky effect for more precision you can take a stiff angled brush to create that wing see you'll be a master at the smoky eye in no time tight lining is when you apply liner into the rim of your upper and lower lash line it feels kind of weird at first and your eyes might water but you kind of get used to it oh the things we do for beauty use a black felt-tip eyeliner to punctuate the shape and intensity of the wing perfect on my lazy days which I have a lot of i skip eyelash curling however it's useful for opening up your eyes unless you have naturally curly eyelashes and lucky when applying mascara to your upper lashes look down when applying it to the bottom look up or straight that way your body's natural reflex doesn't freak out when it sees this stick poking near your eye moving on to the brows using the taupe eyebrow pencil create feathery strokes to imitate little brow hairs using an angled eyeliner brush add fullness to the browse by flipping them out when your boo is complaining that you're taking way too long to do your makeup tell him next time browse over those when both eyes have the perfect lines use the wings as a guide to add more dimension to your crease with a small eyeshadow brush and using the same cream eyeliner intensify the depth of your eyes ok let's take a break from the eyes and move on to the cheeks find a dark brown hair that's three to four shades darker than your skin color to carve out your cheekbones with a fluffy angled brush to keep your contour as natural looking as possible use a light hand and try not to get too close to your mouth add bronzer along your temples to accentuate your face all right back to the eyes find a glittery eyeshadow in with your pinky because it's super tiny pop this shimmery eyeshadow along the inner third of your eyelid blending with your ring finger this will help bring more magic to your eyes by now my lips are nice and soft thanks to the coconut bomb and it's ready to be painted black before I apply any color make sure there's not a product left on the lips you want to remove any lingering concealer or foundation with a wipe giving yourself a clean canvas to work with ok now the moment of truth break out the darkest lip color you have start with the biggest areas on your lips around the center of the bottom and top lip it's kind of like painting within the lines so start with the largest areas first from there carefully apply the lipstick to the outline of your lips and it's totally fine if it's not perfect because we're going to clean it up later if you want more precision use a smaller brush to adjust the lines for a cleaner shape very nice all right moving on to hear if you're not using argan oil in your hair you're missing out all the nutrients lost during coloring treatments and heat styling can be restored if you use oils like argan oil the Royal Egyptians were young to have beautiful silky hair thanks to oil what you want to do is warm up the oil between your hands and finger comb through your hair for that silky finish and now it's time to transform into my alter ego there's a lot of beautiful temporary tattoos that you can find online or on etsy find your favorite design that speaks to you if you don't know exactly where an important part of the design is going to be placed what I like to do is cut a notch in the paper before I apply here I cut out a little notch in the middle of the neck application so I know exactly where to Center it and once you have it on and it's nice and centered had lightly with a water-soaked paper towel or sponge try to make sure that it thoroughly wet if you want to check to see if it transferred peel back one side slightly and if the tattoo is revealed you can safely peel the whole thing off from here just add more tattoos where you see fit tell your own story through these tattoos the art and design should inspire you don't worry they're only temporary so you can experiment as many times as you want with zero commitment now my alter ego look is complete if you're going to recreate your alter ego look make sure to tag me in all your pictures so that I can see now and like them mmm i love you dreamers good luck yeah yeah yeah yeah so i'm really loving taylor swift's me look and in this video i'm gonna show you how to recreate it majority of the products that i'm using in this video are from december's ipsy glam bag but if you don't have one no worries because i'm going to describe the colors as best as i can and you guys can use any products that you have that are similar at your disposal first thing first primary eyes primer is not only great to help saturate color but it also helps prevent smudging all right let's recreate Taylor's famous eyeliner look using Urban Decay's 24-7 black liner I'm going to load it on my brush first the reason why I'm using a flat edge eyeliner brush is because sometimes the tip of the eyeliner pencil can be a little too blunt so what i'm doing here is i'm just flicking the brush ever so slightly to create an illusion of twinkling looking eyes like Taylor's notice how the cotton swab has a point your end cosmetic grey cotton swabs are seriously a must have for all you make up levers ok so finish line in your eyes and let's move on to making your eyes sparkle try and find a champagne loose eyeshadow color of your trace the 1 i'm using here is mixed ultra pearl mania eyeshadow pigments tend to have a stronger payout than regular eye shadows because the intensity is stronger uses as highlighter for your eyes to help brighten them up ok so depending on how much I laid space you have I prefer calling it eyelid real estate what i'm doing here is bringing my eyeliner up a few millimeters below my crease line so here's the thing this smaller and thinner your eyeliner is the bigger your eyes will look because you're showing your lips space be careful not to make your eyeliner shape too big or else you can look like an anime character now it's time to curl your lashes to get them nice and perky what you're going to do is apply mascara on your upper and lower lash line we move the eyes are done moving on to foundation before you do anything prime your face i'm using the same Mirabella one that I used on my eyes yeah take your foundation and if you want to match Taylor skin color she has a very fair complexion so I'm just going to go a few shades lighter than my own skin color blend away with a cosmetic sponge dipped in white cream add this to your cheeks nose bridge and chin to highlight this area and it's time to bleach my hair so i can turn it blonde this is honestly the worst week I've ever use sadly i ordered it online and I didn't try it out before the tutorials so i had to make do because all the workshops were closed as long as you guys get the picture a fake lashes for that extra glam and if your eyes are blue like Taylor's use blue contacts to match your icon time to contour your nose and cheekbones i'm using a matte taupe color you want to make sure that it's matt and don't use any shimmery bronzer or won't look as natural time to highlight the face i'm using my Couture is highlighting the sheets I'm just gonna tear one sheet out and highlight my cheekbones to recreate Taylor's glowing skin and of course you have to finish off with her signature red lip color I'm going to line my lips like so and sculpt them in to match her lip shape you want to use concealer around the lips to create a very precise lip shape time for the last step just finish off with the red

finally here my favorite part about summer is hanging out with my friends and finding ways to capture more memories which means i gotta make sure your look at gunpoint so i'm going to show you how to achieve that glow doing skin that will last sweats & Son start off with the cleansing wipe and clear off every trace of leftover makeup dirt and oil prep the skin with a cooling cucumber facial mask the cucumber works to combat readiness by soothing this area just wait 10 minutes and then clean up your face so i've been using here this nifty new skincare product from Korea it's called a cool poor stick that provides a thin layer of moisture that combats dry spots and the best part it doesn't leave behind a sticky texture now that your skin is prepped you're ready to move on to make up begin with an oil-free primer and apply this along any area of the face that tends to get shiny if you have large pores or fine lines this will soften and reduce the appearance i love using a brush whenever i'm applying primer because it really gets into all the nooks and crannies moving on to foundation I like to cocktail a few products so I'm mixing in a dewy formula with my favorite long-wear BB cream that has a built-in sunscreen this gives me buildable coverage with a subtle globe i'm all about that glow for your under-eye gently . a light concealer and softly to fuse with your ring finger now that you've perfected your skin beat your face with a soft translucent powder to keep everything in place next add some dimension to your face while warming up your skin with a matte bronzer bronzer outline of her face like around the temples cheekbones and under the jaw line try and keep your application light and let your radiant skin shine through you should look sunkissed not Burt cool so moving on to rise prep your lids with a flesh tone base because the skin around the eye area is so thin blood vessels might show through but a flesh tone base or concealer will help reduce the appearance and now that your eyes are primed get a neutral palette that you're crushing on this one's pretty legit all right go in with a tan colored shadow and use this as a wash on your lids to warm up your eyes yeah next color up should be am at smoky color add this deep shade all along your upper and lower lash line and blend it out we want a nice hazy smoldering look to make sure to blend blend blend it should be a subtle gradient here's a fun tip try and use another clean fluffy brush to haze out the color to maintain dimensionalize take a light nude eyeshadow and pop this color under your brows along the brow bone and continue blending time for some shimmer and sparkles find a sparkling peach tone color and paint this along the inner corner of your eyes to highlight this area using a metallic copper color add this along the top of your eyelids and softly blend out highlighting key areas on the eyes will help make them stand out more if your brows are sparse like mine here find a tough shadow for your brows and color them in with a brush for a more natural look I like to top it off with a brow pencil by feathering in the illusion of brow hairs so try and find a double-ended brow pencil that has both the pencil and the spoolie I know once my browser set I feel so much more confident in my face feels complete oh my dear brow pencil you complete me why use a black eyeliner when there are so many colors to choose from summertime should inspire you to try a new eyeliner color just be bold try a deep teal eye liner and line your eyes as close to the lash line as possible and pops them along the waterline to intensify the eyes you don't have to draw a perfect line in one take especially if you have shaky hands instead you can actually build up the line until you have a flawless shape i know i said to experiment with more color for your eyeliner but if you prefer to stick with your trusty old black liner try a gel baseliner instead this works better during the summertime because one its water resistant into it's easier to apply try to experiment with different eyeliner brushes until you find the right one you feel confident with all you have to do now is curl the lashes as used and apply several coats of mascara and through your lashes feel fat and juicy yeah bring in the light with a highlighter makes your highlighter with a bit of bronzer for that summer glow and touch this across your cheek bones use a warm highlighter and with a smaller brush dab the highlighter along the high points on your face for that dewy finish if you want a

eye patches or chamomile tea bags leave them on for a few minutes and remove say bye to your puffiness your skin is going to feel super refreshed time to prep your makeup so just stipple on a primer to help smooth out your skin try to focus around the t-zone area because this is where you're going to see a lot of shine keep puffing in whatever is left on the brush and let's move on to brightening up that I area using a small brush apply concealer gently around your eye area try to be gentle around this area because the skin around the eyes is very delicate use any excess product even out dark spots in any blemishes on the skin I tend to have a lot of redness around my nose engine area so I like to pack on a little more concealer around here majority of your skin problem is not what you put on your skin but what you put in your body and how stressed out you are so try your best eat healthy and relax the more you're stressed out the more your skin will show it try using blotting papers to control oil this is by far my favorite blotting paper brand apparently it's from japan in geishas use this to touch up your makeup press them on anywhere to minimize shine and lightly go over them with powder to enhance the effect doing this helps keep your powder from looking too cakey also if your boyfriend is not into makeup what you want to tone down that shyness and pictures try using this instead of powder trust me on this one depending on your skin type if you have oily skin use a powder highlighter if you have dry skin use a liquid or cream highlighter highlight your cheeks and take whatever is left on the brush down your neck and across your shoulders this will give you that beautiful shimmery glow keep your brows natural by lightly filling them in and defining their shape with a pencil eyebrows are very personal and will change as you grow so keep experimenting once you have a shape you like run the spoolie over your brows to blend the pencil out this will give it a more natural finish just keep the hairs in place by sweeping them up and out for the eyes we're giving them a sweet pastel pop of color take a nude pink and Pat this all over your lower lash line and lid this will bring a more romantic mood to your eyes now you can take a pastel blue color and pass this along your upper lash line bringing the color out blend out the eye area with a fluffy brush to give your eyes a subtle wash of color try and keep it light for the liner take an icy blue pencil and place it around the inner corners to open up your eyes keep lining up words along the inner half of your lid and into the crease like this to touch right under your brow bone and blend out to highlight this area and to finish off just set the cream pencil with an iridescent white eyeshadow now if you want to make your eyes stand out even more take a dark eyeliner pencil and tight line your upper and lower waterline everyone has their favorite way to line their eyes I prefer doing it with a brush so with an angled liner brush when it over the pencil and then stay as close to the lash line as possible sweep the brush out to create a double wing and don't forget to line along your lower lash line as well to help balance out your eyes from here just curl your lashes and apply a few coats of volumizing mascara for that finishing touch with neutral tone contrast stick to find the shape of your nose blending as you go with a small fluffy brush this will give you that cute button nose effect add dimension to your face by applying some bronzer to scope out your face and apply blush to add color to your cheeks or lips line them the nude pink color and fill them in taking a baby pink matte lip cream place it in the center of your lips and blend it out with a fluffy eyeshadow brush to keep the color from bleeding as you can see you have baby dollops clean up the edges of your lips with a little bit of concealer on a flat synthetic brush perfect ok so moving on to hear i'm using this rainbow barrel curling iron to create loose tousled waves seriously this is the prettiest curling are never right you want them to look natural and undone so wrap the hair around the barrel wait a few seconds and release ok for nails find a bright vibrant pink or baby blue nail polish to match the spring colors finish off with perfume that smells like a fresh spring day personally I love

cream shadow pass these on to your eyelid and use a precise i brush to bring it down along the lower lash line moving on starting at the middle of your I take a black gel liner and wing it out towards

if you want me to find them use hashtag look mesh alright jammers be safe people & be fearless good luck yeah yeah yeah hi dreamers I wanted to create a beauty look inspired by my aura photograph each and every one of us has energy pulsing through our bodies and using state-of-the-art technology we can actually see the electromagnetic waves we radiate from within these waves are translated into colors so I invited a team of experienced or photographers to come into the studio for a reading this machine was able to capture my inner light each color corresponds with the mood in treat how you feel on the inside reflects on the outside you might not be able to see the light but those who are sensitive can sense it I guess you can say this is kind of like an inner selfie after seeing my own aura I was inspired to create this dreamy look that will make it look as if you're glowing from within all right let your inner beauty shine through by starting with a clean face i'm using here this soy milk cleanser to keep my skin supple and smooth put some on your hands and spread it all over your face massage your face as you go and rinse optically alright so moving on to a mat poor reducing primer evenly apply this product using a stippling brush onto the lips you can add a touch of a moisturizing lipstick with a hint of tint this will enhance your natural lip color giving your lips and nice flushed look there is definitely beauty in simplicity time for foundation take a few pumps on the back of her hand and load some onto your stippling brush the goal is to avoid covering your entire face you just want to even out your skin's natural texture and color focus on the areas around your nose lips and eyes for a bit of coverage around your eyes use a creamy concealer to conceal your dark circles try finding a hydrating concealer because you're under eyes tend to be a little bit more dry than the rest of your face take a little extra and tap it on as eyeshadow base remember to be gentle with the delicate skin around your eyes don't ugh it's totally normal if your lip shape is not even if you want to reshape them take a little more concealer on a small synthetic brush and line your lips to even out the shape afterwards just be sure to blend out with a sponge whatever you have left over just even out your eyes and blend that out as well ok now you can take a nude highlighter and accentuate areas of your face wherever the light naturally hits your face accentuate that area you can apply along your brow bones inner corners of your eyes a little on your nose cheeks and keep its bow here's a fun tip drawing small crosses on your cheeks will help highlight without looking too harsh and with a brush slightly blend out the highlighter light will reflect wherever you apply this highlighter this will give you that in chanting glow as for your eyes take a sheer creamy eye shadow and Pat it all over your lids for a wash of color try finding a beautiful lie light color and if you want to go for a more air deficit look on your eyes as if light is coming from within take a frosty white shadow to brighten your inner corners and bring this glow all the way up to your crease framing the inner half of your eye place any leftover product on your brow bone and tap it along the lower lash line this will give your eyes a halo effect on to eyeliner we don't want this look to appear too harsh so just tight line your eyes by lifting up your lashes quickly and gently gliding the pencil along the upper waterline if your eyes get watery it's totally normal once you tightly under eyes add some of this pencil eyeliner on an angled brush and wing it along the upper lashes let's give some love to your lashes find a mascara with a tiny one this one is perfect for getting extra close to the roots of your lashes creating a tight lining effect so come thru your favorite mascara that has a natural finish you want to make sure to keep your brows looking natural for this look so use a pencil or powder to fill them in enhance the shape but don't overdo it brush the hairs into place and blend out the color if your browser appear drawn on try using feathery strokes this will give them a more natural finish all right take your favorite highlighting powder and we're basically going to cheat that glow from within use a tapered brush highlight on the areas on your cheats where light is naturally hitting it and whatever is left over on your brush just tap a little on your forehead unless you already have a nice curved forehead I'd skip this step continue building up your highlights until you've reached the glow you're satisfied with using your index or ring finger . some product under your eyes to punctuate the halo effect and if you want you can even highlight your collar bones so that the light can reflect off of them and if you're looking to give your lips that aura like low use a lip liner that slightly deeper than your natural lip color line your lips and blend it out just keep repeating until you're happy with the shade and shape of your lips to soften the look of your lips take a soft pastel lipstick that compliments your skin tone and place it all over now with a frosty shadow from before Pat it on the center of your lips finish it off by adding a nice tinted oil that will add extra moisture and shine don't look like the hair it needs to be shiny - I'm a huge believer in using hair oil take a dime sized amount of argan oil in the palm of her hands and rub them together to warm up the product and from there just run your fingers through your hair focusing on your ends keep finger coming until your hair feel soft and you see that shine all right and now you can style your hair I'm going to keep it simple and use my trusty old hair clip that super 90 is looking click the sides of your hair back and take a few front pieces to frame your face and now my dear you're done go out there and let your beautiful or shine through I believe that Souls recognize each other by vybz not by appearances so put out good positive energy and thoughts good vibes only please if you happen to have your or photograph taken tag me and use the hashtag in her selfie until next time good luck trimmers yeah yeah hi beautiful a lot of you have been asking me to create more hair fashion nail and makeup tutorials so an idea popped in my head inspired by sailing captain planet these gorgeous ladies here including myself are combining our forces to create this multifaceted tutorial cosmic candy ok let's start with Jesse if you're getting bored of your plain black t-shirt or short look no further than the stars for inspiration you'll need a few sponges brushes glitter spray pastel fabric paints and a spray bottle filled with water what your sponge and loaded up with the lavender shade start tapping the paint onto the shorts when you're painting anything Galaxy inspired it's all about creating depth with these colors make sure to blend out any harsh edges now that you have the base done it's time to layer more colors to give your shorts more dimension take a light neutral shade like a white or silver and use this as a highlighter wherever it feels two dimensional highlight continue adding depth using mid tone colors like magenta and teal and you can add that cosmic touch I carefully flicking white paint from a small brush look you just created stars pretty be one with the galaxy shorts blend out the edges as needed and repeat these steps to continue layering for your desired look and if you feel like you're at a good place use your small brush again for the finishing touches it's all about the details here you can create starburst planets whatever for that extra effect spray a little bit of that silver or white color thus creating a sprinkle of star clusters yeah yeah moving onto Kristin if you want to recreate her out of this world now look you need to make up brushes these are denser than regular arts punches and will ensure even application to start take a protective base coat and layer this on your nails now you can coat and iridescent white polish on top of the base coat depending on your polish formula you only need one to two coats now just top it off with a light pastel pink color because you have several layers of paint on your nails you're in this awkward stage where you can't really do anything that requires serious hand movements so i can watch your favorite show read a book or go online basically kill time at least 10 minutes for your nails to dry completely no one is perfect that's why nail polish remover was invented so load up an old eyeliner brush with nail polish remover and clean up any smudges perfect colors you will need are a magenta purple shade a vibrant pink and a powder blue and if you want a more subtle look focus on creating a statement nail instead of painting all of them you can paint directly on the sponge combining all the colors and press this onto your nail you want to use this time to experiment so unleash your inner Monet using the pointed edge of a cuticle stick a toothpick paper clip basically anything pointing make little crosses and dots to recreate the stars all right from here just top off your nails with glitter now it's time to dry that means time to veg out and be a princess because you can't do anything with wet nails once you're in the clear add a clear glossy top coat and you're done so pretty sailor moon would dig this krispies hair color will change depending on the mood now she's going to show you how to give your hair that galactic edge using hair chalk first thing first make sure you're wearing a shirt that you're not going to miss because talking is messy the night before prep your hair with a leave-in conditioner because chalk is drying to begin take a small section of hair focusing on the ends place it between the makeup sponge and blue hair truck press lightly and pull through to get the best color payoff repeat this step using a green color applying it above the blue for a gradient effect and after you've done a third of your hair spray it with hairspray to set it before the color can transfer or shake off repeat these steps until all your ends have been chopped and set once you're done show and tell take a selfie aunt Agatha's moving on to Katie she's here with a space-age lip look just be sure your lips are clean and prepped take a nude cream lipstick and load this color on your lips this will neutralize your natural lip tone helping the colors stand out using a fluffy brush apply a white iridescent loose pigment all over your lips now with a purple pigment brush this color along the inner corner of your mouth keeping the color as you go do the same with a teal shade placing it along the outer inner corner using a pearly blue color blend out the edges of the teal shadow onto your Cupid's bow and lower lip and with a bright magenta color do the same to the purple color and to bridge everything together use a rose gold color on your lower lip and blend if you want to accentuate fullness with an iridescent white pigment passed this along the center of your lower lip to complete your look gorgeous a unicorn would approve eyes inspired by the bright colors of space start applying an iridescent vanilla color on your lids as a base using a baby blue shadow with your shadow brush place this color directly on your crease and blend back and forth find a map in color and apply the shadow right on the empty spot focusing on the inner half of your I ready to make your eyes sparkle literally find a glitter liner that has a purple undertone and draw a line as close to the lash line as possible winging it out towards the end with the creamy white eyeliner apply this along the lower waterline an inner corner for highlighting effect for that bold accent use an electric blue liner and line your lower lashline gently applying along the lower water line as well you want to be sure to stay towards the outer corner of the eye slightly blending it into the white eye pencil give your lashes a good girl from root to tip because what we really want to do is make this electric blue mascara stand out on your beautifully curled lashes sweep a generous amount of mascara on the top and bottom lashes if you're highlighting freak like myself highlight your inner corner with a little more glitter and with your white eyeliner highlight your brow bone and blend out with a brush finished your cosmic candy-inspired eyes are done all right everyone thank you so much for watching I hope you are inspired by all these fantastic looks created by these gorgeous ladies don't forget to show them some love nah let me know which look you're going to try out tag me online so that perhaps I can spot light your work love you forever dreamers good luck in your eyes and I license yeah Union koala hi gorgeous I have here a beautiful look for you to try out to ring in the lunar new year it's the year of the goat or sheep a year of promise and prosperity before we begin we need to have a fresh clean face so take a cleansing wipe and gently prep the delicate area under your eyes making sure that your face is completely clean we need our skin to be free of any oil and dirt and if my under eyes are feeling puffy I'll use the treatment like this to help perk them up it's kind of like a cup of coffee for the eyes yep thank the internet for my late nights let it sit for a few minutes and then just wipe it off with a white clean tissue ok now that my eyes are awake one last step before moving on to makeup is priming the skin find one with a built-in moisturizer a primer helps create a smoother skin surface minimizing pores and fine lines however if you're a teenager you can skip primer you don't need this stuff so to supply this baby all over your face or just spot treat on any problem areas like an oily t-zone now you can take a nap of concealer and gently apply under your eyes you want to be extra gentle because this area is very delicate all right if you're looking more alive than you are good so we can now move on to our favorite foundation or BB cream for a while I've been substituting my foundation with a cushion compact like this one this was a gift from korea from something that instead of using your hands or brush cushion compact has a very specific application with the cushion sponge provided dab it on the sponge soaked in BB or CC cream and very lightly dab on your face like foundation BB or CC cream from Korea is very different than BB and CC cream from the West the coverage is light to medium in the finish is Dewey so i recommend trying different formulations before settling with your Holy Grail so continue dabbing the cushion sponge all over your face until you even out your complexion when I know how to cheat a flawless complexion use a lightweight highlighter there are two parts to healthy looking skin complexion and luminosity a highlighter can help punctuated this by giving you that boost the key less is more you need just a little small dabs here and there on the high points of your cheeks and forehead and tip of the nose and Cupid's bow ready to blush with a shimmering peach blush loaded up with your brush and locating your cheekbones lightly dust the brush all over this area building up the color for this look you don't want to look as if you're wearing blush it should look as if you're really blushing all right it's time to move on to the eyebrows if you have sparse brows like myself here use a matte powder that's a few shades darker than your own hair color and lightly fill in your brows if you need more definition use a

applicator and blender and use this color along the outer third of your eyes to create the illusion of depth and shadow load a little bit of the camel color on your blender brush and buff the color along the outer third again to create a hazy look follow the natural contours on your eyes you'll notice right away how big they're gonna look find a mas color with a pearl finish and add this color along the outer lash line this is going to help wide in the shape of your eyes giving them a sexy look and just top off your eye makeup with a metallic gray denim color and you can use your clean ring finger for this part just Pat it on the center of the lids and use your brush to feather it out for smoldering finish if you have a dark brown eyeliner colored use this under the lower lash line and outer upper lash line this will help accentuate the shape of your beautiful eyes if you already have curly lashes just skip this step but if you don't use a lash curler to perk up the lashes this

length you're happy with because we're going to use a lip liner prep your lips first with a lip balm and i'm just going to use a very light layer of my pillow plush and berries for the cheeks you can either contour for that supermodel circulated cheekbones or use a multi blush for a light touch of color on the cheeks trying to avoid pink and peach it's not going to work with this color palette add this on the cheekbones and blend with your fingers another way to apply is too low the color directly on your fingers first quickly padding the cheek area for that blushing finish with the dark red or plan what color outline your lips first this will prevent your lip color from feather and then just fill in your lips to help boost the longevity of your lip color very nice onto the lip color find a dark plum or oxblood lip color and paint this rich color on the lips try and use a brush especially when you're working with a dark color so that you can have an even application and for my nails I decided to wear a dark red wine color who would have guessed they now make hair CC cream crazy so use your favorite styling cream and warm it up between your fingers breasts before running them through the hair for that texture bedhead finish looking good and if you want that finishing touch just enhance your scent with a light fragrance and this is why i love rollerball fragrances because a

with a cc or BB cream and lightly Pat this over your entire face with your clean hands the stream you can also use a foundation or stippling brush or sponge concealer should be used sparingly remember a little goes a long way all you really need is one swipe under the eyes down the bridge of your nose for highlighter around the sides of the nose and mouth to cover up any redness and all blemishes try using your fingers to apply this warms up the product and makes the application smoother and easier blend away for a flawless finish as of lately I've been using to brow pencils to fill in my brows if you ever look closely at your brows you might notice that towards the inner corners they're more sparse and towards the end there more full your brows don't have to match your hair color you should either be darker or lighter depending on the look you're going for on the ice start with a matte cream base to even out the color of your lids next apply a shimmering lavender color along the crease of your eye and blend away this will give your eyes a tin chanting mood through the canyon the next step take a light pink eyeshadow and apply this all over the lids and blend up into the crease you wanted to look as light and airy as possible add more dimension to your eyes with highlighter lift up the eyes with a hint of shimmer along the inner corner of your eyes and brow bone to open up your eyes for that summary look use a sunshine yellow eyeliner on the bottom waterline notice how much brighter the eyes look your eyes will definitely stand out in pictures to really give this look a bowl pop use a vibrant blue or teal color to line the top and bottom lash line i'm going to start with the lower lash line first keeping the line thin now just lie in the upper lashline staying as close to the lash line as possible to intensify the eye makeup and extend out to form a cat eye gently soften the edges with a clean brush this will give your eye makeup that theory look and if you're looking for a more subtle look just switch out the blue liner for something more delicate and natural like a navy or dark brown almost done with the eye makeup we just need a few swipes of your trusty little mascara for perky lashes finish off your summer look with a beautiful baby pink lipstick keep your lip color natural because this look is all about your eyes as much there's no ax to bold or too simple that's not worth your self expression i challenge you to explore and test your boundaries play with color patterns and styles and looks I believe there's an artist and everyone so let's find the artist within you break out your pencil and paper because i'm going to show you how to draw a beautiful face with the light hand start out with the circle the most fundamental shape doesn't have to be perfect from here draw across and split the circle in half follow the horizontal corners of the cross and create a triangle shape this marks the chin area and on the horizontal line of the cross marks where the I should be in the ears should line up to the eyes the nose will sit around the bottom of the circle and the lips will be within this area so take this time to flesh out the face shape you can create cute chubby cheeks supermodel sunken cheekbones or whatever draw what makes you feel better and once you have a general idea start erasing the guidelines to reveal your face shape everyone has a signature way to draw nigh so take this time to play around with different shapes for a basic almond-shaped I draw a curve and draw the bottom lashline feather out some lashes to open up the eyes and draw a rectangle shape to create a reflection in the eye and repeat the same step for the other hand and after your eyes are drawn it's time to erase the guidelines take this time to add in the details for the eyes just two simple marks for the nostril and a line for the nose bridge as for the lips keep the lines curvy and soft so here's where the beauty techniques help Heather at the lines to create subtle brow hairs as if you're really filling in your brows as for the hair start with the hairline and work your way out to create the full hair shape touch up the makeup if needed and if you want to play up your fashion or jewelry designing side draw your own designs on her ear and neck have fun with it and remember you can erase

exfoliating your skin twice a week if you have normal to dry skin three times a week if you have oily skin and if exfoliating is too harsh on your sensitive skin try using a gentle makeup cleanser instead try and avoid any products with harsh chemicals so that it doesn't irritate your skin find one that has natural ingredients and once you're all skincare it up and you want to boost your makeups longevity use a mattifying face primer apply this product on any oily spots on your face like your nose and forehead really work the product onto your skin because you're creating a barrier between your skincare and makeup and once you're all primed up let's get started with face makeup using your favorite foundation BB or CC cream and with your clean fingers brush or my current fav Christian cream sponge apply your product evenly on your face and back to blend out to create a smooth even finish perhaps in the future dark circles will be a thing in the past but for now concealer

city smokies palette or just find any silver smoky eyeshadow palette apply a shimmering pale peach color on your legs the trick to using silver eyeshadow is to make sure your base is warm silver can

and natural skin texture on your face this will help create an airbrush finish make sure everything is blended away and let's move on to the next step powdering your face if you want to maintain the longevity of your face makeup use a matte powder try not to use powder all over your face just along the areas under the eyes around the nose chin forehead to reduce shininess dab away and set the powder concentrating under the eyes and on the t-zone once you're done with foundation and powder let's move on to your brows perfectly arched dark brow helps to find this look if you really want to

for your brows you might be surprised by how much it can change up your look and now that you have the perfect base in canvas it's time for the fun part adding color and definition i'm using here this nice matte multiple it's perfect for a matte look you want to use a product that has a strong color payoff so that you just need a little bit less is more another way to use matte multiple is too wet your hands first and then touch the multiple and start applying the product on your face and just passed this on your cheeks for that second skin finish your contour shade should always be Matt shininess draws more attention to features and makes them more prominent while darker matte shades creates more depth and once you've laid out your color blend away to shear perfection I'm all about multifunctional tools so the more ways you can use a product better if you want a more bronze kiss look use this along your forehead for that summer look just keep lending away and let's move on on the eyes Matt of shadow is all you need this is an essential must have color for your eyes especially if you need to contour your eyes add this along the hollows of your eyes to create more depth my sig and using a dark brown color line your eyes upper and lower to create the illusion of bigger looking eyes pop of color like pink is perfect for the cheeks even though the product is matt still brings life in dimension back to your face rosy pink cheeks are perfect for spring look to add this on the high points on your face all right you know this step curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for mascara once your lashes are curled apply a volumizing mascara that you can build up with several codes from there finish up your lips with a rosy pink matte color to soften your look if you want balance you need to have the opposite so i'm using here a metallic rose gold eyeliner on my waterline to help right in my eyes just because we're creating a matte look doesn't mean everything has to have a matte finish I'm all for shiny hair once it starts looking Gracie we should fix this that's why a dry shampoo is a must have for me if you want to stay on trend find a bright pastel nail color shiny or not using a mattifying top coat will instantly modify your nails or you can you Steve - have fun trying this new spring trends that make up that hair and nails don't be scared to experiment you never know what you'll discover have fun and good luck yeah a selfie is like a self-portrait you want to capture the best version of yourself right and after that there are so many filters you can choose to help enhance your picture well in this video I'm going to show you how to enhance your skin without the need of a filter let's start with basic skin care step one cleanser use a cleanser that works for your skin type is it tries boilie normal or a combination like myself real of them if you have a dry skin type use the cream cleanser and if it's oily use a gel cleanser and if you're looking to exfoliate your skin wash your face with a washcloth to gently scrub away to reveal perfectly polished skin feels gonna step number two you I cream and you really just need a pea sized amount use your ring fingers and start patting it on like this your ring finger is the most delicate finger try not to stretch or tug this area around just softly have the product around your eye area step number three skin serum a sara is very concentrated two pumps is all you need to do and apply this all over your face and neck think of a ceremony like a supercharged booster for your skin care routine some are made to help reduce aging and at me others can brighten and repair the skin step number four moisturizer or lotion a dime sized amount is all you need and apply this all over your face and neck after washing your face that healthy sebum layer is gone so by using moisturizer you're recreating that barrier to keep hydration locked in a lot of moisturizers can prevent water loss next step lip balm i'm assuming most of you are already using a lip balm if not find a lip balm that works well for you no different from using a moisturizer on your skin lip balm will help keep your lips from drying out locking moisture in no makeup all skincare get your foundation and blush ready i'm using here my love me for me foundation in shell number nine and then with my rounded foundation brush start applying the foundation around the center of your face and forehead first cover up any redness and even out your skin after foundation if you need to cover up any spots or dark areas use concealer most people have dark circles so it's not a big deal with people see you with them but then again i know people who look better with their dark circles kind of like a vampire but if you look more like a zombie try to reduce them by lightly concealing them it's not about erasing them it's about lightening up the dark area will make a huge difference see before we finish the face makeup you have to seal everything in with powder you can either use translucent powder or a powder that has coverage like the one I'm using here like foundation start around the center of your face and move out so that in photos of filter won't be needed to perfect my skin and right now if you purchase ends love me for me powder compact you get a matching foundation for free all right let's get back to this tutorial for my brows if i'm looking for a softer look I prefer using a brow powder or an eyeshadow that matches your brow color you want to make sure you're using an angled eyeliner brush to give you better precision when you're creating your brow shape I like to draw a line on the bottom of my brows first so that I can see what my brows will look like before filling them in and from there just make little strokes to create the illusion of brow hairs and lightly brush with a spoolie to soften your browse ok we all know this step curling the lashes my lashes are not curly and they grow straight down so i personally have to curl my lashes to lift them up however if you have naturally curly lashes well aren't you lucky ducky use the lash lengthening mascara because we want long clean looking lashes alright final step taking care of your hair I color my hair a lot lately i've been using leaving conditioner and hair oils to replenish my her yeah so we're done no filter needed good skin care and foundation never hurts but a smile is all you need good luck we like hey the script yeah yeah you know there are days when you just can't get her hair to look right but then we have those days when we look and feel like the Queen because I want my skin to look flawless i'm going to be using face primer first I actually recommend this product for guys who want to reduce shiny face without the makeup look smooth this all over your face and let's move on to concealing take your favorite concealer i'm using here my trusty old great cover up concealer and with my Beauty Blender sponge I have right here i'm going to show you my current face makeup routine with a little bit of concealer on the sponge I'm dabbing a Touch under my eyes to brighten and conceal any of the dark areas and sometimes what I'll do is add a lighter concealer shade around my cheek area to create the illusion of fuller looking cheeks so just smooth everything out and powder up you can either use a sponge a powder brush or a powder puff to gently apply the powder on the area where you used concealer or foundation if your foundation or concealer has a matte finish you can skip this step all right time for the brows i'm going to be using two pencils and a brow filler to create my brow look for today I'm taking my brow pencils here called arch and using a color that matches my draw hair I'm going to fill in my brows if you naturally have full brows you might not need much work however for me I have to literally draw my brows on by creating feathery strokes once you're done creating your brow shape an extra step I like to do is add a brow filler brush this over your brows and you'll notice right away how natural they look find an eyeliner or eyeshadow in an amethyst color and outline the outer third of your eyes what you want to do is create a wing shape just by following your natural contour and from here just fill in the line is if you're coloring in a leaf you want to make sure to leave the center of your lids empty and from here with the brush quickly smudge the color to create a soft gradation you can use a blending brush if you need it using here a teal or turquoise color outline the outside of the amethyst color don't cover up the purple take the color down along the outer lower lash line and stop at the halfway point just blend in the deal so that it has a nice smooth transition into the purple patil and amethyst combination will create this multifaceted effect it's gonna look gorgeous under any different lighting just blend everything out and let's move on to warmer colors i'm holding here the pop eyeshadow trio using an antique metallic color remember when I asked you to leave an empty space on the center of your lids well that's because we're going to fill it in with this regal color and using the highlighter color here at this along the inner area of your eye to help open them up using a real gold eye shadow well not real gold but you know what I mean add this on top of the antique old the combination of purple and gold will give your eyes this royal touch using a rose gold or champagne eyeliner pencil in your water line to brighten up your eyes using your favorite liquid liner that's not black i'm using here and navy color but you can use a dark gray dark brown or dark blue line your eyes starting along the top inner corner of your eyes slowly connecting the lines to extend it out and from here just like the lower lash line just a bit using a blending brush find the natural contour of your eyes and start blending the blue and purple eyeshadow colors to create a hazy finish because of the liquid liner we don't want the eyeshadow to have a hard edge keep it soft and help balance out to look so i've been using this mini shul lash curler it takes a little more time to curl but you really get every single lashes on your eyes that you may have missed and once you're done apply your favorite lash lengthening mascara ardell carry some awesome lashes i'm using here in the 120 demo after cutting them to fit your lashline add a thin strip of glue on the lash band and wait a few seconds for

what do you get when you combine a unicorn with a rainbow a Rainicorn inspired by one of my favorite enchanting characters in Adventure Time Lady has perfectly pink skin so begin by lightly stippling on a base of BB cream or liquid foundation I prefer using a BB or CC cream because it feels lighter than foundation plus it has a moisturizing base will also help moisturize your skin - BAM the power of good concealer is pretty much as good as magic you can use your ring finger to blend or do what I'm doing taking the back of the brush and having to blend all right now we take a cherry red lip

little help from my friend called makeup I can transform myself into the ultimate flapper girl let's start off with foundation to help even out your skin with the stippling brush sponge or your clean fingers apply your foundation on your face I prefer to apply my foundation first around the center of my face because I need a little more coverage here then the rest of my face like forehead engine just make sure to blend so you don't have any Street marks especially down towards your neck all right let's move on to the heavy duty stuff concealing i'm curious to know what kind of makeup they use during the twenties to achieve perfect looking skin today we use stuff like a peachy salmon concealer color because it works wonders on covering up dark circles I prefer to use my gentle ring finger to apply concealer along the delicate area under my eyes all right this step is important applying finishing powder on your face to set the liquid and cream base makeup this will stop it from creasing and will also keep your makeup looking fresh all night long to make sure your skin has a matte finish let's move on to the fun part making up the eyes I'm using here my new brow pencils that just came in called arch by em cosmetics i'm using here the color medium brown and very carefully create your arch skinny over-exaggerated browse was the look unlike today where full brows are in back then every girl was drawing on her brows super thin just like Clara Bow 1920 silent film star let's hurry up with eyeshadow with the medium brush loaded up with the matte taupe color and follow the natural contours of your eyes and once you're happy with how it looks the next color you should use is a matte black shadow and with the same brush use this to contour your crease again only this time it's going to look more intense in the taupe color what you're doing here is creating a strong contour shape to your eyes this will give your eyes more depth when I was coming up at this look I was really inspired by silent film movies be sure to keep the middle area on your legs clean will fill them in later so keep blending and bring the color down along the lower lash line this will help make your eyes appear more round use a shimmery my shadow add this on the area that you kept clean to fill it in with your brush again blend the shadow so that you don't have any harsh edge and using your black eyeliner here i'm using my water liner in black knight line the waterline gliding the pencil back and forth until you're happy with the intensity then bring the pencil up keeping the pencil as close to the lash line as possible and line your eyes we want to make sure that the line is as thin as possible so just keep darkening your eye makeup and with this measure tool smudge the creamy eye liner formula so that it gives your eyes a hazy look using another brush that has the same taupe color on it start where your brows begin and follow the line down the sides of your nose contouring your nose will help bring more definition to your face and after you curl your lashes apply generous coats of waterproof mascara why waterproof because it contains wax which will help hold a curl longer and when you're done with your eyes let's move on to the lips but first we have to reshape them this is a modern take on the Clara Bow lips with the concealer that matches your skin color start erasing the sides of your lips he want them to look smaller than normal we're creating very delicate shaped lips imagine if your lips were shaped like a heart that's kind of what we're going for so conceal a small portion of your upper lip and blend the concealer so that it looks as natural as possible using your powder again set the makeup you can't skip this step or else your lipstick and concealer will slip and slide find a rich red lipstick with the matte finish here i'm using my new matte lipstick in wine stain using a brush line your lips first then fill in the color you want your Cupid's bow to

the bottom part of my brows and work my way up to reshape your brows until you're happy with the look remember they don't have to look identical identical looking brows can sometimes appear to artificial looking so if they're slightly off that's totally fine moving on to the eye makeup i'm going to use this L'Oreal eyeshadow quad that I've had for ages use a combination of the white and shimmering peachy pink and add this along the lower lash line highlight under your eyes to create an illusion of happiness now with this matte taupe or brown color softly create a line underneath the highlighting color this will give an illusion of a shadow use a combination of a darker Matt Brown along the outer part to create an illusion of depth and with your blending brush gently soften the

priming the face i have here printing with the stars from benefit it's a kit filled with some benefits top picks using their eye shadow primer i'm going to . my entire eyes like this so that the primer is evenly distributed and with the delicate ring finger blend away timer not only helps with eyeshadow but it also helps with concealer so take your concealer the 1 i'm using here is from the benefit hit conceal your dark circles and eyelids and blend away with your ring finger and now the concealer is not going to smudge or settle into fine lines and once you're done just dab your eyes with loose powder this will actually help your makeup last longer and then let's move on to eye makeup for the I make apart i'm going to be using Lorax eyeshadow palette and for this tutorial I'm only going to be using my clean fingers to apply my eye shadow if you don't have any brushes or you forgot them on your trip no worries just make sure your fingers are clean and starting with your ring finger tap the base color on your lids gently dab it on like this pretty easy usually you want to use a smaller brush for the darkest color in this case we have our pinky finger the pinky finger will give you better control unlike the rest of the fingers with your pinky finger apply the darkest color along the outer corners of your eyes like this with the middle finger this should act like the fluffy brush blend everything together try not to mix up the fingers or else your eye makeup might end up looking muddy yeah whatever is left on your pinky finger apply this along the lower lash line to balance out your eyes for the highlighter let's use the index finger and apply this color along the brow bone and center of the lid to add more dimension to your eyes now let's take a bronze eyeliner or eyeshadow and add this along the inner corners usually if you want your eyes to have more of a doll like look use highlighter but if you want a more mature look a darker color along the inner corners like this using your black eyeliner line your eyes what i'm doing here is building up my line by making tiny little strokes filling in any empty spaces until I have one solid line time to curl the lashes and get them ready for mascara i'm going to be using to face better than false lashes mascara here at the lash extension system where you prime the iceberg build up the lashes and then seal everything in first step I'm going to wet my lashes with mascara and while the mascara is still wet and using their lash fiber one here i'm going to add a generous amount of their fiber onto my lashes this is going to help build up my lashes so that they're longer with more volume and now just steal everything in with the same mascara from step one not bad right it actually looks like i'm wearing fake lashes all right on to the next step browse her brows have a higher arch than my natural brows so I'm going to have to arched eyebrows a little higher than usual to recreate her brows finally we can move on to the face i am using here of foundation faker from the benefit apparently it's an oil-free cream to powder formula that perfects your complexion but it's not a foundation this is a really nice product but i only recommend it for those who have a good complexion because the coverage is pretty light if you need more coverage is better to use a foundation steal everything in with your powder and let's move on to the cheeks using tarts flesh I'm going to contour my face with this color applying it on the apples of my cheeks and brushing it out again intensify the contour by applying bronzer bronzer will give your face more dimension by creating shadow and whatever is left on your brush just add this along the sides of your forehead to create an illusion of a smaller forehead with an illuminator or highlighter at this on the tip of your eyeshadow brush and then start dabbing it along the highest points on your face your brow bone your cheekbones your skin will instantly look as if it's glowing giving you a healthy looking complexion since I'm kind of in a fancy mood i am going to use is Dolce & Gabbana bronzer scourges this is what the bronzer looks like honestly I didn't want to use it and I saved it just for this video so here goes as you can see the first application will be intense because of the black pigment from the leopard spots so make sure to really really blend after all the leopard spots are gone it's just going to be a normal bronzer for the lips i'm going to give them a mini spa by exfoliating all the flaky skin off this is the victoria's secret lip scrub scrub it's are made out of sugar so if you really want to make your own sugar lip scrub just add sugar to Vaseline and use that as a scrub instead wipe everything off with

not too top-heavy this will balance out the eye makeup now with your blending brush softly blend the edges so it's not so harsh looking and once you're done take a black eyeliner the one I'm using here is by starlet line your eyes as usual winger your eyes just a bit and line your waterline to intensify this look more and take your brush to soften the eyeliner now you're ready for mascara carlashes using a volumizing mascara of your choice i'm using their real benefit apply generous coats of mascara and tell you happy yeah yeah and i'm going to use the bigger version of Matt to contour

it's beautifully bold good lack yeah yeah to get this beautiful hypnotic look have your face foundation ready and let's move straight into the eyes select a lilac eyeshadow color and apply this color on the outer corners of your eyes blend around this area and try to keep the rest of the eye area clean next step take a black sparkling color and sculpt this color on your crease and lower lash line with your blending brush blend everything out to create a subtle smokey effect load up your brush with the silver color and run this along the inner lower lash line this will help brighten up the eyes now take the silver glittering eye shadow color and with your finger just dab it on the center of your lids this will give your eyes a glamorous look and from here on up you can add more of the black eyeshadow to intensify your eyes just be sure to blend everything away you want this look to be extremely soft and hazy no hard edges with the smaller brush loaded up with a black eye shadow and line this on your waterline this will help give your eyes and edgy look and once you're done with the waterline just take your favorite black eyeliner here i'm using our liner and line your eyes I like to start with a thinner line and then taper out to exaggerate the shape of my eyes also don't forget to line your lower lash line halfway to balance out the shape of your eyes if you line it all the way it can sometimes make your eyes appear smaller yeah and now it's time for the lashes my lashes are not only thin but they grow straight down so i have to give him a lift when it comes to building up my lashes I prefer to use a two-step process where I use a mascara base to thicken and lengthen my lashes now that my lashes are nicely marinated with the CIL's booster I can now use my Hypnose star mascara this brush is really nice because one side is flat helping deposit a generous amount of product on my lashes while the other side is round which helps separate and lengthen my lashes this is

color and then blend away remember try not to like the top part of your eyes we want the eyes to be a little bottom heavy for this casual look we don't want your eyes to look too bright we kind of want them to have almost like a sleepy look I know that sounds a little weird but honestly it's one of the few times and advocating a sleepy look next step carlashes some of you who don't need a corner lashes are so lucky my lashes grow straight down so i have two columns and then apply generous coats of mascara I like to do this trick where I take the mascara juan and hold it vertically and I give my lashes a few good swipes then afterwards I like to comb it through horizontally it really helps get more product on my lashes this trick is a great way to make it look like you're wearing eyeliner for the face finish it off with bronzer and blush personally i like to use bronzer first to sculpt and contour my face and then I like to use blush to add color and now we can finally move on

colors I'm going to make a few dots and with a brush soaked in nail polish remover dab it on the dot you'll notice right away that the nail polish remover is dissolving the drops of color keep having it around this will create a beautiful watercolor effect it's really important to apply top coat on top of your base color before adding the color drops or else the nail polish remover will dissolve your base color repeat the same steps to all your nails just have fun with it and when you're done just apply top coat and now your watercolor nails are finished and finally i'm ready to head out here's my outfit knee high boots are very in for autumn since the boots are so edgy with all the buckles I decided to pair it with my casual 10 bag to balance out the edginess of the boots ok now it's time to eat I give huge props to any restaurant with purse hooks I don't like having my back on the floor i recommend finding a sushi restaurant near university because they tend to be a little cheaper sushi restaurants are so fun because it requires you to share a menu with your date so you can talk and be really interactive with your date instead of just sitting there twiddling with your thumbs sushi is also very healthy you can eat a lot and not feel so bad and if you don't eat fish sushi restaurants usually carries chicken and vegetable tempura dishes this is actually how I break apart my chopsticks always breaks evenly and this is how I hold my chopsticks how do you guys hold your chopsticks do you hold it my way or his way salmon is my favorite fish and I love getting a spicy tuna handle what's your favorite thing to order the sushi restaurant to all the ladies out there if you can handle the bill do your thing but if you can trying to attempt to offering to help pay such a friendly gesture other than that just be yourself he should like you for you good luck and have fun on your date music by kina grannis back to us and david Choi this and that is life scared yeah by summer it's autumn again let's start off with a copper color inspired by autumn leaves stay around the lash line with this copper color using a color like copper will help warm up any of your neutral colors that you're going to layer over so won't look as dull and gray next take a neutral brown matte shade and run this along the lower lash line this is going to give your eyes a hazy look bring the natural matte brown color up to your crease and blend out take a fluffy brush and soften everything out i Swan now take a champagne color that has a pearl texture and depth this on the inner corners and middle part of your eyes yeah No can you then blend everything out take a matte black eyeshadow and contour your crease very lightly dab the color along the outer third of your lash line with a blending brush soften the black eyeshadow keep the eyeshadow as smokey as possible we don't want any harsh edges yeah yeah so now line your eyes of the black eyeliner you and line your waterline with an angled eyeliner brush blend your creamy eye liner to create an edge using an angled eyeliner brush can help redefine your eyeliner pencil using liquid liner alone might look too harsh if you layer it over pencil cream or powder it will bring softness to the liquid liner and using your favorite mascara give it a few good coats yeah yeah No redefine your brows and give them the shape that complements your eyes want you here right intensify the lower lash line with your black eyeliner this will help balance your eyes garage next step take your fake lashes and apply a generous amount of glue on them wait 30 seconds until the glue becomes tacky and stick this on your lashes apply a little bit of eyeliner to hide the lash line even if the glue dries clear sometimes it has a shiny texture you have to sometimes mattify that texture and now your autumn eyes are done it's a simple look I'll go with any autumn outfit as much as I'm gonna miss summer I'm really looking forward to autumn fashion please thumbs up if you like to see Adam fashion looks i hope you enjoyed this video good luck music by david Choi by my side yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah ok yeah yeah

don't forget to subscribe to my channel here or work might reverse those come here give me your follow me on facebook if you want daily updates shopbop.com i'm always blogging every day on Instagram I'm always taking random photos of stuff for myself going to do yeah she got to get out of the office I've been here all day and I need a life good luck everyone and love you I got my glasses are crooked good luck everyone I'll see you on the next video I'll ride schools here you guys don't seem so excited ok I don't blame you summer breaks are way more fun but that doesn't mean you can't look cute for school you first want to get some colorful nail polishes and with the spoon or mixing palette tape is the answer to life take your fingers because you want to protect them from the splatter here i'm going to show you how to create splatter nails and with extra virgin olive oil put them on the sides of her nails to protect them from the splatter will also help condition your cuticles clearly I need some of that we e well a cloud parts and a bundle face it's only take your nail polish remover or nail thinner I know most of you guys will have nail polish remover because i don't have no thinner you just need a few drops of nail polish and makes a tiny amount of nail polish remover in your mixing palette find a toothbrush with a hard bristle that you're not using or a brow brush and with your thumb like the brush did you see that now with different colors just have fun all it's really up to you in your comfort level you can stay clean with a few splatters or you can go super crazy like me and then working with you one that a gril know I was cold and you knew I'm basically doing layers and layers until well it looks like this mess yeah i know but if this is a little too much for you I have another nail trick that you can mess around with that's a little more subdued i like to call it drip nails so get your colors ready and with a regular pencil just make random slowly marks like this you want to keep making these worlds with different colors basically just keep the drip pattern keeps swirling everything around think like a marble does that even make sense it may appear really thick looking on your nails but don't worry because it's going to dry them who is me you have to that's my kiss you're hot despite dip the pencil into the white nail polish and give it one last swirl and that's it once it's completely dry just top code it and you're pretty much ready to go alright so now for the makeup start out with your naked face yes I said naked I'm starting off with skincare first now with skincare i'm using equal 0 cellular activator facial serum first you know what the same it's a long name is going to work so what I'm using here is a serum basically a sara is like a liquid specialist they basically address specific needs some can be for wrinkles firming age spots whitening hyperpigmentation scars whatever it is there's a serum for it the molecule in serums are much smaller than the moisturizers molecule which means you want to use it right away because it will penetrate deeper and deliver all the goodness into your skin and don't forget to apply your moisturizer after sarren because you want to hydrate your skin even if you have oily skin you still have to use a moisturizer try using an oil free formula instead fun fact about this Brandi close it's actually a plant-based skincare line and their ceremony boys riser here has stem cells plant stem cells to be exact I wouldn't put human stem cells on my face all right moving on to sunscreen you're going to need at least SPF 15 so show your skin some love and protect it next step a little bit of foundation use it to even out your skin tone I know you guys keep hearing these sailors but I'm a huge believer that less is more far beyond the mismatch of person ah and using a sponge will help blend your foundation giving you that flawless airbrushed look please any next step using mineral powder again so when I was in Australia a really sweet subscriber name in gave me this amazing miracle in a red tube called luca's papa did I say that right guys anyways I love this stuff it's amazing you know what time it is everyone its brow time get in there and groom your brows nicely shaped browse will give your face more balanced this is bound to get messy but I don't care all right ladies you want to invest in a good neutral eyeshadow palette because the color taupe will go a long way using a brush or a sponge applicator apply this foolproof color as close to the lash line as possible and then the lower lash line taupe is a great contour shade it helps bring more dimension to your eyes and now it's time for the pretty eye shadow color using salty cosmetics loose eyeshadow powder in glamazon would focus around the inner corners of the eyes first it should be concentrated here and then blend out just a bit yeah the top was gonna need a little bit of that glamazon way to you see how subtle this makeup is it just comes to show you that you don't always need crazy colors to make a statement and whatever is left over on your brush or sponge brush it on your brow bone depending on your comfort level use a liquid liner to line your eyes the reason why I'm such a huge fan of liquid liners is because they tend to last longer that's what you're going to need for a long school day so line your eyes and draw another line to create fake lashes like this now it's time to curl your lashes and apply your favorite mascara you want to use waterproof mascara if your eyelids are oily or if you live in a really humid climate and cut the lower lash line ever using a waterproof formula me all right I sure does and now it's time for blush I'm using this creamy blush i bought at target apply a paint brush color around the apples of your cheeks usually when I wake up I look super pale so i need to add a little bit of life back into my face blush is the answer yeah and here i have to meet her roll on perfume oil so you're probably wondering what's your perfume oil perfume oils are the scented ingredient that gives regular perfumes colognes soaps shampoos Kendall's their smell perfume oil has you know alcohol so won't irritate the skin it will last longer because the alcohol can dilute the scent of the perfume you want to apply this on your wrist behind your ear and neck area mmm i love smelling good ok i'm almost done but I need your help i need you guys to help me pick a lip gloss color to finish off this look which one should I choose first one second one third one yes no maybe so still waiting guys guys I know you can choose a color and help me but if you're indecisive and it's okay because I'm always like that then I'm just going to use a pink lip gloss my mother didn't really allow me to wear makeup until I was in high school however i was allowed to wear lip gloss all right i hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial good black music by mari a dick be and let me know if there's any details that you like for me to film i'll be uploading new videos every Monday and Thursday so it's you me and a solo left also cad hi everyone i'm going to show you how to create the cyber gothic anime look it's perfect for four states interviews weddings that is if you're living in an enemy world get your headphones ready because this look might take a while to recreate i'm going to start out with my poor reducing primer and apply this on any wrinkly poorest area on your face this is going to smooth out any of your fine lines and fill in your pores to create a smooth canvas to work on with the liquid foundation that's a few shades lighter than your own skin color . the foundation all over your face yep keep going more a little mark stop here and a little here how do you think that looks good now let's . a few more haha just kidding yeah take your blending sponge and blend out the foundation sponges are wonderful tools that's great for blending and creating stuff looks with your favorite concealer to conceal any blemishes dark circles watching us anime girls have perfect skin and since no one really has perfect skin unless your baby you want to pack that concealer on your place with your powder set your makeup by powdering the foundation and concealer yeah powder helps set any texture that's moisture wet that's not dirty all right time for eyeshadow yes my favorite part using a luminous eyeshadow dab this all over your crease area aluminous eyeshadow adds color to your eyes without making it look like you're wearing eye shadow and with a copper color apply this shade on your crease and follow the natural contour on your eyes notice how this creates dimension to the eyes we all know your eyes already have dimension but with makeup or exaggerating it using a matte taupe color keep intensifying the contour of your eyes until you've reached that level of definition that you're satisfied with ok and now it's time to draw on your eyes if you're good at drawing anime or manga this will be easy peasy using a creamy black pencil eyeliner make sure it's creamy because we don't want the pencil to drag on your eyes right above your crease start drawing the outline of your anime I shape it should look like this a cat eye shape but way above the crease line take your matte black eyeshadow and start coloring in if you're good at coloring inside the lines as a child this should be no problem for you start sketching out anime lower lashes should be chunky and pointing and don't forget the upper lashes they should be skinny and pointing there are hundreds of different enemy I shapes that you can use if you need to use reference photos of anime or manga to help you find the one that fits your eye shape best hey don't play with the makeup take a bright color choice i decided to use a vivid purple color for this one apply the bright color along the upper and lower lash line of the eyes and softly blend it leave the middle part empty because if you fill it in it might look a little too dark and gothic with a champagne color dab a bit of this highlighter along the lower lash line to brighten up the eyes for this look it's all about making the eyes look bigger next step curl your lashes and get them nice and perky for mascara using your favorite mascara like my matches the color of my eyeshadow apply generous coats on your lashes keep building up your lashes you want sky-high lashes and if you still need help finish off the eyes with fake lashes break your lashes in so they're not too stiff kind of like breaking into your new jeans you know what to do apply glue and stick them on we're not done yet with your brow pencil failing your browser like you normally do but before you finish take an eyeliner pencil in the similar shape to your bright eyeshadow color my hair is purple and fill in your brows colored browse intensify the colors of your eye shadow with the matte bronzer or a matte taupe eyeshadow concert the sides of your nose this will make your nose look more skinny using a matte white eyeshadow apply this as highlighter and apply along the bridge of my nose to create an illusion of a taller knows also apply this on the high point of your cheeks to bring out your cheekbones and with the bronzer you all know the deal contour your cheeks and add more definition to the face yeah and apply natural looking blush to add softness back into your face for the lips i'm going to use a nude lip liner because I'm going to make my lips look smaller by reducing the size of my lips I'm going to do this by erasing the edges of my lips the more you erase the outline of your lips the smaller your lips look your new lip pencil should be as close to your skin color as possible blend the pencil until you don't see any marks afterwards take a pink lips take and with a brush load it up and add the color on the center of your lips you want your lips to look softer and delicate because enemy lips are usually just a thin line you don't want the edges of your lips to appear too sharp keep in mind that the smaller and delicate your lips look the larger your eyes will look and if you really want your eyes look bigger pop on your enemy eyeballs also known as circle lens I been an aide you need that we were done with brush em last step finish up with the hot pink blush to give you that sweet finish now I look flying I hope you all enjoyed this tutorial i had a lot of fun doing it i'm going to head off to church now peace out everyone good luck yeah yeah hey guys today I'm doing this makeup look right here and this is a last-minute easy simple glam holiday makeup tutorial perfect for thanksgiving or for whenever the holidays they're happening like i said in my previous video I wanted to create something that everyone can do it is so easy like literally this look is easier than easy i know i said on social media that I wanted to keep those look very simple and on the low but knowing me I of course have to go in with a blinding silver on my lids but I will assure you that this is super easy to do anyone can do this it is using mostly affordable products so this is one that everyone can do I think this is such a fun look for winter for whenever you want to blind anyone with your glam and yeah if you would like to know how to get this easy glam makeup look for the holidays then keep watching ok the first products i'm gonna go in with is a primer because you want your face to last all night long unless you're not wearing any makeup then skip whatever i'm saying that doesn't everybody why are you watching the video so I'm gonna go in with this NYX Hydra touch primer and this is to hydrate and moisturize and I have dry skin so I need all the moisturization i can get going to use this as a moisturizing primer and then on my t-zone area where I get a little bit more oily and where my parts are more visible no go in with the Maybelline Baby skin instant pore eraser and the trick with primers like this is to top them in to the area you don't want to necessarily wipe or massage it in because you wanted to really fill up that poor and you race it so I find that it does that best when the top in products like that for this area not going to go in with the Milani conceal and perfect two-in-one foundation + concealer which are lies because i never used for concealer i use your information alone and I'm in the color 01 creamy vanilla and then with my Beauty Blender and the bound said into my skin [Music] and please use as much foundation as you are comfortable with using as little or as much as you like i'm known to like my layers upon layers upon layers upon layers but that doesn't mean you should follow that rule exactly how i do it please take inspiration from this video you don't have to exactly copy every step do whatever makes you feel comfortable for concealer today I'm going to go in with the Maybelline instant age rewind concealer in the color fair and because i like a little bit more likeness with my concealer i'm going to go in with the pro concealed by la girl in the color thank you for letting me know my previous video that they actually do make a white concealer because they wouldn't have it and bouncing that in using my Beauty Blender again now i'm going to bake my under eye area to prevent it from creasing and to make it look flawless all night long and i'm going to set the rest of my face using Maybelline a better skin super-state powder and number 10 ok and with my sigma f 89 brush gonna wipe away the baked underneath my eyes [Music] this shouldn't come as a surprise but a first timing my eyelids to make the look last all day long using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and I mean yeah you can try a different primer I just know that soft ochre ensures me of having my look on all night for all day long so i change it up for the crease and outer corner and going in with her beauty's rose gold palette in the shade sandalwood but please trust me when I say you can use any media warm brown it doesn't depend which brand just make sure it's a mat warm medium brown and I'm starting off by placing most intensity on the outer corner here touching the lid and the police to start making little circle motions to blend it out and as your blending work your way up higher up into your crease from there you can lightly swipe it into the center of the crease and all I'm doing is soft circle motion you know you want to think of it as whenever you want to blend something out you want to create circle motions think of it as the wheels of the blending brush go round and round then once you have most definition apply to the outer portion of the I now you can swipe whatever is the left in the brush to work the inner portion of decreased but dude is very softly and not to hajj now with a more dense concentrated brush and that same color really build up definition on that out of fun here we're not focusing on the crease here just on this outer portion super easy just focusing on that outer portion and leaving everything else behind now going to go in with this color pop super shock shadow this looks amazing and it's in the color glitterati and you can choose to apply this color with your fingers or with the brush and then he is both i like using my fingers to kind of stamp the product down onto my lid and then with the brush I refine the shape this may be a simple look but i still want to catch all the attention so over top of the colour-pop product i'm applying this Maybelline eye shadow in the color New York silver for maximum impact of that shady you want to tap the product onto the lid so see how I'm not swiping the brush at all I'm tapping it up and down this is to get the maximum coverage of my eyeshadow as a base on my inner corners are using this mix lingerie I tint and going over top using this inglot pure pigment and number 75 blinding first laying down that cream product to really make that highlight pop stick go over top using the link now I personally obsess over strong inner corner highlights they just hope that just made me warm on the inside but if you feel like that is too much simply go in with a little q-tip kind of rub the surface of the highlight to tone it down and it should become a lot more soft for the lower lash line and going back in with that medium brown color from the crease and applying it to the outer third of my lower lashline only using a flat definer brush and we use that flat definer brush to really pack on the color and to get it there and then we go in with a pencil brush to blend and smoke it out and by keeping that definition on the outer portion of the lower lashline only it will open up the eyes in such a beautiful flattering way but it won't drag them down to make him look too heavy a little bit of white Michael on the waterline and now all we have to do is apply some fun flirty lashes these Arlena lashes in the style Naomi and a lot of people always ask me how you can master applying false lashes and in the screen here i will show you a video that create a long time ago is not the technique that he used today anymore but it definitely helped me getting into a pine false lashes a lot better so that's a great way of starting out and in the screen here you can click the video and check it out all right to contract today I'm going to go in with the makeup geek contouring powder I'm gonna go with this shade right here this one is called a breakup and I know these are super super pigmented so you only need the tiniest bit you know find the top of that cheekbone and go right underneath to cast a shadow and to make it look like it's carved most people on Thanksgiving are carving a turkey I'm coming with you oh my god you guys are going to love this part for blush and bring back an old favorite this one is milani Luminoso blush this one is oh I think this is the greatest blush ever created in makeup kind and it goes perfectly with the lips i'm applying later on and with the warmth in the outer corners and the crease and i'm applying this using the morphe y 1 this will launch in two days on Friday nothing tops this blush and having used in a while because just like all other products i kinda have the tendency to use them too many times and I just had to let it go for a little bit to try out new things and for you guys to see different variations on blush because I was always using woman so and it's kind of scaring me because now that i'm wearing it again i am falling in love all over again and we're with every look for highlighter today I'm going to go in with the blinding Katrice glam fusion shadow in the color Jon Snow favorite your no neck and Jan's snare i suck at that because you know if people are going to come for your makeup on Thanksgiving the least you can do is blind them know people were scared that I wouldn't do a blinding glove because i was doing a simple look for things giving a like a last-minute simple thumb look honey I need my binding glow without by blinding glow i am just which makes me think maybe I should sometimes you and all matte look without a glowing like a blinding glow it's the end of my channel between 0 and therefore lips are going to keep it very very simple i know with Thanksgiving you're going to stuff your face so you probably wouldn't even wear lipstick but let's say for the photos right before the dinner or after the dinner i love the combination of silver and peach I just it's so magical to me like it works together so today I'm going to go in with the new Kylie lip kit color called dirty peach I've seen this color go around Instagram so many times and every time I see it I'm like oh of course you could go for Glaus nothing a lip stain red nude dark do whatever you want do whatever you feel comfortable with because i feel like these eyes go with pretty much every single lip color out there so whatever you want to bother your lips you put on your lips and then just set this all into place i need a spritz of setting spray I'm gonna go in with the Knicks Julie finish bench and that guy's concludes this simple a last-minute holiday glam makeup tutorial using mostly silver and peaches I surprise only had a lot of fun with this look I really love how it turned

this is what i came up with i created this duochrome pink Cup crease like really fierce I makeup look and it played with a lot of new products for this video today I'm and I i must say i really really like it i know i didn't upload on wednesday because i was sick I i think i have the flu or something it was a really really bad cold but I'm back and better and i'm playing with the hub UT rose gold palette today I've heard a lot of things about this i'm going to play with it today and see how i like it so yeah if you would like to know how to get this look for thanksgiving or whenever you want to slay your face and knocked everyone out of the part and rock everyone's socks off a look if you want to know how to look like that then keep on watching please please please alright so since we want to look glowing and moisturised and a beautiful for things giving the first thing I'm gonna go in with is Kim ties and wonder lush in collaboration with ofra again this is a test or form I've been with her through this process since the beginning so I'm this is not the final but its not its final form but this moisturizer is just amazing it leaves a glow it leaves you looking beautifully taking care of it's just life and more ah the life right now for foundation I'm going to go into a new product this is x la girl and this is called the pro coverage HD along where illuminating foundation it looks a lot like makeup forever i have the color porcelain right here but they also came out with a 1l a girl yes yes and yes you are representing as ghosties out there i love this i love this you can lighten any foundation or concealer with this i love that this is perfect what it's so revolutionary thank you for breaking the rules thank you got that coverage oh god only girl I see you it has a lovely dewy finish did have averaged now if only they could just follow their own revolution every break of rules by doing a white concealer as well that will really make my day I will say though the foundation remains very wet like do you see how it's almost what like I have wet skin like I'm sweating I'm not sure if I'm the biggest fan of that I kinda like it when it sets down and becomes a little bit more dry this is still very very wet for concealer gonna go in with the kat von d lock-it concealer creams in l1 and l3 and I've heard that these are a little bit more dry so trying to counteract the wetness of the foundation with the dryness of the concealer let's see if this will make it a perfect mixture of wet and dry and now going to set my under eye area to prevent it from creasing all right now to set the rest of my face using the Maybelline better skin super-state powder in 10 but my fear is with really wet foundations when you set it with powder it kind of moves the foundation right before you said it leaving it looking very disrupted and like messy so my fear is that that will happen so before i go in with my powder just make sure that it's in parish they're ready to be set with powder you guys are so sad I had such high hopes for this foundation once I first applied it I got so excited because it has beautiful coverage but it just remains so wet alright so the first thing I'm doing as always is priming using my soft or group in pot by Mac and now going to go in with the hoodie Beauty rose gold palette and going in first with the color shy or just blending this into the crease to build our definition and as a transition color for all the Jets and darkness that will come in later and for this look we're going to go all the way into the inner crease and all the way out now using the color bossy i'm going to deepen and intensify that and again taking this from inner to outer corner now to really cut the crease we're going to cut the lid by using Pro Longwear concealer by mac and with this we're going to really clean up the lid going right up against that crease color to cut it and I'm gonna set that all using angelic now I'm going to blend and smoke out that crease just at a bit more using a mix of bossy and man-eater all right now going to create a wing using my Tom Ford I defining pen in deeper from there you want to create your basic wing and filling in using my favorite MAC liquid last liner in black and now from that wing i'm going to swoop one clean line into the cut crease and now you want to softly buff black above that wine to give it a night planned for the lower lash i'm going to go back in with bossy and just smoking up that outer lower lash line and then on the inner corner I'm going back in with angelic and as a transition right in between going in with henna going into this beautiful Murphy highlighting palette and taking the two pink shades to highlight my inner corner all right all we need not to finish off our lashes and i'm going to go in with the any 22 snobby lashes and for my lower lashes are going to be using the mac extended play get a black lash alright eyes are done and looking beautiful for thanksgiving or whatever your 1m ok so now we're going to go over to contouring oh I'm so obsessed with this powder this is better dial and it's the instant go and compact deluxe contouring powder number three it is so good i'm just gonna think in those chain balls with this is honey it's six given we will be eating so we want to carve those cheeks out to look bloated and also doing my jawline with this and if you don't have a jawline like I do we're going to create warden actually quit my realness all right now for blush I'm gonna go for a nice mix of peach and pink this is my Sigma they create one of my all-time favorite brushes called the aura powders this one is in the color nymphaea and I'm gonna use this new brush right here it's a yellow gold handle these are brand-new morphe brushes they launched on November 25th and this is the y1 just that yellow gold he asked okay that work on a blush up nothing too crazy because the eyes are like pretty pretty intense but you definitely do want a hint of the niceness ok and therefore highlighter i am really really obsessing over those two Pink's that is also applied to the inner corners so i'm going to apply those as my cheek highlights only is another one of those new brushes my morphe this is the Y 14 and this is such a perfect highlighting brush I'm gonna go in with the darkest one first to put some to put the foundation down to put the to ground it yes so I put that color down to get the color of the pinkness really going but then to blind it i'm going to go in with the lighter pink one just on the center of my highlight portion to make it just wow that's what I'm talking about this in real life looks like magic like it's beautiful on camera don't get me wrong but in real life it's just a tad bit more intense of a pink so crazy cool alright for lips i want to create a really cool glossy metallic finish so as the basic gonna go in with a beautiful nude this is by Maybelline and this is in the color 530 hot sand and then overtopping to go in with a product that has fascinated me for the longest time these are who is she cosmetics lip hybrids and these are a mix of a gloss long-wearing stain / liquid lipstick explain it is so magical if you follow them on Instagram a mind blown and they make a lot of really cool metallic colors so I want to go in with this color right here it has a

here for you i love the little stars were going to be playing with today they just give such a fun twist and of course if you're feeling frisky or you have a party to go to you can always replicate that look that the girls are going on with all the glitter and rhinestones where they would apply their highway it's just such a cool cool music video and Perry looked amazing and I'm so excited to be showing you this look today so yeah I think without any further ado let's give Zane the middle finger but without any further ado if you would like to know how to get this makeup look right here then people cheering alright so the first thing I'm gonna do for this perrie edwards makeup look is moisturize my face to get a nice base to work with and I'm going to be using this little magic pot right here this is a new / product that will be launching january second and it's in collaboration with one of my best friends Kim Tae congratulations baby and this is still a tester form because I've been trying to smush Ty's are out for a couple of months now and I fallen in love with it and i not only love it as a moisturizer I think it is perfect to use as a base underneath your makeup because it really makes any product that you put over top grab onto it and really adhere to the skin so I think it's a great makeup base and that's why I'm using it today and no this will not be the final packaging i cannot even begin to tell you how good it is to finally be able to talk about this can let me try this I think three months ago and I've been obsessed ever since but I couldn't talk about it now I finally can love this stuff for foundation I'm going to be using this one by Mac this one is called the pro longwear nourishing waterproof foundation i'm in the color and see 15 and this was also the foundation that her makeup artist used for her for the music video and i'm applying this using my Beauty Blender dog and for concealer today I'm gonna go in with the urban decay naked skin concealer and the color fair neutral and of course also blending it in order to render a I'm trying to step away from using the top shape concealer but after using the shape tape for so long and then stepping back to another one it's just such a disappointment like nothing in my eyes can compare to shoot at this moment but nothing and now i'm going to set my under eye area with powder to prevent throne creasing that's just that the rest of my face and go in with this maybelline superstay better skin powder i discovered this in New York and ever since I've been in love with it it just beautifully sets your makeup and keeps it on all day long plus it's affordable I am really really really obsessed with this one ok now with Max shivering white powder going to highlight my under eye area using this new brush that I've been really really liking it's the stigma bake kabuki f-89 brush and I think it's the perfect size and width and density for the under eye area to just flawlessly apply that on your highlight or just do or just to set your bank or get rid of your it's just a really really good under eye brush see it's pervert already i'm going to do my eyebrows off camera and then we'll be back before i do anything on the eyes and the Prime to make this look last all day long and this is my mac soft ochre Paint Pot the first color I'm going to go in with is by the morphe 35o em paulo and discovered here is going into my crease and we're software going to focus this more towards the insight crease so see how I'm pulling focus right here on that inner crease that's where you want to go don't your fridge google high up in that crease if you have a lot of space to work with use it now hopping over to this shape right here for more definition but softer definition in the crease we're just continuing defining that crease we just don't want the color to be as dark and intense on this outer portion here we want the focus to go here on that increase now with the darkest color of the palette i'm going to define that increase even more so we're creating a cut crease definition here and although we haven't cut the crease really once we go in with the lip color and really go against that line it will look as if we had a couple is going on all the time and what this i think you can see that i really mean that we want all the definition to be a met in our cruise right here don't be afraid to go all the way in hopping over to the morphe 35o shimmer pallid and taking the very lightest color to cut the lid and you'll see by me going right up against that line of the crease it will give you that cut crease illusion and continue blinding that lid using that same shade and also highlighting the inner corner using that same shade using a combination of the two crease colors i'm slightly defining the outer V for the waterline first going to go in with these you ways limb cream eyeliner in matte black and then taking the darkest color from the crease again from morphe 35o and palate and smoking it out and then we're also bringing that out slightly for my wing today our first lining out using the tongue forward I defining in deeper and fill in using my favorite MAC liquid last liner all right now with black shadow is really important to diffuse and smoke out the outer corner of that liner and kind of like it out as well so that is exactly what we're doing with the pencil brush I'm softly smoking back out little by little until becomes beautiful Hayes same sort of like that nice and smoky for lashes i'm going to go in with one of my all-time favorite styles these are be Lily lashes in the style tease and for the little star I'm putting down a little bit of lash glue and then sticking the start right over top alright first for cheeks let's do a little bit and by a little i mean a lot of contouring I found out about this new product right here this is my Road aisle and it's the instant glam compact deluxe contouring powder and number three and this is what it looks like and honestly if you're using it in New York with Maybelline and it just it has changed my world you only need a tiny bit of it it has the perfect color to make it look like a shadow as an actual contour as opposed to like a warm brown muddy mess and I've been really really liking it so that's what I'm going to use today to contact with oh I honestly want to look so pinch and so singed and so pull together i'm going in with the powder and what I enjoy most about little mix is that they love their glam they are true British glam goddesses and i love that I love it when is the artist that just upset over glam like I do is just connected connected by birth ok so we're looking to pull together that's a really bronze up my face I'm gonna go in with another one of those powders but this is number two and this is a lot more bronzy a lot more warm and this is perfect for light skin tones early bronze with so from the contour i'm using this as a blush but coming from the contour so it's like a warm contour blush Rob's yes and I'll always left to do is blind highlight go all out so the first highlight oh yes and there will be to the first highlighting go in with is by Makeup Forever look at this this one is in the color pro-lite fusion undetectable Luminizer number one and the brush i'm gonna use is a more fiar 36 really highly enjoying this to highlight with oh yeah baby we're going baby oh baby no stopping now no going back now we're blood ok right on the center of that to really make a pop my morphe pressed pigment and champagne nights this is everything and more and just needed a life and just launched charges softly blind the more I'm upset and I'm going to highlight the bridge of my nose using that more press statement alright and for lips you want to go for one of those classic darker almost Instagram nude colors and i found my match in GA lip cream in the color Tara [Music] and I think all we need not to

today I'm doing a review / tutorial on the new kylie jenner burgundy pallid this recently came out and no one kindly during its probably blowing up the internet but this is what this gorgeous little creature looks like now personally before i start off this got sent to my mom's home address and every Kylie product i've talked about in the past before i have bought with my own money and got sent to this place right here where i live and i went to my mom's place and she was like you have a package so i opened the package up and it turn out to be highly Jenner and I was like oh how did she get that address but I think it's so cool that Kylie sent me her fall collection now of course when you are positive about kylie jenner a lot of people think you're being bought or you sold your soul or that you're being sponsored not trust me Kylie has not sponsored any of my videos she sells a bunch she sells enough product without my support so no Kylie didn't sponsored my last video she isn't sponsoring this one and trust me with the FCC rules I it will be illegal for me not to tell you if this was sponsored so let's get that out of the way now let me tell you about the bronze palette the bronze palette wasn't really my cup of tea I love the colors but my main issue with that palette was that the shimmers were really not kind of shimmery and the mats i found that the more you blended them on your I they all turn out to be the same color so I wasn't a huge fan of that pallet now this one however hope ball i created these very grungy warm-toned smokey eyes for fall and i must say i am really impressed with this palette the palate looks like this and of course the tears have the colors in chrome of what's inside not this is what the inside looks like it comes with nine shadows which are 2345 maths and for shimmers it still doesn't include a mirror although Kylie has set herself on her snapchat that the next palette will have a mirror and honey for $42 mirror yeah we have nine alisios cranberry warm fall rich I shadows and I personally I love these colors especially that metal 1 i'm running on the inner corners the Malaysian obsessed so yeah without any further ado let's hop right into the demo / tutorial on this look right here using the palette so you can see how the shadows work on my eyes how I like them i'll give you my feedback on every shape that i use and let's just get comfortable and relax and let's enjoy this kylie jenner bergen appellate review all right the first thing before he'd do anything with this palette is prime because i want this to last all day long this is my mac software her paint pot the first color gonna go in with is penny and I'm just defining my crease with this now as we can see the pigment on penny is in sane and I love the color I love the warm i love that orange tone would still looks it looks like a mat copper almost is crazy pigmented it blends into the socket like a dream with such ease obsessed with penny now i'm going to go into brick and defining my inner and outer corner for a halo smoky eye ok the pigment of the mats is insane i read into a couple of problems with the maps in the previous palette I just felt like once you blend everything together it all just kind of looked like the same color but this is pigmented a velvety smooth and it just it's so easy to work with [Music] I'm just going to smoke out and blend in the edges to give it a nice smooth gradient and to make sexy and seductive for this halo smokey eye and then a darkened the inner and outer corner even more using almond honestly you guys i am really impressed with the map for the center of the lid i'm going to go in with the color dubai okay okay yeah okay not okay this isn't a bad shadow I just feel like the consistency is very thin it's almost as if the shadow is really thin like it takes a little bit more effort and pressure to get the pigmentation of the shimmer to work and I mean once it's on it's stunning I just feel like it's it's where to explain but it's a very thin type of eyeshadow also not gonna lie i expected that color to be a little bit more chromatic and extreme so we're going to do is go over top with the bronze the bronze is called la and this is going right on the center of Dubai ok that is the stunning color but again I feel like the shadow itself is a thin shit it's so hard to swing it's a thinner shadow but I mean once it's on it is absolutely stunning and beautiful i just feel like it's a it's an odd texture for a shimmer I should because if it's quite fit for my lower lash I'm gonna go back into brick and smoke that baby out and for the inner portion of the lower lash I'm going to be applying burgundy oh my god this car yes ok it has a little bit of all out that colored oh oh my god its fall in an eyeshadow ok deepening the entire lower lash line using almond again and lastly going to highlight my inner corners using naked ok ok i know a lot of people are not the biggest fan of this color but I think heard up with all the beautiful warm tones this on the inner corners makes it so sultry and different I mean yes it's too dark for my skin tone but somehow i don't mind did weirdly enough though the texture and formula that feels away different than the other shimmers I used so this one feels a little bit more dense a little bit more easy to work with and Jessica lights on easier to finish off the look i'll be applying some falsies these are literally lashes in the style tease [Music] alright so eyes done my cheeks almost done i think we still need a bunch of glow for this look because the matter if its fall winter spring summer we need to go i'm gonna go in with my current favorite highlighter which is by morphy it's a pressed pigment and it's in the color champagne nights and its just oh it's everything so i am just go no blind and we can't forget about the tip of the nose you either loved it or hated I guess we know which team I'm on and to finish off this look I think it will only be fitting if I apply a Kylie lip kit color dirty peach page or mm-hmm from God let's do moon to make it super super fall in like all right just like that now we're going to do a little spritz of settings free to lock this into place and we call it a day and that guy's is how the kylie jenner burgundy paulo works on the eyes I overall think it's a really really cool palette I mean the shimmers do need a little bit more love when applying them but the man would talk about the mats the mats are absolutely insane they're smooth buttery painted and they are so easy to work with I am really really impressed by these maths my absolute favorite shade of the entire palette is penny it is just so rich and the ability to make it look like a mat copper is insane to me i love it so much so um yeah for me the kylie jenner burgundy palette gets a huge he has a highly recommended it is a pricey palette is $42 but i do think it's worth it as always i do want to just claim that makeup is a personal game something may work for you and it may not work for me makeup is all about a personal experience and please don't judge me on mine so that's it guys please let me know what you think of the kylie jenner burgundy valid down below in the comments don't forget to follow me on Twitter Instagram Facebook and snapchat that all is making tutorials if you

hey guys so today I'm doing this fall vibes makeup tutorial I'm doing these very clean flirty warm-toned eyes but still very clean and easy and simplistic to do with the pressure on clean and simplistic because people have been demanding it from me and then of course I needed my touch of glam so I a dish that highlighter and glossy bronze metallic red lips yummy i am seriously obsessed with this look I think it screams ball i think it is so sexy and seductive and clean and simplistic and easy and you know that any forever do if you like to know how to get this look right here then please keep watching alright so the first thing I want to do for this fall Vybz makeup look is sort of prime not really going to apply a primer because I'm just filming this and then I'm taking it off and i'm going to sleep and then i'm going to the airport and going in with the touch of dewy skin missed and just going to spray and and soak up the moisture I'm gonna go in with the air flash foundation by dior and I am in the color 00 now little side note this is the last time I'm giving this a shot I've tried this numerous amount of times and every time I tried it I absolutely hated it so I'm giving it one more shot and if I hated after this it's going to be no God oh it's gonna be one I don't care it's gonna be one so what I did in the past was kind of keep it at a distance and then spray myself and it would end up everywhere my shirt my hairline my nose hair browse ears teeth everywhere so not today today going to keep it very close to my actual face and tried to try and make this work what the brush on a blended in and hope for the best that are ready is one of the best tries its ever had on my face usually it would just go everywhere and not cover anything i would have to go layer upon layer upon layer right now that's a pretty damn girl i mean so many people love this foundation they're like it's my holy grill it makes my skin look at best it has amazing coverage and every time people would say that I'd be like fish well so what a lot of my friends do is use this as a base foundation and then go in with a classic foundation over top in areas that you needed so maybe I'm gonna have to get that shot because so far no no God no i'm not going to go in with my classic Foundation which is two-faced born this way and picking up a little bit more on my brush and in areas where i always prefer a little bit more coverage i'm going to apply that right on top of top of cheekbones just a thin layer which we all know is a lie because I don't work in layers can I just say this day is full of surprises or ready i use the air flash foundation because i always need it i wanted to give it one last shot same goes for this brush this is the morphe and

go in with painkiller the perfect soft definition crease color and really softly I'm going to carve my crease out with this and nothing too harsh for intense but I just like my eyes a whole lot better when I have at least a little bit of definition in that crease because if I don't do that is like a sack of I skin so I always need that tiny bit of definition to just push that crease in a tiny bit to make me feel good now cleaning the lit up using some more IV happening over to the morphine nine and blush palette and using these colors to define my lower lash light [Music] quickly applying

beautifully when i apply this as a primer and just my face radiates and it like it it just it it's amazing now for an extra kick of moisture I'm gonna go in with the tachi luminous dewy skin missed

foundation in $YEAR . 5 and together this is like which means are made up and with my morphe beauty sponge and just been a pat and dab onto my face i just love this plunge so much it has the ability to make the foundation go on so naturally and soft and light but it also has the ability to build it up in such a beautiful natural manner I swear to God ever since I kind of switched over to this sponge only as opposed to the original Beauty Blender my face has looked so much more natural because it just transforms it into a phase tune dream for concealer and now they're all time favorite shape tape by tart honey cake it on and then same sponge running going to blend that into the skin then same sponge nars soft velvet loose powder and snow and baking the under eye area alright and now with my morphe and 444 and my giorgio armani luminous still powder i'm just going to set the rest of this space the first part is i'm going to go in with as always is my max soft ochre Paint Pot and priming my eyes from lash line two brow-bone as a transition color going to be taking the power of makeup eyeshadow palette and going in with i will always love you blush and painkiller eyeshadow and with a soft blending brush I'm going to define my crease just a tiny bit and then also this is going to be perfect as a transition shade and get the perfect blend now going to go in with the black milk gelato which is a gel eyeliner by Beauty bakery and going to use this as a base on my lid on the center of building i'm not gonna pie mystic hour and i'm putting mystic our over top of a black base because I wanted to be a little bit more mysterious and smoky and on the inner and outer corners i'm applying wham bam and if you haven't tried when them over top of the blackberries yet highly suggest you doing it because we'll make it pop like crazy now with a Cosette s 85 brush I'm going to slightly diffuse the edges then going back in with mistake our industry intensifying and also blending the edges right here we get all very cohesive and mom for my lower lashline I'm gonna smoke out using makeup and chill and applying the chocolate silly bronzer on the inner corner of the lower lash line and I'm going to blind my inner corners using the Catrice glam fusion eyeshadow and wait for it wait for it Jon Snow's favorite and then now the fun part we've all been waiting for I'm gonna go in with my glitter and today i'll be using the mac transparent eel reflex make it stick for some lit clearly with glitter base just a very very thin layer and then let's get crazy oh I want to feel bathtub with the stuff and dunk my body in it right now to seal the deal i'm going to apply some falsies and today i'll be using my trusty Lily lashes in NYC alright we got these smoky mermaids swimming on our eyeballs but now it's time to snatch the face so first things first I'm going to contour my cheekbones because we are in need of some snatching this right now I'm gonna give you a pot with today I'm not going to contour using my morphe m530 this is my baby this is my everything but sometimes you gotta change it up a little bit today I'm gonna go in with this newest Sigma powder sweep f06 brush now I think this is meant to brush away baking or whatever you want with it but i think this is insane to contour with like insane and of course as always going to contour using my camera quantum medium sculpting powder so i'm going to pick up some on the brush and tap tap and I don't know how this brush does it but it has enough sturdiness and like denseness to it that it can really really like really accurately snatch that contour for you but then it also has this like flimsiness and softness to it to just effortlessly blend and define its it's insane this brush has been doing for me lately it's all I conduit they leave it is like now I just still going with my m4 44 by $OPERAND more feet with my face powder and clean up underneath around it and at the base same old same old I will always do this to make sure that my contour looks flow now I feel like we need a little bit of bronzer on our face today so I'm gonna go in with the chocolate soleil bronzer from the power of make a pallet and at first it's going to warm up my hairline very slightly because if I do this too much I look muddy and disgusting and then also just right at the contour to warm it up and diffuse it out and give yourself that tan and the very quickly without paying too much attention to it i'm going to contour my nose just a tiny bit using light sculpting powder by kevin kline [Music] [Music] just quick and easy just like that going to go in with a lady slipper or a powder which looks like this and my morphe and 09 brush and I'm just going to pick up at any minute and really softly I'm gonna add a tiny teeny bit of color just very minimal she said she applied 10 pounds of blush lived and never highlighter and then i use a new favorite this is citrine powder highlighter buy UA now citrine sold out like in a day but i will tell you that the darker one topaz is almost the same the only difference is that with topaz the base is just a tad bit warmer but citrine is the one that stole my heart so I'm going to use that today and i'm going to blind like a moment and then with this am also going to highlight my cubed bow and then with the tip of my ring finger I'm gonna pick up a little bit more and i'm going to highlight the tip of the bridge right right so when I was in Paris with issue way I wanted a super beautiful new lip but I wanted to give it like a twist so I went in with buff lip cream one of my all-time favorites because it's such a beautiful nude liquid lipstick that works i'm going to be a pine bluff first and now for that fun twist

favorite moisturizers and I'm gonna pick it up on that beauty blender and with this i'm going to moisturize my skin and what this will do is of course this will prep your face for foundation to make everything going smoothly and beautifully I'm just the way you want it but also because you're applying that foundation with your Beautyblender your Beautyblender will absorb some of that moisturizer and then once you start using it for your foundation it's going to mix in and create this lovely blend of a nourishing foundation and that will make your foundation go in even more beautiful it will just melt into the skin so nicely one of my favorite tricks to just transform a foundation into Photoshop skin for foundation today I'm going to go in with Too Faced Born This Way and i always use the color snow and pearl I mix them together to get the perfect match with that same beautiful understood dabbing it onto the skin yeah for concealer today i'll be going in with the tart shaped concealer in fair and to make it even lighter and go in with Kat Von D's a cream concealer in white out the heart really going to highlight with this is rach assistance is a very glam look and the whiteout just mixed into the tart one just dotting it in and same Beauty Blender and we're going to bounce that in I using mine are soft velvet loose powder and snow i'm going to bake my under eye area as always the first thing i'll be doing is the priming my eyelids using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot and using Ivy I'm gonna set my brow bone to crease area to help lending later on with the two-faced sketch marker in black which is included in the kid first going to map out the outer shape of the eye from there with a precise angle brush and picking up the dark black from the palette called wanted and just shaping out that outer corner and filling the outer third in with that same brush and same color picking up some makeup and chill and with this I'm gonna blend from the black onto the lid and this is going mainly on the center of the lid blending in with that black now picking up painkiller and learning that right next to make up and chill going back in with ivy and really highlighting the inner third and inner corners now going to pick up makeup and chill and i'm going to create a new crease and make sure you have a little bit of room for some glitter with painkiller and make a potential and a fine liner brush I'm going to blow and blend that out even more and because it's such a small area and it can be a little tricky to blend it out would I like to do is place up eyeliner brush laughs onto my skin and with short strokes kind of drag it up to create a blend you can always go back in with makeup and chill only Andrea intensified the base of that new crease as a base for the glitter and to make the glitter go on even sparkly er I'm gonna grab Urban Decay's heavy metal glitter in glam rock and this is going right in between those two lines and quickly setting it with the glitter from the kit with the sketch mark liner and creating a basic wing for the bottom i'm taking makeup and chill and buffing it on the outer corners of my lower lashline and with painkiller I'm just continuing defining my lower lashline some what I call on the waterline and with the white liner i'm placing a little white dot on the inner corners of my eyes and to finish the look off i'm going to do is apply some lashes that these are goddess lashes by Coco lashes alright for cheeks the first going to cut them using my camera quan medium sculpting powder and with a delay 140 brush and just gonna intensify the base of that contour and lend it out and then grab your face powder in your face brush and go right underneath to clean the line or rounded and even right over top of the base of the contour to soften it that will give you really airbrushed perfect contour finish for blush I'm going to go into my power of make a pallet and mixing both blushes for a beautiful pinky coral and

today I'm doing a tutorial inspired by harley quinn from the new movie Suicide Squad but I wanted this look to almost be as if Harley was doing some researching online for a night out and she looked up her favorite makeup tutorials so this is harley quinn but glam it is the city today I'm here to do a zendaya inspired makeup tutorial is India always slays the makeup game but when i saw this look on Instagram and everyone started bombarding me with requests I was like okay I'm doing this I'm doing this I'm doing this but before i start i want to thank each and every one of you because my channel hit four million subscribers and I'm going to keep it short and sassy because if i if i go into it too much i will cry but I love you so much you mean the world to me and for the four million is a huge well to a gun stuff now I love you so much i love you i don't wanna cry so when I was planning this look I was like I want to make sure that i pronounced as india right so I search for how to pronounce india and so my mind said was like waiting for someone to properly tell me how to pronounce india so I go to youtube this is the first video i click in our hear things sorted oracle sortie oracle already door so i told everyone at my snapchat about this and people died and this channel right here is the bomb so this channel right here is called pronunciationmanual my favorite one is zucchini all right I'm done if you want to know how to get this is or need or goal its entire makeup tutorial right here then keeping watch beeping the first thing i'll be doing is priming my face I'll be going in with the Knicks Hydra touch primer and Kim Tae raised about this all the time so I'm going to try it out today distributed all over run it but doesn't look like a really nice tacky base to work with so I'm ready for foundation for foundation today i'll be using the girl and time proof foundation in the number to base Claire and I thought why not change it up for once I'm not going to use my beauty blender and then we use the brush it's been forever since i use a brush for my foundation and i'm going to use the morphe g36 brush all right then got that makes the foundation go on beautifully I was a little skeptical at first with having used a brush for condition forever again it looks good it's faster than a Beauty Blender - so I'm liking this and everybody like this more if you want i did in my first time trying it so I didn't know what to expect but it it's good i'm really excited about that but my base is a little bit too dark so I'm going to lighten it up with a little bit of concealer and by a little bit i mean a lot so the concealers that we go in with today are the urban decay naked skin concealer in fair neutral and amazing cosmetics amazing concealer so going in with amazing cosmetics amazing concealer first I am yeah all right never mind about the Urban Decay concealer I'm keeping it at the amazing concealer only and in my opinion nothing once concealer in like a Beauty Blender so for concealer i am using the Beauty Blender yeah yeah and with a loose powder I'm going to step my under eye area to prevent it from creasing and now grabbing my Armani luminous silk powder and my morphe m 4 44 and setting the rest of my face yeah and then for larger areas of my face and then switch over to the morphe be 54 which I know the classic ii collection by morphy is discontinued they're no longer available but i also know they just came out with a brand-new line the early to collection which is basically the same brushes but better and i have yet to receive them i did order couple and once i have them i'll let you know what I think of it on snapchat and right here but for now i'm using my trusty old C 50 people and to highlight my under eye area and to brush away the baking going in with Max shivering white studio fix powder and i'm going to use a more fiji 35 to use this and I know these are hard to get by I personally got mine off of ebay because they couldn't find them in the stores anymore but maybe they're just so that and we'll come back but i don't know i don't and the best part about this is that it looks absolutely horrendous right now but once you do your contour blush highlight everything it will all just kind of melt in with each other and it will just look for eyes the first thing i'll be doing is applying a base of course to keep this eye on all day long and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot from this a little trick to make blending easier is applying a lighter matte eyeshadow from creasing brow bone area and this will just help lend anything you put over top so much so I'm doing that right now with a matte black eyeshadow first gonna wing out my lid and for this amusing morphy m1 6116 brush go ahead and fill that in and now we have a nice direction to go with for the rest of the lid to cut the little using the mac pro longwear concealer and a sigma l 05 brush and with this we're going to create our lid shape on the inner third i'm going to set that using Color rain Malibu eyeshadow and of course you want to stay inside that cut lip line yeah and on the center of the village this danessa Marik's metals pigment in sequin yeah yeah yeah not going to grab the more few 35p palette and taking this color right here and with a cara de 22 brush I'm going to cut right above that line to create a new crease and then now with a small little more fee fi 15 brush on a bus and blend that out and I know I say this all the time but the higher you get up the less pressure you want to put on the brush to make a beautiful blend you can always go in with a large brush to soften the edges and make it seamless on the water line will be upon these two for our contour inner rim gel liner in black and going back in with my morphe 35p palin and going into these two colors right here for the lower lash line using a sigma e 05 brush to apply it and then right at the outer corners you want to wing that purple out parallel to the wing and with Anasazi Beverly Hills pink heart i'm going to highlight my inner corners and also highlighting the brow bone for lashes today i'll be using the lily lashes in the style goddess all right let's move on to cheeks were cheating on a contra first because India is like sculpting to Collins I'm gonna go in with my makeup geek a breakup cool toned I'm gonna go in with my makeup geek a breakup cool toned contouring powder and my morphe and 5 30 all right for blush I've been dying to show you this on camera i've already used it like so much on a day-to-day basis plus on the snap tutorial i did last week but it's finally time to show you this precious beauty here on camera here on YouTube for blush I'm gonna use the morphine nine and blush palette now this right here is this blush palette is so gorgeous it contains all my favorite blush colors I really love the peachy war me sexy bronzy blush colors and this is it right here all in one pallet plus it's super affordable and i'm going to go in with this one we're here and this one right here and apply it using a more p.m. 509 brush it is super super pigmented so a little bit goes a long way trust me on this one so you definitely want to use a light hand because if you go too strongly you're gonna have a lot of clowns running for their money but hey I look like a car right now i love it i love my k-cup so who cares now what I'm even more excited about to show you on camera - I already talked about this in my June hits in the God knows but I've never shown you like in a video how it goes on to the face again I did show you in my snap tutorial last week but here we go this is my artist Couture diamond glow powder in cocoa bling when I tell you this is making all my favorite highlighters run for their life it's true it's open opening the magic pot up that part up and i'll be applying it today is my morphe m310 this makes your cheekbones look like wet glass like sexy wet glass you know what I never knew that in my life I wanted to have sexy wet glass cheekbones but honey now that i have them i will go over the bridge of the nose and the 2i means India's cheeks look like a magical shining aura of light so i think we pretty much know that today all right for lips it's actually really easy just want a very neutral softly glossy lip so whenever I hear that I'm like okay we need something neutral effect extreme gloss but somehow my brains transformed the word neutral and stuffed into extreme and out there so for lipstick today I'm going to go in with my tongue forward and new to vanilla lipstick because it's a beautiful nude after a gloss over talking to go in with this beautiful shape right here this is by you wait it's a lip topper and the color skinny dip something I've never done in my life for sure and all you want to do now to lock it all in place and get rid of a super cakey and powdery look is set your face with a setting spray and i'm going to go in with the make up for ever miss and fix and something super random i found out is as opposed to like spring your face like straight on like what you want to do is kind of tell your face and come with the spray from up top and that way this story will kind of fall down on tree is it just it works better it makes me feel better so I'm going to do it and that

hair at one point I even felt like it accentuated my nose hair so you know the first you want to give it a shake and then now I'm going to spray it onto my morphe Beauty Blender this is my first time trying it out so let's see how it goes then apply and this will give you a very minimum weight of foundation on your face but it's still nicely balances it out see how that's super lightweight and totally doesn't cover anything at all who am i I'm not like this anymore well it is beautiful if you want to go for a really light coverage barely there makeup look this to me for here bomb ok now in areas where you think you needed you can go in with a more coverage foundation i'm going to go for the tongue ford my first time trying it this is the top four traceless foundation stick now for me personally jawline tops of my cheekbones alright so switching back to a Beauty Blender to see if I notice a difference and bouncing that traceless foundation stick my tongue forward into my skin I don't know guys I think it's pretty damn identical as far as what the sponge is due to my foundation or concealer going to go in with the colour-pop sculpting sticks in gummy bear and mix it with tart shape tape concealer in fair yeah with this we're going to give ourselves a very highlighted glow from within look yeah and now with my NARS powder and snow i'm going to bake the under eye area all right and that just that the rest of my face then give it a really cool air brushed finish I'm going to go into my Chanel whose powder in clare in my morphe to brush and I learned this technique from alyssa ashley here on youtube and just pick up a lot of powder really pounded on the face and then brush away the excessive amounts of powder and you're left with like airbrushed flawless skin just like Kendall yeah and since I'm so fair i want to highlight my under eye area so after going with straight of white and this is the mac studio fix pastel in shivering white and i'm gonna apply that to my under eye area with my morphe e49 and with this you also brush away the baked and you're left with beautiful highlighted under eyes that look crazy right now but in the end once you have your

going to be honest I was like a lot of red but then when it finally started playing with it i am in love with you I think the modern renaissance palace by Anasazi Beverly Hills is really really cool it has a bunch of warm red homes and warm Browns but its overseas highly can do so many looks with this so today i went for the super glam red smokey eyes with the pink touch and some glitter some humongous false lashes and metallic lips because I'm all about the metallic - lately because also in this video i'll be using a lot of new products some products I've never used on camera before but if love before and some products I've never tried so this video is going to be a wind of fresh air with new products on camera so i cannot wait to show you how i did this and if you want to know how I did this and keep watching alright so throughout today video i'll be trying a lot of new products and I'm so excited to share with you my first impressions so the first product i'm going to go in with is by benefit this right here is the total moisture facial cream this is my first time applying this on camera i've been using this for about two weeks now a real life and i'm really enjoying what it's doing for my face before applying makeup I wouldn't really use it as a moisturizer for my skin care but I do think it moisturizes the skin perfectly for makeup so i really like it for makeup moisturizing information today I'm going to go in with this girl and why and this is called to New the public's you on which is a high friends think that's what he called time proof foundation ultimate lasting perfection think I got the color to which I feel like this will be a little bit to turn out a little bit this will be too dark for me we're going to mix it with a lighter foundation something very new for me mmm this right here is an artiste brush and we all recognize our toothbrushes because they look like little like one of those showerheads and this right here is the fool went at overall number eight and i'm just going to pick up some of the foundation on the brush and with this you're just going to foundation phase up and that's where using the RTS brushes for your foundation is one of the fastest ways of doing your foundation because you literally just brush it on and the brush does all the work for you and what I find so amazing about these brushes is that they really give you the most coverage you could wish for in your foundation other brushes are like a Beauty Blender you get a lot of coverage but sometimes you feel like the brush or the product you're using to apply your foundation with it kind of takes away the pigmentation and coverage that the Foundation provides with this it just keeps the ultimate amount of coverage in the brush and you're just smear and apply it on and it does the work for you it's it's amazing for concealer i'll be trying two new ones today the first one is going to be x amazing cosmetics and this right here is the amazing concealer in ivory and then also the brand new heart shaped tape contour concealer in fair and then mix it to first going in with the amazing concealer on the inner part of my under eye that's why i love that print that appreciates us tasty ghosts out there and the tar concealer right here on the tops of my cheekbones and to blend it and i'll be using my new more feet beauty sponge I have no idea what this is called it the black one and I'm wondering actually knew sponges other than the beauty blenders always kind of scare me because the Beauty Blender is the only one that is like so soft and blend the concealer in like perfection so any other sponge kind of scares me because usually they're harder and more rough and they kind of take a way foundation and we like patches and holes in your base but so far this morphy one looks looks really good a moment of truth under eye area ok just looking beautiful so far to make i'll be using mine arse powder in snow and again I'm kind of afraid because with the beautiful you have like a nice tip to go underneath your eyes with the loot ok so not gonna lie really impressed with this it is harder to go underneath the eyes with this so i might not use it for powder but so far it's it's really nice now with a loose powder and my morphe e51 brush I'm going to try the alyssa ashley technique she picks up way too much powder douses it all over the face and busted in and then wife's i'll be excessive powder away so too much powder too much notes are roughing it in and that is how she sets the face to blend in my under eye area i'm going to go into the max shivering white powder and with this i'm just going to brush away the baked and highlight my under eye area the first thing i'll be doing as always is priming my eyes using this camp up by Mac called soft ochre with more face porcelain eyeshadow on the set my crease the brow bone area to help lending later on and doing so using a mac 252 brush let's dive into the Anasazi Beverly Hills modern renaissance hello I'm going to go in with the color bond fresco first and with a more fiemme 04 brush I'm just gently applying that to the crease and slow and steady start adding more layers of fun fresco to create more depth you can always go back in with porcelain by morphy and that mac 252 brush and clean up the shape and the blending if you've gone too far up or you're just not feeling what are you seeing this is kind of your eraser all right now going into this beautiful color right here called Venetian red and with my favorite lower lashline brush this one is by morphy I talked about this and snapchat this is the end 508 this is perfect to pack on color on the lower lash line from the palette i went in with red ochre and i'm using back here on the outer corner to meet in that crease and then with a little more fee fi 14 i'm just going to blend and both that in the outer corners now going in with a small synthetic angled brush and creating a new inner corner on the lower lash line to cut the lid I'm not going in with the mac pro longwear concealer in NC 15 and this is like cutting the crease but we already put a crease in so by cutting the lid you mimic a cut crease and to cut the lid of using a sigma lip lo5 brush overtop i'll be applying for mirror of course you want to stay inside that cut lip line on the center of the little be applying this is you a pink pearl powder eyeshadow and on the inner third of the live i'll be applying the steel a metallic rose quartz quickly highlighting my inner corners using porcelain by morphy again all right and on the waterline this the for our colorful eyeshadow and liner in white all right all that is left to do now is the play some beautiful gorgeous lashes these are my new bouncing called Bella and they're my new obsession they are so full so fluffy so amazing is so we've just modern renaissance to our eyes it's time to modern renaissance are cheekbones the first thing i'm going to do is contoured this is already on my face because I didn't realize I wasn't filming yet i'm using break up by makeup geek on a more feet and 5 30 brush and I'm just going to mimic what I was doing ok so what I did was I just swooped break up right here in the hollows of my cheek data that cut and then with my zoeva 140 brush I picked up a little bit more of break up a contour powder by makeup geek and I focus on the base right here and then if you do that if you focus on that base there and then go in with a face powder and clean up underneath at the edges and even on top of the country itself you have so late your contour I just told everyone that but I want the recording all right and then for blush i already put a little bit on i'm using the new makeup geek blush in hard throw babe i love this color so much it just matches these eyes perfectly so i'm also going to warm up my face a little bit more with the blush by rushing at my forehead yes people it's the thing and a little bit on the chin area to highlight today I'm going to go in with the pattern or graph hilar this is the pinky of the to this is the paragraph labs areas and pink 003 pigment highlighter now I know this isn't really going to boom everyone's eyes so I'm going to use this as a base highlight and then lighten it up after see how that has a really nice pink reflective it's for my personal taste it's not blinding enough but like if you're like into like not blinding people with their highlight then this is perfect for you cool you guys I'm going to say something I'm not as in love with these as I hoped I would all right with my sleek sources paulo and pick up the lightest shade and just blowing up that highlight a tiny bit more and that's the shine of looking for then let's not forget about

the foundation and I also make it is because it comes with a doe foot applicator which I like because you can evenly distribute the product all over the anyways let's get your plan so I'm just going to distribute some unto my face and buy some money enough for me I'm gonna blending using my Beauty Blender and you definitely want to tap the foundation in to get the most coverage but just look how much it covers any redness and flaws but still looks like natural skin another reason why i really like this one is because it stays on like a dream I wear this to an event in Dubai and it lasted for the entire day and didn't have to touch up it just looked perfectly flawless all day long and just people can we shut up to clinic for actually having a color light enough for my pasty Whiteface not a lot of brands have that option and the point five breeze color is amazing it's an exact match all right i'm loving this finish it's time for concealer for concealer today I'm gonna make a mixture with my bye-bye on your eye by a cosmetics and light and this new product for me this is by sephora and it's called the smoothing and brightening concealer and this is in the color Clara light one so

first thing we're going to do four eyes is a pie base to keep this look on all day throughout that entire concert and I'm gonna go for max after great pain pot and to apply them using is Sigma 3 HD precision brush from the morphe 35o all mac palin going to take the lightest lightest shade and with a mac - 50 - I'm just going to set everything from my brow bone to crease with that color to help lending later on for the crystal be taking this color right here and mixing it with this one and with my morphe and 5 11 i'm just going to apply that to the crease softly now hopping over to the

stand for the liner i'm going with my ardency Inn punker rock on liquid liner to create my outline and from the tip bring it back to the lash line and then connect the inner corner to the rest of the wing now going to feel everything in using line a sleigh is Sigma into color legend ok now we're going to create a new inner corner so extended with that same liquid liner and then I like taking my Oprah fix on eyeliner gel in black to really get that inner corner there all right now let's focus on the yellow and then go in with my yellow submarine six light eyeliners on my old friend I'm going to place it right underneath that you in a corner and then drag it out and that will be the yellow so with a Smith - 12:00 brush first laying down that eyeliner gel and then quickly right after said

eyeshadow and i'm using well cosmetics neon and also dragging it out now with the black liner we're going to trace underneath the yellow to create an all-new I shape leaving the tiny room in between and only go in about this far yeah and then for the outer corner kind of pull it out straight and then going in with a warm brown and smudging this out slightly all right we finally reached our end destination as far as the I department goes it's not time for lashes I'm going to go in with the velocity lashes in Abu Dhabi and these are so amazing and yet so I'm gonna probably freak out all right

intense but not like oh my god contour where you going with that girl it's it's a girl where you go with a beautiful contour you know what to say and you can always go back in with your m44 for brush my morphe that still has your face powder in it and clean up underneath and can attempt at the edges to stuff it in and look for Less going to use a sigma or a powder this is in the color coeur de rose that and it's a very warm salty goodness for the cheeks so I'm going to use my cuz that number to brush to apply it and chest at some life to this cheeks and then a little trick I've been doing lately is grabbing the blush and also playing it softly on to the chin and I feel like that just adds a little bit more warmth to the face whereas if you don't do it it's just like no cheeks no so much life in the rest of the place is kind of dead like having a step for highlighter and then we use moonstone by becca and my favorite morphy highlighting brush my morphe m310 Becky with the good

mine are soft felt that loose powder and snow like Snow White and since you don't want this foundation to go anywhere throughout the day it's a good idea to now set it with powder and my favorite brush for that is the morphe m44 for this just packs in that powder like a dream and for my under-eye cereal like using this makeup geek angled stippling brush so a combination of these two for powder is amazing and the power I used for like all three of my face is my mac studio fix in NW 15 and as we get closer underneath my eyes i mix this with the nurse powder studded baby right here on the cheeks I don't mix it with the nurse powder yet but as soon as I hit that like on your eye area I know that I should be mixing so I mix the powder on the brush underneath set and wipe away the baby and for like this spot right here like to take a smaller brush this is by sephora and it's the pro press full coverage precision kind of going on and pack the partner in there because one of my

within back to 52 i'm just going to start highlighting my brow and then dragging it down so really apply this from brow bone to crease and this will make blending later on extremely easier for the crease of mixing this color right here with charmed I'm sure and doing that softly using a mac 224 brush you want to go all the way to words the inner cruise with this color because it's going to be dramatic and evil and smoky so we really want to make an impact here by going all the way to that inner corner here and also focus on really wanting it onto the outer corner here and smoking it up and out I guess that you want this to be super dramatic so don't be afraid go out make that way and I keep telling you guys the further you go up the less pressure you want to put on that brush the softer you apply that shadow once you go higher up the nicer the blend you can you can like really stamp it in here at the base of the crease with the higher you go up soft pressure for a really nice applying lino like going back in with that - 52 and white peach and really clean up underneath tape is unnecessary all you need is in highlight color and brush and clean it up and also let's say you feel like oh my god just tested some of the eyeshadow and I tasted it it's just like page it's amazing you feel like you're blending it a little bit off key you can always go back in with the brush

with means the wave a 240 and gold mine I'm going to blast those inner corners with gold not to finish off all you want to do is apply some natural falsies and these are the are dealt with ok since

lightest two shades they self yeah yeah that make sure both oh just look at the gym run and then with the morphe and 44444 all the fours you can kind of soften it and clean up the line underneath them

applying it using my Sigma 3d HD precision brush now i'm going to set my Christian brow bone area using a lighter not shade and this will really help blending later on with makeup geek americano eyeshadow i'll be cutting my crease and for this it's best to look straight ahead in a mirror and just place your crease a tiny tad bit above your natural crease like I did here it's just right above it and then just follow through by following the natural curve of your eye and then it's just a little bit more dramatic and the person using for this is a makeup studio number 22 brush now mixing americana with Barcelona beach also make up because medics and with my Cosette p 365 brush i'm just going to start blending that crease that a little bit more you want to remember to never go below this line to start to speak this is your new crease and we're not going to put anything below your new crease because everything below your new crease is for that beautiful gold now with my Cosette d 2 20 and Barcelona beach only I start blending even more yeah and then with my zoeva - 20 brush and that same color we apply them the crease and brow bone you can kind of use it as an eraser for the goal i'm going to go in with this amazing metal pigment by danessa Marik's and it's in the color Pharaoh and as my mixing medium today to really make it stick i'll be using the Bionic gel activator by Bionic beauty so first I apply a layer of bed gel that's a base and remember with this you can also really clean up the line underneath the cut crease because someone that pigment up and Pat it on top

contouring on today I'll be contouring used to make Kevin a quan medium sculpting powder and my morphe and 5 30 brush and remember this is a draft tutorial but if you want to wear this as a woman please make the contour as intense and stark as you want and I'm thinking going to go a little bit more extreme today yeah yeah but i'm also going to do a tiny bit of nose contouring and by tiny I mean a lot now as you can see this is way too intense so a trick is to grab a bigger brush and your face powder and just glided over top to stop and the harshness of it and this will also blended down it's still has a defining moment now but it's less harsh this is a trick I picked up from the same and it's amazing and that's to make it even more intense what you can do is pick your Beautyblender up with some powder and on top of the edge of the contour line you created you want to bake and this will make it even more intense but it will also clean up any shadows you don't want to brush away again and that way you have a nose contoured that remains very soft but still very effective I'm going to warm up my face using my to faith milk chocolate bronzer and light medium and my Cosette

ado if you would like to know how to get this Judy how do you make up look super sexy super smoky then keep on watching all right the first thing you want to do for this sexy delicious face is primed today I'm going to prime using the skin the Navy a priming spray and I especially love this one because it doesn't contain any silicones and silicones when you put them on the face throughout the day they get a little bit slippy and they make your makeup run off they just make up melts and this get a navy a primer spray doesn't have silicone so you do not have the problem of a sliding up throughout the day so I really like this as a primer i'm going to use it as all right for foundation you want that supermodel skin so you want your skin to be top notch amazing beautiful on fleek flee key so my goatee foundation for that is my makeup forever ultra HD foundation sticks and i'm going to use 120 on the outer perimeter of my face and 117 on the inner and now that you look like an art piece you're going to take your really blender and blend it in for concealer going to use the Kevin upon central skin enhancer in sx o 1 and make it a little bit lighter using my Carlin TV pin stick in double zero and I'm quickly going to set and bake using the NARS soft velvet loose powder in snow i'm priming my eyelids using software could paint pot by mac with Max vanilla eyeshadow on a set my crease the brow bone area to help blending later on I'm going to apply almost as a Beverly Hills dusty rose eyeshadow to my crease to give that nice blowout transition color and furthest am using a mac 224 brush and unlike usual I now start on the inner crease because it's a grungy supermodel look and models can get away with everything so we're going to really smoke up that inner crease together that really grungy feel and to give it that nice the blowout affect the higher you come into your crease the less pressure you want to apply to your brush so up here I'm verily touching my skin course we also need some definition on the outer corner so just start swirling and blending that in and again the higher you come into that crease the less pressure on your brush once I've got most of the Colorado like taking that brush really lightly barely touching the skin and going back and forth to really give it a nice gradient from makeup geek Manny palette I'm taking this color right here and mixing it with the red and with these a wave up to 34 that is going on the lid as my base color now going to take insomnia and going to use this to darken and smoke everything out and also mention that a little bit with the red color which is called Mars to give everything a little bit more of an orange you feel going to take the middle color which is called sora and really lightly with a morphy mb 23 I'm just blending that in not going to take this color again but this time I'm going to reapply to the lid with a damp brush and going back in with the darker colors to blend everything nicely for the lower lash i'm going to smoke it out using these three colors right here and putting the color down using a so wave a 240 brush and also all the way to the inner corners and smooth i'm going to use the bombs batter up in pinch-hitter on me lash line i have no idea what the name means I want to do now to finish is you some very natural falsies and i'm using the r del wispies all right for cheeks of course you want to contour because gigi hadid cheekbones ha squeak for this going to use my cabin quan sculpting powder in medium and my favorite morphe brush to

the cheeks the following the contour just a little bit of warmth also going to do a little bit coming from the hairline blending down not too much because I look muddy in 2.2 seconds when I do my forehead which sucks for blessing is the tiniest bit of sigma or powder in pet name and my cuz that number to brush and now you want to grace your face with highlighter is Gigi looked super super glowy dewy and just so i'm going to use moonstone by becca for this and my favorite brush to use that with is my morphe m310 tip of the nose Cupid's bow and the tiniest bit from the highest point of your arch up to your forehead just a tiny tiny tiny bit because there's so many powder products that can quickly look a little bit more powdery and cakey a trick to make yourself look natural natural

anthem when that camera flew by and I saw a spark of red which was her suit I already felt like that was the greatest moment of my life when I saw that spark of red I went yes Queen lady gaga killed it lady gaga was so amazing i was so proud of her and when she blinked and we all saw that beautiful glittery red lid my Twitter bombarded with tweets asking for requests and I just died i drooled a little and today I'm here to do the look for ya surprisingly enough i think this look is perfect for valentine's day or for like clubbing on Valentine's Day it's just a really cool glittery look anyways without any further ado if you would like to know how to get this lady gaga makeup look right here then keep watching alright so the first thing you want to do is prime and today I'm going from my becca backlight priming filter because i want to glow like a super bowl national anthem star for my nose and chin i need a little bit more of a prime for that i'm using the Bekaa ever Mac parlous priming perfect firm foundation today I'm going to go for a ride or die and make up for ever ultra foundation sticks because they're my favorite so I'm lasting 120 on the outer perimeter of my face and 117 on the inner and with my trusty Beauty Blender I'm going to blend it all in for concealer I'm going for the cabinet quan central skin enhancer in sx a one and lightning it a little bit using my krylon TV pin stick in 0 and again blaming that in using my Beauty Blender and i'm going to bake using mine are soft velvet loose powder in snow i'm priming my eyelids using Mac soft ochre Paint Pot work max of vanilla eyeshadow i'm just setting my crease of Robin area to get a completely met and easier to blend later on we need a little bit of transition in that crease so first i'm going in with makeup cosmetics peach smoothie and softly blending this into the crease using a mac 224 brush now for some depth of hiding Showtime also by making because medals to the lid and the crease and I'm first using this naked studio number 17 brush to lay the color down and with a Cosette d 2 20 brush I'm just softly blending it into the crease and with these a waiver to 40 brush i'm also applying it to the lower lash I know about halfway in for the inner corner i'm highlighting with a mixture of max think pink and nylon eyeshadow and applying this using the light portion of my cavity shade + light eye brush ok now comes the fun part but also the hardest part the glitter and what I did was just go a little bit above my natural crease and I did give it a little bit of a shape at the outer corner just to lift the I a little bit more a trick is when you're not doing this on camera lean forward with your face while looking down and then pack that glitter on and that way you will have the least amount of fallout as an adhesive today i'll be using the lit clearly liquid glitter base and the Glitter i'll be using it's also by lit and this is firecracker number for the first laying that bass down and going right over top with the glitter and if you feel like the glitter is not fully opaque there's this amazing pigment by illamasqua called berber and i'll use that to fill up any holes can always use a fan to dry the glitter a little bit quicker so you will not get any creases in it now all you want to do is finish off with some lashes and i'm using the hood of beauty Maryland the goggles cheeks looked very sculpted and glowy and supernatural flushed so wrong so I'm going to contract today using my cabinet one sculpting cutter in medium and my morphe and 5 30 brush

a little bit because the Urban Decay blushes are super pigmented and a sigma s 37 brush which I really love for blush lately and from the contour kind of go up to the highlight and kind of diffuse everything together but don't really come forward to the apple of the cheek because solita definitely didn't have anything they're just keep it on the side like a slob bitch look at that hole now i'm going to do to finish this off is spray my face using the skin and Naevia make a finishing spray i love this one get rid of the powder look for lips are going to use this urban decay liner in naked

fell in love with it and now they came out with a primer spray a couple of years ago and I've been trying it for like a month now and it is so so flipping although and why I love this so much is because it doesn't have any silicone and the thing is when you put silicone on your skin throughout the day silicon get slippery and that will just make your face slide and look gross and this doesn't

will soak up that spray and it will mix it with your foundation and that will keep it on longer the foundation of using today is by Makeup Forever this is the ultra HD stick foundation I tried this in minneapolis and I felt an absolute love with it this gives you such an amazing flawless coverage in such a little time and it'll it just looks photoshopped to perfect it like there's a blur on your face so I like to just go on to my face apply the stick look like a drag queen and live for it hello to me and then with your Beautyblender start tapping this into the skin and give yourself that flaw lost face I mean can we talk about the fact that my base just went from zero to a hundred real quick I'm gonna say it I love this stick foundation version more than the flu it for concealer i'll be using it cosmetics bye bye under eye a light to create the Adele love to make up she loves her follow space so for one from like you know what honey pack it on and then again with my beauty blender

crease and brow bone area and this will help blend out the brown in the crease later on a lot more now going into the urban decay Gwen Stefani palette and I'm taking the color zone and with a morphy m505 i'm just applying that to the crease to build definition then also dragging it down to the outer V and also making that nice and smoky now i'm going to grab a little bit of Anaheim and with the morphe mb 23 I'm just blending that out of the transition color now going in the tart tart lapel and taking this color right here and again using that morphy m505 and darkening the outer V increase for the lid I'm first going in with this makeup geek foiled I shadow and this is grand stand with a mac 242 i'm just applying that from lash line to crease for the inner third I'm taking another foiled a shadow make a week this one is in the spotlight with the same brush that is going on the inner third leading up to the crease and in two grants and on the inner corners i'll be applying Urban Decay polyester bride for the lower lash i'm using a Mac - 28 to apply that same dark brown color from the tartlet pellet again all you want to do now is focused on the beautiful black glitter liner that Adele were on SNL the first I'm going to go in with my captain d ink liner in trooper yeah then I feel everything in using my Sigma line ace in legend and then to add that sparkle i'm taking my Urban Decay heavy metal glitter liner in gunmetal and that's just going right over top to open up the eyes I'm of hiring fascinating i called my mac and now all you want to do to finish office supply

back is just right in the center just blended with the highlight in the contour and then now what I'm going to use is the skin to Navia make up finishing spray and this is like the final step towards keeping your makeup on all day long I love this because I love working with powders on my face i love contouring with powders putting blush on with powders and sometimes all the powders can make you

subscribe to my channel I want to thank you so much for watching i truly appreciated I love you and hopefully I will see you guys on Wednesday hey guys so today I'm doing a tutorial on the black smokey look that demi lovato was wearing in her new music video cool for the summer which in my opinion is these summer anthem of 2015 the entire music video is so sexy and I was makeup is on . and i think she's never looked better so that is the look that I'm doing for you today if you would like to know how to get this demi lovato black smokey eyes makeup look and keep watching so the first thing i'll be doing of course is priming and today i will not be going in with my aftershave balm nivea I'm actually a little bit more dry today and when I'm a little bit more dry i like going for the set of Phil and this is the hydration low shown a subscriber here on my channel recommended this to me if you have dry skin this also has glycerin as it's the second ingredient and glycerin make stuff stick to it so if you use this as your base your makeup will really stick onto the cluster in making it stay on all day so instead of my aftershave balm i'm going to use this because I'm a little bit more try just as with the aftershave balm I do like to follow through with my smashbox primer water for foundation today I'm going to go in with my born this way foundation by to face and this is in the color ivory and of course I cannot go without my dearest cojiendo on confirmation in 213 so i'll be making a mixture of these two right here and that will be my foundation and i'm applying this using my morphe e6 brush for my concealer and first going to correct so let me use my mac studio finish correct and conceal in pale pink and pale yellow and then going over top with my urban decay naked skin concealer in fair neutral and working that in with a real techniques bunch and setting that with powder to prevent everything from creasing so for the eyes the first thing you want to do is prime them of course because we're going to work with black eye shadows and that is one of the hardest looks to do and for this we're going to use my mac software paint pot and i'm applying it with a days away by 142 concealer buffer brush then to make the blending and decreased way easier and i'm going to take this Bobby Brown ivory eyeshadow and i'm setting the softer could paint pot from my crease up to my brow bone and this will just help blend all the eyeshadows that we put over top way easier as you may have noticed i still have some powder underneath my eyes and I'm doing this so that would ever dark color falls down as fallout I can brush away right after so this way you will not have any fallout at the end of the look for my crease that first going in with these two shades from the morphe 35o and palate and with a morphy m 4 12 I'm just blending that in and for a black smokey eye look it's extremely important to have a blending transition color in your crease because if you don't lending will become so harsh and so unattractive it will become so wrong so having that blending transition color in the crease will really make this look a lot more wearable and easy to do from that same palette of mixing these two colors right here and this is also going in the crease just to darken it up and with ajax beauty line number 7 brush I'm just buffing that in yeah and to really blend those edges just take that first brush you used with the first to blending shades and just wiggle back and forth between the lines and it will soften it and blend it out for Matt late i'm going to use the Tasha de known as blackest black matte eyeshadow and I'm going to pack this on using a mac 42 and with a makeup geek defined crease brush I'm just blending the edges into the brown once you're done doing the top portion you can take away all this powder and remove the fall out for a bit lower lash line and again going in with that Natasha didn't own a black is black eyeshadow and I'm just smoking the black into the roots of my lower lashes then with my Mac - 13 in a soft brown color I'm just blending and smoking that out and then for some shine on the inner corners of taking this color pop liberty is super shadow to finish off going to apply some mascara and false ease and the policies of using today are by her beauty and these are the main clashes in Naomi p yeah ok for cheeks i think it's an understatement when I say Demi was glowy and bronzy like her makeup artist went all out on the cheeks so first I'm going to warm up my skin because I definitely need a lot of bronzer to mimic her bronze venus so I'm gonna mix - I'm going to use the tart park at princess bronzer right here and then to warm it up a little bit more my give me some more light skin

going to keep it soft and follow the curves of my crease a little by little star working your way into the inner part of your crease just really smoothly and lightly blend that in take your time then

this super wearable easy to do natural makeup look that super glowy and I think very flattering plus i also included how I got this very free curly hair I really this is how the styling my hair lately yeah I have some great discount codes for you at the end of this video so make sure you please stay tuned and if you want to know how to get this then please stay tuned alright so to get myself started today I'm first going in with the dior glow maximizer and it's just an illuminating base and that is exactly what i want for this look because i want to go no no I can angel oh dear oh that's a globe now for foundation I thought really long and hard on this and this look today is more of a soft look but still I want my base to look on fleek and gotten a lot of comments that my basis sometimes too perfect but you know what I'd rather have my base looking perfect then not so perfect so today I'm going to make a mixture of my benefit hello flawless foundation in pure for sure ivory and just to give it a little bit more fish I'm going to take the cross island TV pin sick in g 191 so first i'm going in with the benefit foundation and then wherever I need more i apply the cryo and TV paint stick there now go ahead and highlight today I'm going to use my mac pro longwear in NC 15 and my crew on TV pin stick in 4062 highlights but if you feel like a lot of foundation + concealer is too much for you then by all means skip that do you you do you I'm going to do me and now quickly setting everything with powder so it will increase so now i'm going to quickly do my brows and one I off camera and that it will be back okay so four eyes were going to keep this very easy quick and simple and silly little glamorous and last year so it's always the first thing I'm doing is priming my eyelids to prevent any creasing from happening and for this I'm using my software group in part by Mac them from my tartare lapel and i'm going to take this color right here and I'm applying the shade of right into my crease and up to my brow bone and what this will do is it will help blend out the crease color that will place on later it will help let those out easier and smoother so from the same palette i'm going to go into wonderer and with this i'm just going to start defining the outer parts of my crease a little bit more just to get more definition and depth so ride into the crease focus applying wonderer and bring it in about half way in now my eye shape greatly benefits from a rounded outer corner but if your eyes benefit from a v-shaped outer corner by all means do that so I'm going to drag the brown on to my outer corner and rounded out then picking up a little bit more of wonder on a big blending brush we're just going to diffuse and blend out this define - because it's definitely way too harsh now and we wanted to be soft and hazy for the living room using color pops XO super shock shadow and for some extra glam over top i'm applying the the bomb overshadow whatever in and no money no honey it's a pigment and right over top XO just for some extra glam and shine I don't wanna go too far with the lower lash line so again taking that crease color and really slightly defining the roots of my lower lashes and then to open up the eyes and devise a wide awake feel I'm taking my bed nine neutralizer cream crayon and that is going on the waterline all right to finish up the eyes all you need is some mascara on your top lashes only if you prefer mascara on your bottom lashes also that by all means go ahead and do that I find that my eyes look more natural without anything on the lower lashes so going to do that and falsies I wanted to be super lash e so i'm going to go with the siren lashes by house of lashes to give the I a fun and unique look I'm going to take a little bit of black eyeshadow and a really tiny tiny TV brush I'm going to place that right here where the lash stops right next to the roots of my lower lashes to the inner . of my eye so to speak and then once i reach that inner corner I drag it out a little bit as if you would do an inner corner cat . like with the Arabian style smokey eyes and then just leave that line there and it just makes your eyes look so cat-like and defined and i really like this for cheeks today I want to keep it soft glowy and very flushed so first going to contract just a tiny teeny bit using heroin eyeshadow by illamasqua there's a warm of my complexion a little bit i'm taking my macro find golden bronzer or blush today I'm using bobby brown's pink coral just to give that flesh that pop of cheek and for a highlighter of course better shimmering skin Perfector press two moons and let's go glowy up in heel for lips the first using Mac's a little pencil in boldly bear just to give myself a little bit more depth and volume and then for the lip gloss and making a mixture with honest as a perfectly hills lip gloss the new lip gloss is amusing - I'm using a dainty and undressed and together this is like the perfect nude gloss it's so everything so I'm putting dainty on my top lip and undressed on the lower lip and then to mix them all you want to do is smack them lips together girl and that concludes the makeup now on to the hair so for my hair today I'm using the new new me tighten three curling iron set it comes with three curling wands and this is the medium one this is the small of course we got our big one so it comes to three wines and today I'm going to start off by using the medium sized curling wand I actually used it to curl the hair of my model for a campaign

absolute great quality but the fact that it has a three ones it's perfect for beginners out there because you don't have to buy three separate curling irons it also comes with a heat protectant glove

Celsius degrees which is hot so again use the glove and there's a little push the button right here and that will release the wand so I'm going to go for the medium one so I'm taking the medium one and then you just click it on I thought I'm just going to go ahead and give myself some soft waves today so we're just going to part a little section of we're going to take it brush it the hand that is curling the hair around the curling wand should have the glove on it hold it like this and then I wrap the hair around and then I bring it all the way to the ends and keep it there so I'm not

the dark roots fixed next week say without any further ado if you want to know how to get this lady gaga look right here then please stay tuned all right so I already put down the base to pretend everything from creasing and now it's time to move on to the first I shadow the first I should i'll be using is caramel by an associate beverly hills and i'm applying this color on the outer crease a little bit higher up than I would usually place my crease color and this is for some transition and warmth because you get to police the on God that she had all these cool tone shades going on but then in the crash at this warmth so I'm just going to place this here and then also wing it out and of course it wouldn't be a goggle look if we didn't go all the way to the inner corners now i'm going to go into max plumage and this will be used as the winged shape so with an angled brush I'm going to create a line that is going towards the end of my eyebrow you want to go high up goggles line almost reached the end of her eyebrows so it's totally fine to go high up and go extreme with this one and then from that line go ahead and pull it back to the lid and of course fill in using that same color then I'm going to blend that out with a pencil brush using the same mac color but also mixing it with a little bit of a necessity of Beverly Hills mermaid and literally all you want to do is grab that pencil brush and diffuse the edges of the line that you just created and for now it doesn't have to be super precise on the lid but the close to you come to word the point of the eyeliner you want to keep it really tiny and need to precise so just keep lending and making it soft and diffused for the lid him first going in with this color pop super shock shadow in sugar and this bad boy is going on to the center of the lid so plumage and mermaid kind of stopped here and then from there you want to continue using sugar and then going over top with honest as a Beverly Hills I see there for me in her third and inner corners and going to take a legend also buy omnicef early Hills who's going right on that inner third and inner corners now going back into plumage by mac and then to create a more definite line so right now it's all kind of like healing and we're getting there but i want a super defined line as if it's an eyeliner going way up now for the lower lash line again taking plummet and we're running this as i said on the lower lash line but you want to connect it to that eyeliner part ride here just connected to it and then what you want to do is drag it towards the inner corners then i'm taking mermaid and I see by honestly berkeley hills again and smoking it out all right now what really made this look where the sparkles and the sparkles were all over and i love that so I'm going to take my dual effects and shine my makeup studio and I'm going to dazzle it all over the light parts of the eye and that's it for the eyeshadows i'm not going to apply some mascara do you give a base for my lashes and the lashes i'll be using our right of the lower and these are the adult meet up for the cheeks Gaga didn't really have a whole lot going on so i'm gonna do is bronze and warm of my complexion a bit using some contouring powder and bronzer the blushes and highlighters first part is i'm going to use is always is my heroine eyeshadow by illamasqua then to further warm of my complexion and taking the two-faced at milk chocolate bronzer then for blush and then use a shocker Luminoso and then to highlight my complexion i'm going to use the becca shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone using mine ours either brush after my January hits and God knows a lot of people told me that the nurse either brush is perfect for highlighting so I'm gonna give it a go to digg when bam bam bam I mean it's okay alright so what I think of it is that i have to dip into my highlighting powder a lot more with the nurse eda as opposed to my England for SS brush so so far i I'm just really not a fan of this brush I'm sorry I'm also just going to highlight the bridge of my nose tip of my nose keeps both the works that the further cheeks all right last step is the lips that you don't really want to overdraw the lips with the pence or anything you just want to New them out to get a really nice fleshy skin new tone and after that i'll be using Mac's flash pot and then you sort of what this natural flush of a gloss over top and the product that totally rang my bell for the book was the bourgeois color burst in color births it all faded off because I've had it for so long but the color is peach on the beach and it's one of those glossy bombs that just ask the tiniest bit of color it still gives the color and sheen and flush so this is going right over top and that's the guys that concludes my lady gaga grammys 2015 inspired makeup tutorial I loved it I it's so extreme yep so glam and it's so I love with it so

just going to . this mixture onto my face and I'll be buffing this in using my Sigma f80 688 baby eight so because we're doing smokey is inspired by jlo chances are that these smoky colors the dark colors will drop down onto her face and create bought a little trick it's the first year for nation then do your browse to your eyes and then once you reach the bottom portion of your eyes you first put concealer and all that on so that you will not have any cloud so what I'm going to do now is do my brows off camera and then it will be back so I already put down my base is my mac soft ochre Paint Pot and the first thing I'm going to do now is taking a light matte eyeshadow I'm taking this color by these Oh Ava smoky eyeshadow palette because it suits my skin tone a lot and in order to get this blending to be on fleek you want this blending to be perfect a little trick is to put down a net-like color all over the ice first and then whatever you put on top glides is so much easier and blends is so much easier so that's a great trick so I'm taking the light color and it's going all over my eyes from lid two brow-bone the former transition shades the colors i'll be using our by makeup geek in unexpected the shape right here and also day raised by Anasazi Beverly Hills so I'm just taking the two and tilting my brush up and then smooth this in to the crease and this is going

my eye I'm not cleaning up my under eye area by using my foundation brush and getting rid of any fallout that i may have and then now it's time to do the concealer and then we can work on the lower lash line so I'm going to really quickly pop some concealer on ok now i'm going to go back into purple rain and running all the way along my lower lash line now with a pencil brush I'm going to soften the lines and make them ultra ultra smoky because they were super smoky on JLo now going in with the tiniest bit of black and running it straight to the base of the roots of my lower lashes time to darken that water line i'm taking my our class at one point five millimeter mechanical gel liner and then JLo was also rocking this super sexy inner corner eyeliner push it was very vixeny and kidney and it was very very sexy so I'm going to take my Kevin eat a two liner in trooper and i'm going to make just a really tiny teeny . on the inner corners just to elongate the eyes and make more cat shapes and then all we want to do now is run a little bit of black eyeshadow along the routes of my top lashes so it's a complete the look all you want to do now is the PI falsies and the ones i will be using our max 36 lashes and these are perfect because on JLo you could definitely see that they are the art of corners really flared out and give that cat shaped feel again and these do that these

the cheekbones is a must Cupid's bow also a must in my humble opinion tip of the nose also a month JLo had a bridge of the news and this was a new one to me right in the middle just above the brows JLo had highlight ride here and that's that French shape so for the lips JLo word this really cool toned pinky nude color it was super super nude so we're going to mimic that but she also had a lot of volume with a lip pencils so I'm gonna make my lips look more full using the LA girl auto lip line you're in nude and a little bit of stone by Mac yeah for lipstick i'll be using the new Anasazi

Iggy Azalea and jennifer lopez which is booty and oh my gosh dead ass so much as I did I couldn't oh my god these two ladies looked super smokin hot and I was like okay i need to find someone to do a crazy smoking hot collapse with and I saw my solution in crispy throw up your hands if you love a good collaboration see that today's video is inspired by jlo super gorgeous glowing skin their JLo glow and it's a super wearable look actually and crispy did her look inspired by Iggy so absolutely don't forget to check out krispies video I love your videos she's so talented and subscribe to her and show her some love but other than that I don't have anything else let's just go right ahead to this j.lo booty look first product i'm going to use is by L'Oreal and it's the Lumia chic pure light primer and this is a really light reflecting one and you could go for the becca shimmering skin Perfector in pearl but I find that this one right here by L'Oreal has just a little bit more shine to it and that is exactly what we want today so I'm taking that and blending it in to my skin for information today I'm again taking my benefit hello flawless oxygen while brightening makeup foundation I just because it just it's a beautiful and I'm the car and pure for sure ivory at first I'm just dotting that onto my face and then i'm taking my new favorite brush this is the stigma 3d HD brush and I'm taking a little bit of Evian facial spray and I'm going to spray the brush and then with the brush to start buffing in the foundation and what that Evian facial spray is going to do is it's going to make the brush a little bit more moist and this way its blending in the foundation in a much more natural way and every time you feel like your brush is starting to become a little bit more dry again just respray it every buffin now it's time for concealer and i'm using my trusty old mac pro longwear in NC 15 and i'm taking my sigma f 86 and the Evian spray once more spray it and buffing now I'm quickly going to set my under eye area I using SI shaping powder by mac and i'm going to do browse off-camera going to do this all off camera and then we'll be back ok so now onto eyes the first thing I'm doing is applying a base to my entire eye area to prevent the eye shadows from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this next I'm going in these songs books a tude palette and I'm making a mixture with three colors because i find that these three colors combines may just the perfect crease color for this look so I'm taking a little bit of caramel toffee and cream dream and with days away that - 20 a crease brush and just lightly feathering this in my crease I want this to be really soft and diffused so once i have most of the products on I will take it up a little bit higher and higher and higher I'm taking a little bit of Max emphasize shaping powder and with this i am highlighting my brow bone and I'm also taking a big and loading it up here on the inner corners because on JLo those inner corners were so bright and so intense you really want to lay focus there for the lid on mixing emphasize partner by Mac again and was a little bit of makeup geeks bling eyeshadow and as I said this is going onto my lid leading up to the crease and all the way to be outer corners what I like to do now is take a more concentrated brush at this is by the way if i did see - 31 Lux petite crease and going back in my crease shadows and with the tips of the brush is slightly want to reapply their crease color and that will make it a little bit more concentrated as I said one of the main features of this look are those in 10 inner corners so first laying down a bit of next eyeshadow in crystal avalanche you just want to pack that on that inner corner brightening that up and blending in a sort of V shape like this then going in with the most shimmering eye shadow of life nylon nation of my mac i'm taking a little moist brush and going over top and nylon damp is just the sparkliest glow easiest shut out of life ok I'm quickly going to go over to the bottom lash line and it looks super clean on jail yet still shit definition with those lashes so a little trick is to make your lower lashes pop we don't want any eyeshadow there is taking a really small and precise eyeliner for that personally I love to use the hourglass at 1.5 mechanical gel liner in obsidian and all you want to do is place a couple of dots on the roots of your lower lashes and then once you put mascara over top it just gives it way more definition so I'm aware of the fact that it looks super crazy right now but trust me once you put the scare over top it looks fine just I mean look at this side looks fine ok now to define my upper lash line a bit i'm going in my the bomb meets mad nude eyeshadow palettes and I'm going in the collar Matt's wood and with an angled brush i'm placing this super close to the roots of my lashes and slowly start building some definition there ok so once you've got most of that on you want to take a really small brush this is the pencil brush by makeup geek and a mixing net would with met rosen and all you want to do with this is smudge out that lying and make it really soft and diffused and smoky and lived in a on the waterline I'm quickly running some been nine year twice or cream crayon in ultralight MP 0 and then to finish off and curling my lashes and applying mascara and false lashes mascara is going to be the makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra black and therefore falsies i'm using these I don't know the brand but they're called Daisy and these days he wants our supernatural and that is exactly what you want to go for because JLo have really natural ones on also so I'm just going to pop this on right now and then we'll be back now onto cheeks the first thing i'll be doing is sculpting my cheekbones to make me look a little bit more you know j.lo and as always i'm using my msg eyeshadow in heroin for this energy is go to town and sculpt create those cheekbones but Daniel wasn't wearing any blush it was more so a lot of bronzer and a lot to lot of shine and glow so I'm just going to warm up my complexion a bit more using this bronzing powder by Mac this is called refined golden you kind of want to swirl it around on the high plains of your face and give yourself that sunkissed look I'm also gonna use it as a blush a little bit because there's not going to be any blush and then for that immaculate glow I'm of course going for my bed night looks from the air powder in I because this - it's my skin tone the best and this is what's going to give me the most glowy effect of all the highlighters that I have this doesn't really suit really dark skin tones nor medium skin tones I think so the darker of us can tell you are the more golden and bronze you want to go with your highlighter so Jennifer was super glowy like everything was a glow and we're even going in with a spray later on but the key focusing . you want to focus on when highlighting with a powder for this look is first tops of the cheekbones super super importance so right here sort of next to your eye oh we're going to get the glow up in here I'm gonna go a little bit further of course i'm taking a pencil brush and I'm highlighting my nose by just drawing a line in that little scoop here and onto the bridge of my nose and then on the highest tip of your nose please a little . highlighter like so and that is going to live the tip of your nose up now what I really noticed is that there is a lot of highlighter on the Cupid's bow but also on the highest point of the forehead and then as I said you also want to do cupids bow take a little bit more and onto the highest point of your tin for me that's right here right there so I'm going to take 6 plus x mac and whenever you want super ultra glow super high do we finish fix plus and I'm quickly going in with a stippling brush and stipple this out so you get an even do we finish and then to finish of this look all you need to do is your lips so I'm going to completely blank on my lips because her lips were nude so I'm taking the hourglass lipstick in some nude

i was on the toilet this came up so I was like oh that's a fun idea but other than that let's just go i hope you enjoy alright so the first product I have in mind for the megabus tag is a product that has been so talked about that you just you just want to try a sample of it because everyone is talking about it and the products i'm talking about is our glasses and mineral veil primer I have tried it once before which was on camera wasn't the biggest fan of it them and then just with your fingers start blending this in ok there for foundation I'm going with my benefit hello flawless oxygen Wow brightening makeup foundation and I'm the color and pure for sure I brie and if you're really liking this one lately it get it just it looks beautiful on camera so I'm just going to take a bit and . it onto my skin all right and then i'm using a new foundation brush this is by Sigma this is the 3d HD kabuki foundation brush and it's where a little guy it has a triangle so i'm just going to use that to start stippling in hello flawless by benefit and holy shit this brush gives you full coverage and then with that . you can actually reach the eye is really easily oh my god alright so that is an absolutely fantastic brush i really recommend this one so for concealer I either wanted to go for AV NARS creamy concealer because I youtube is like you either use the nurse creamy concealer or use the pro longwear and I want to use Pro Longwear because it's my wish and then it's about this and i'm using my Sigma f80 six and i'm going to set my under eye area using emphasize shaping partner by Mac all right now I'm going to do browse off camera because if I did that on camera this video will become way too long but the product i'll be using for my brows are also buzzed about makeup products i will be doing my eyebrows using the Anasazi Beverly Hills brow ways and ash blonde and also the dipbrow pomade in taupe so i'll be doing my eyebrows for eyes are going to start of by priming them of course and i'm using my soft ochre Paint Pot by Mac my first eyeshadow is going to come from the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette and it's going to be the color nooner reason why i chose the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette is because it's the Urban Decay Naked 3 palette i am taking nooner and i'm going to apply it straight to the crease and first mainly focusing on this outer edge here but then once most product is on I work my way to the inner corners of my crease for the let him taking my own estas de Beverly Hills tamannah pellet and going in the color china rose and I'm applying this to the inner half of my lids and oh can you look at this color i am now going in that same palette and then taking song griha and this is going on the outer half of the lid meeting up to the crease and then I'm actually taking a blending brush with sangria and applying this to the crease to give it a little bit of that warmer color that song right has its a blended in nicer then still using the term on appellate and going in chocolate and for this look I want a fairly colorful lid and really smoky liner and underneath portion so this is going from inner to outer corner of the lower lash line and then to blend this out and give it a nice smoky feeling going back into sangria and i'm using this to soften and blend out chocolate on the lower lash line and then now it's time for the liner i'm taking my Sigma wicked standout eyes gel eyeliner to start off with and i'm going to start off with a line right here determining where I want my angle to go to from my line and then switching over to the cabin D tattoo liner in trooper this product has been talked about so so much first let's just fill in that sort of triangle we create it ok then for the inner corner for this little thing right here you want to look down and sort of pull the top line of your inner corner down from that line you go back to the the lower lash line portion and then you have a little trying to fill it in and fill up and then all we want to do is connect this corner to that line right there on the waterline am using the hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel liner in obsidian and this is one of the products that I wish is going to create some serious buzz in the community I'm really a lover of putting something right underneath the pupil of the eye so for this I'm going to use my born pretty store nail art wheel thingy majig right here and there are some seriously small gold studs in there and i'm just going to pop them right on the skin on the eye on everything ok so there's that now to

- 28 crease brush I'm just focusing this in my crease going from inner to outer corner and this is going to be our crease definition color and i absolutely love warm taupe from the Miami appellate because it gives definition but it's not too warm nor is it to cool toned it's just the perfect brown really then what days away but - 34 lux smokey shader and picking some of warm taupe up again and focusing this on the inner part of my lid sort of the inner third and blending up to the crease so that they meet and i'm also focusing it on the outer third so you leave a nice clean gap in the middle you can even focus it in the crease a little bit more to do with some definition we just want to keep that middle part bear with a fluffy brush go ahead and blend that out and soften the edges really importante so for the middle part i'm taking the UH Nastasia metallic luster liner and this is a liquid gold this is one of my favorite products at the moment so you want to look down and paint this at the middle of your lid I kind of an off-center day with the bro oh we're just going to ignore that so once you've got that in the middle you want to take a pencil brush this is x sigma and you want to diffuse the edges with the brown actually i'm going to add a little bit more Brown here because up off center and then I'm going into my Anasazi Beverly Hills taman address your face palette

also going to punch some on the inner part of my eyes to sparkle it up and open it up and make it more MORE now I'm picking up a little bit of Anasazi Beverly Hills waterproof cream color in jets and basically what I'm doing with it is drawing a really small and precise line covering the roots of my lashes to give the look a little bit more depth and to make the false lashes that put on top blend

soft fluffy brush you just want to place that onto the lid to get a soft wash of the color and i love this touch of pink in the look because the kind of changes the entire feel of it it makes it more interesting I am taking a little bit of kid eyeshadow by mac and I'm just a softly defining my crease with this just because I don't really have deep set eyes and a doing have that illusion and I noticed that big E's eyes aren't the biggest of eyes either so her makeup artist that's this trick as well therefore the lower lash line and going to take copperplate by mac and mix it with a little bit of that kid eyeshadow and just to give the lower lash line a little bit more definition I'm packing copper plate on on the outer corner here of my lower lash line and then continuing with kid only i'm going to drag it further in so you have a dark concentration of copper plate on the outer part and kid on the inner part on my waterline of popping a bit of jumbo pencil by NYX in milk and then just on the inner corner only i'm packing on a little bit more of that emphasize to really open up my eyes for the winged liner and taking NYC liquid liner in black and we're just going for a really soft ring to line scoop over it just has a regular same old line as always but I sup right in the middle of my lid and that will keep the inner part of the ice clean and soft and natural but you still have that wing going on for that starting line you kind of want to aim for the end of your eyebrow and then I like to go in with a black net eyeshadow and really clean up that edge and with this you can also really make it really nice soft flick at the end now i'm going to do to finish off the look is apply a little bit of mascara this is my makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra black and for lashes I'm gonna go with the XO beauty sea lions and when you cut the felines in half you have the beginning . that flares out to that really flared out end and you want to cut it in the middle and

I'm doing is applying a base to my eyelids to prevent the eye shadows from creasing and to make the colors pop a lot more than they normally would and for this I'm using Mac's soft ochre Paint Pot then to give my crease some definition I'm taking max sculpting powder in taupe and I just take a little bit of that and start applying it to my crease and with really soft movements you want to go from outer to inner corner and then blend up really softly now i'm taking the max shaping powder in emphasize and with emphasize i'm highlighting my brow bone and blending down that taupe color that we applied previously and this way it will get an even nicer blend and also I like to load this up on the inner corners and blend up right here for the lid of taking that mac emphasize partner again and mixing it with makeup geeks eyeshadow in shimma shimma and i'm applying this combo to my lid area a nice a light neutral shimmery color to make the bright colors stand out even more i'm going to start off by taking savage from the Urban Decay electric palette and I'm applying this color to be very inner corner of my eye this is going to be my beginning . of the eyeliner and you can make this as a thick and dramatic as you want i'm going to go quite far with it because I love that next up is sugar pills of flame points i shadow you want to place a flame . right in the middle of the line and blending the edges with savage and you just want to keep reapplying the colors until you get the desired intensity and color payoff and then at the end i like to wet my brush with a little bit of water and trays the top to get a nice clean edge next in line a little bit of red this is a left plus by sugarpill and you guessed it this is going right next to flame . and again you want to blend the edges in with the previous color and just drag that to the outer corner of your lashes your lash line for the wing i'm using a purple this is sugar pills poison plum and you want to make your wing with this and from the outer . of your winged dragon back to the red then you guessed it you want to fill that in and eventually blend the edges with the red so taking a bit of that red and reapplying it in between that orange and the purple to give a really nice gradient know what you can do is throw a little bit of mascara and false lashes on this look in your dawn color today and have a really nice rainbow eyeliner I'm however going to take it all the way so i'm going to take the cooler shades of the rainbow and apply those to the bottom part of my eyes so for the blue which is going on the

corners a bit more I am dragging down my new inner corner so i'm going to create this new inner corner illusion by just dragging a line a little bit further away from the actual inner corner and then to open that I up and use my glass color of the rainbow which is yellow I'm going in butter cupcake by sugarpill and I like to really load that up on the new inner corner that we created you just want to feel that line of and packet on on the inner corner area right here and bam your rainbow is the whole the way I am quickly highlighting my inner corners using that emphasize powder by Mac then run a little bit of milk jumbo pencil by nicks on the waterline and now i'm going to take this super gorgeous mill decoration sort of it's not a sticker it's sort of like a little you know a little piece

do a inspired makeup tutorial on an artist that has been loving lately and she recently came out with a song called break the rules and for me charli XCX is break the rules is the song of the year . i love the music video i love charli XCX i I just I love everything about her salad so edgy and cool and her makeup was awesome and break the rules so I decided to do a charli XCX inspired makeup tutorial especially particularly inspired by break the rules so if you want to know how to get this look right here then please stay tuned all right the first thing we're going to do is pry my face to give it a nice base to work with and I'm using my hourglass mineral veil primer for this I have heard so many amazing things about this product and that this is actually my first time trying it I already can tell it it's very dry and by no means feels very hydrating and nourishing but it is super soft and velvety hmm I obviously need to try it a little bit more for foundation today I'm going to go with a BB cream actually and this is a new favorite this is by Garnier and this is the pure active BB cream I'm really really liking this 11 it's affordable to the coverage is absolutely amazing and let me just put it on you will see okay at first just gonna put this on my face wherever I want it and I'm not doing this in with a Sigma f80 brush and I can already tell that the smell of this is absolutely amazing it has that really iconic pure active cucumber smell it has a lovely matte texture which is exactly what you want because charli XCX loves her mad face she does highlight was a glowy product but the overall feel of her face is really nice and Matt and what I also really like about this BB cream is that it actually has coverage I mean this is a you pn BB cream and normally European BB creams are more like attentive moisturizer you can't really get much out of them but this one actually has coverage and it looks nice and it just it just looks nice on the skin i really really like it and with that comes is that it also lasts for just something i don't find a lot of BB Creams do normally they just fade after an hour for this just stays on the entire day i'm just a huge fan of this it's affordable it stays on long it looks beautiful the structure is absolutely beautiful it makes you look met and perfected and I'm just a huge fan of this BB cream I mean what is going on with me I used to hate BB creams and now i love them for concealer gonna go with my Mac NC 15 pro longwear concealer and i'm going to make it a little bit more light to highlight my face using this kryolan Creole on ID 0a dermablend color and I'm going to about this in using my Sigma f-86 brush and reason why I went so like with my concealer is because Charlie has an amazing light complexion and I just wanted to you know bring up my features a little bit more and also by mixing that pro longwear with that Creole on a derma blend color the kreelan dermablend color has a really nice matte coverage so again you will have their really nice porcelain Matt feel I'm now going to set this always innovating now naturalist finish part number 20 Claire and also do my brows off camera which is going to make a little bit more dark because Charlie has really nice intense and dark brows as well so i'm going to do that all off camera and then it will be back so first i'll be applying a base to my eyelids to prevent that I should from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this then to define my crease a little bit i'm taking a mac sculpting powder called sculpt and with this one lightly bringing definition into my crease to make the eyes appear a little bit more deep set and larger there was another mac pro sculpting powder called emphasize I am highlighting my brow bone and inner corners right here now taking a make up for ever aqua cream in number two and i'm applying this all over the lid area meeting up into the crease and this is a beautiful peuterey silver color just exactly what you want to go for then once you have that base down with a more fluffy brush I'm going to diffuse the edges up and out so it gets a really nice transition to make that color catch the light even more i'm taking results from the Urban Decay electric palette and unlikely packing that on on the middle of my eyelid and diffusing the edges out to the sides and this way your lid get a really nice glowing fact so the brightest part is in the center right here and then you defuse it out to that peuterey color from make up forever and then just really catches the light beautifully for the eye liner part i'm taking a matte black eyeshadow and the first making a line on where I want my wing to go to now brush some of that black really closely to the roots of your lashes and then drag it from that point to the lashes fill in and then with another rush you really want to diffuse the edges of that line you don't want it to be a really stark and intense eyeliner you just wanted to be a haze of an eyeliner so go ahead and blend those edges out and then the same black color is applied to the roots of the lower lashes and then at the outer part here you want to connected to the liner on top and then just kind of buff in that black color on the lower lash line now for the inner corners and mixing a bit of that max sculpting powder in emphasize with makeup geek eyeshadow in bling packing that on on the very inner corners here to open up the eyes and then you kind of want to look down and brush it right here now with my hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel liner in obsidian and then align my waterline and now it's time for mascara i'm just going to use my makeup studio waterproof 3d in extra black and on top a little bit of the halika halika magic pole mascara for the cheeks are going to do a little bit of contouring using my NYX blush in taupe and a little bit of the mac sculpting powder in sculpt and with those i'm just going to carve out my cheeks a little bit more to give my face a bit more definition for blush of me is one of my favorite colors by Mac this is Melba and just dust this from the contour up to the cheeks so you start at your contour and then go on to the cheeks to highlight i'm going to use another favorite product of mine this is max pigment in vanilla and this is just it lightly on the tops of my cheekbones and then blending the edges out for Charlie's iconic met deep red lips i'm going to use a product mixture of two live mixes by Mac called crimson and black and you just want to use the tiniest amount of the black to deepen the crimson color and that guy's concludes my charli XCX break the rules inspired makeup tutorial I want to thank you guys so much for watching for a full list of every single product mentioned and used go to my website making tutorials . com you can follow me on Twitter Instagram Facebook that all is needed tutorials as always don't forget to subscribe and

video anaconda oh my God look at her blush the first time I heard anaconda I was so shocked because first I thought Nikki was just joking around with the haha yeah and I was just like what is happening over here but it wasn't going to listen to it more a couple of times I just fell in love with the song it's so damn addictive like it stays in your head the entire week and Nikki looked absolutely stunning in the video I mean you did she just got a whole lot of an ass but god damn she looks good and what's even more fun it said i have gotten so many requests to do this looks so I thought today we will create the perfect day to show you guys how to get the nicki minaj anaconda look and um yeah that a further ado if you wanna know how do you get the Anaconda look at them please stay tuned for priming today I'm going to go with one of my favorite combos that is my Mac prep and prime natural radiance in radiant yellow mixed with a little bit of back a shimmering skin Perfector in opal so these three together are going right on my face and you definitely want to add in some sort of shimmer glow product to the face because Nikki looked super super glowing and radiant and sexy delicious so you definitely want to add that glow to your face then now it's time for foundation and I wanted to try something you because this just came in the mail this is by Rimmel London this is the lasting finish 25-hour spf20 skin perfecting full coverage foundation this is number two hundred in the soft beige and because this is way too warm for my face and this is their lightest shade going to mix it with Max face and body in white to lighten this down and then I'm just going to put some of that mixture onto my face taking my flat kabuki brush by Sigma the s80 i'm just going to work this in and oh oh oh oh then as usual for concealer i'm going to go with my mac pro longwear this is the shit and because joycie benelli which is also the makeup artists for the Kardashians a lot of times did nicki minaj's makeup i believe so because she's done Nikki's make up a lot of times recently some kind of figured that she did it she's known for the triangle highlighting that I was like I'm let's do that today because I normally don't really do that and i kind of want to today so BAM hashtag what does natural mean hashtag back to school makeup also let's do a little bit of knows highlighting here because that's what happened on Nicki space and I liked it ok now i'm going to but that in using my f-86 bass Sigma because i love it i recently got this comment from a guy on my channel and he was like do you sleep at night for deceiving men like this by putting on all that makeup and I just flat-out left for 10 minutes on to get another one that's what you take her swimming on the first date it's a good one - really good one I'll give you ten for that then I'm just going to set my under eye area with my favorite powder this one is by chanel and it's the natural is finished in number 20 Claire and I'm going to go ahead and do my brows and one I off camera and then it will be back ok the first thing i'll be doing is applying a base to my eyelids do you prevent this entire creation from creasing and i'm using my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot in heaven soft ochre fits the first I shall going to be working with his kid by neck I'm just taking that color and placing it in my crease as my transition shade so this is to blend out that crease color easier later on and then at the side here you kind of want to swoop it out to give it a nice winged shape and then go back in and diffuse the edges then i'm going in with Max mystery eyeshadow and really lightly i'm going to start defining that crease even more and quite precise as well so you want to add that mystery in kind of a more precise and concentrated manner and then also when you get to that side here you want to swoop it out to give that nice wing not too much you'll go too far with it and I'm really lightly to fuse the edges but you really want to have that you know concentration with mystery in the crease and they can always go back in with a little bit of kid and make the blend between those two even softer and nicer just make it a really nice concentrated and diffused crease then for a villain and going with this amazing new Sigma pigment this is called Lou shimmer in midsummer and i'm picking some of that up with my finger and padding it onto the lid area meeting up with the dark brown color in decrease and you want it from inner corner to outer corner and I just oh my god I love this color so damn much then going in with another stigma Lucia more pigment this is called a gilded and this one is going right in middle again up to the crease and then blend the edges to the sides and we're doing this because nikki had this stunning a glowing gold lid and it just the gold looked like it was glowing and the only technique you have for that to make something glow is by darkening the outer edges and you know glowing and making lighter of the center so those what I'm doing with these pigments for the eyeliner I first really want to have that strong line where I want my eyeliner to go to you so for that i'm taking this Real Techniques silicone liner brush and a little bit of my Sigma gel eyeliner and wicked and what this I can really determine where I want the start line of my winged liner to go to and also from there you can drag it back on toward the lashes and now we move over to my country's liquid liner in dating joe black to do the rest of the eye line of work I'm now popping a little bit of concealer on the inner portion of my eyes to really highlight it and make it clean and crisp and an over top of that i'm applying a little bit of the bombs and mary lou manizer to finish off the eyes it's time for mascara and for that I'll be using my waterproof 3d extra black mascara by making studio combined with a little bit of the halika halika magic pole mascara and for lashes the mac 36 for the cheeks and nikki had this amazing warm bronzy glow going on her and I just absolutely love that it's so sultry and glowing and glam and just beautiful so I'm gonna go with a mixture of products to get there to get to that destination i first go to carve out my cheeks a little bit with my illamasqua eyeshadow in heroin then to further warm up my face going to go with a bronzer this is one of my favorites this is refined golden by Mac I'm just going to go on my forehead and kinda follow the entire hairline area so we leave like a nice little spot of brightness in the middle drag queens call that the battery mode and then also with that I'm going to hit the hype points of my cheekbones and blend that contour out a little bit more okay then just start working on the beautiful glow I'm first going to add some glow with warmth this is stereo rose and mineralized skin finish my mac and it's really warm and intense and it actually distribute a little bit of color and this is actually amazing for medium to dark skinned people girls boys everyone and switch it on my cheeks so sort of from that entire bronzer thing we did this comes out on the cheeks and just it gives it a really nice warmth but because it's a mineralized skin finish it also gives ma zing shine like it makes you look like plastic or highlight I'm gonna go with becca shimmering skin Perfector pressed in moonstone because it's nice light and golden so it's going to give you that exact same perfect law as Nikki head feel like I keep talking about myself ok you take a little bit on a brush place it on the highest points of your cheeks which is about right on the sides of your eyes and you want to build it up a little so I'm going to take more and build it up then wipe my brush off and I'm going to blend the edges out so the main impact of highlight is going to be here because you pack it on here and then you blend it out softly and then you're left wait let me get a little bit more of the blush in and then you're left with this high shine glow which is exactly what he was wearing and then lastly what I'm going to do is to really get myself that glow Julie glow I'm gonna go with my NYX juhi finish a long-lasting setting spray for sure good okay and then just spritz your lips you want to go very glossy and nude with a punch of pink so for that i'm first going to take my NYX lip pencil in natural with him everything but today for lips i'm using Mac's lipstick in angel and then for gloves are going to go with my NYX butter gloss in Maple blondie and that guy's concludes my Nicki Minaj anaconda inspired makeup tutorial I I can't believe how many requests I've gotten for this so I hope I did you a pleasure and i hope you like the end result that's

and facebook that all is Nikki tutorials why did I do that as always don't forget to subscribe and like this video if you liked it yeah that's it thank you so much for watching hey guys today I'm doing a tutorial and in-depth tutorial on a fresh and easy back to school makeup look at this is definitely for the people who love wearing makeup to school personally I i was 14 when i started my youtube channel on here and I was 14 so I was still in school and i basically around the time i became 15 I started to obsess with make up more and more so i actually put my alarm like a half hour earlier to actually play with makeup in the morning at school I kind of was the girl that had different eye shadows on every single day and I i saw every day as an experimental day for eyeshadows I see that today I'm going to do a fresh and easy in-depth back to school makeup look I'm keeping it more on the wearable site it's definitely it's i'm wearing makeup you can tell that i'm wearing makeup this is not a no-makeup makeup look but i still try to keep it really useful & fresh and glowy and radiant and I I personally really really like this look if you want to know how to get this fresh and easy in-depth back to school look there please keep watching ok the first thing we're going to be doing for the face is priming it I wish I would have known back in the day what priming was I i did play a lot with makeup when I was younger and when I was in high school but i never knew what priming for a face good deal let's say you have a more dry skin you can prime it by giving it more moisture and therefore the foundation will look better on top of it if you have more of an oily skin type you can prime it which fights back the oils and keeps it at bay for the entire day and your makeup last longer my skin today is a little bit of a battlefield and it also feels very drying today so I need something that locks in the moisture that keeps the moisture in the entire day plus it has to make the makeup that I put on top last all day long look beautiful what I find works best for that is my Mac prep and prime natural radiance in radiant yellow they also have a pink one but I just like yellow I'm just going to take a few pumps of that and apply that to my entire face and just gently rub it in if you have an oily skin type you might want to add a little bit of makeup setting spray right now I'm not going to because i find that these can be a bit trying for information today i also want to really encourage you guys to not go too far with it we all know the typical girls you know the popular girls with like pancake faces black kohl eyeliner inside their eyes and it's six meters below it spider lashes and awful eyebrows so I really want to urge you guys to not go too far with your base of course you can pack it up a little bit more if you have a little bit more of a problem skin but still keep it thin wearable and traceless is today going to use a BB cream and this is the super plus BB cream triple function by skin79 is just the orange be between from skin79 and I'm going to take it and a . it on my face now it's safer to first . some of the product onto your face and then buff it in and then look at what else you need it's safer to do that instead of you know gunking up the products on your face and then at the end being like our shit that's way too much you can definitely apply this with your fingers it saves you time it saves you money it's not my preferred technique because i just don't really like using my fingers for foundation the base I'm so i'm going to go with a brush this is by Sigma this T flat kabuki f80 brush and with that I'll go to buff that BB cream in once that's buffed in its time for concealer so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a concealer that lasts so long plus it just gives me an amazing coverage i'm talking about the mac pro longwear in NC 15 but if you do not have that you can also go for the next HD photogenic concealer which I really really love this fall and they come in a bunch of colors but i'm just going to go for the mac one today and you want to place it underneath your eyes and also in this inner corner right here and i like to swim a bit up to the the sides of my eyes here you don't have to do that at all but you can the option is there and i'll go it's about that in with yet another brush and that is a sick my f-86 tapered kabuki brush and you just want to start tapping it in there and defuse that concealer out ok now what I like to do is set this to make it last all day long so I'm just going to take a little bit of my favorite powder and i'm going to take a little tiny teeny brush and I'm just going to lightly set that concealer underneath my eye and they want to do now is let that foundation rest and really the sink into my face so and then do browse and then come back and finish it all off with powder that way the front of you can really settle and think into the skin and do its job and then you can powder it and make it last all day long so I'm going to do browse now and i'm just going to use my usual products of the brow is by anastasia and a little bit of dip brow pomade in tok so I'm going to make a mixture of that and do my brows I'm going to do that off-camera i have a full tutorial on that if you want to know how i do them and then we'll be back here one of the most important things you want to do when it comes to your eyes it's priming them it's the same as the skin if you want something to last you want to prime it there are a bunch of primers to choose from but my favorite is by mac and it's a pain pot and this is called soft ochre and I like applying this just by taking my finger and then just start tapping it onto the lid and wipe any axes off and start buffing all that you have on your lid in and it's really important to not forget the bottom part of your eyes ever eyes when I want to be doing is defining them but not going too far and still having a little bit of glamour because the glamour is all it lately so we need some lamb up in here and because my eyes are somewhat smaller and I don't have a lot of crease I really want some definition in my crease I'll be taking kid eyeshadow by mac and i'll be applying that softly to my crease so just with a big blending brush to find your crease just a tad bit more then i take undercover from the lorac unzipped palette and with that I just love to highlight i highlight my brow bone with this so blending it with that kit collar and i also love opening up the inner portion of my eye so the inner corners it's just this color works perfectly for that because it just opens up your eyes and makes you look super super healthy and wide awake and you know ready to take them books now you could stop here because you have that definition in your crease and you have highlighted so you look a little bit more wide awake but i want to add a little bit of glam and more definition so i'll be taking a wet and wild trio and this is called a walking on eggshells and i love these colors right here so i'm going to make it make sure between the brow bone color and the eyelid color and just with my finger i'm going to apply those to my lid meeting up with the crease color that kid color and i love these colors on the lid because they're still very light reflective and glam but they're not too much and not too overpowering meaning that they're perfect for school because you can still look glam without going too little or too much for the bottom lash I'm going to take that crease color and I'm just placing this really closely to the roots of my lower lashes and slightly work my way in and then for the tiniest bit of a wing / more definition and flirt I'm going to take that same color and from that lower lashline drag it out so you have a nice little wing going on and drag it back in to create a wing and then you just want to create a nice haze around the edges to smoke it in and make it less harsh and i really like doing this because it gives you the illusion of a nice wing but it's still very soft wearable and totally okay for school and lastly you want to apply mascara to really make your I speak and you want to go top and bottom just to make it look really flirty and nice and young and fresh the mascara so i'll be using our makeup studio what a proof 3d an extra black and i'm also applying a bit of this korean brand mascara this is by holy , holy cow i believe and it's the magic pole mascara so i'm going to apply that to my lashes top and bottom and then it will be back ok so far cheeks i think the most important thing to remind yourself of is that less is more when it comes to cheeks and high school I personally did a little bit of contouring already because my face just needs contouring I'm and I'm still going to use a little bit of bronzer bronzer is always a good option it makes you look a warm and healthy and radiant so a little bit of bronzer is never a bad idea so I'm going to go with my illamasqua i disobey and i'm just going to focus it on my forehead tops of my cheekbones and then just kind of make a 3 out of it so you start at your forehead go to the top of your cheek chin jawline sorry ok for blush i want to go for something radiant and happy and healthy and I'm going to go for my mineral eyes blush by Mac called DNT for that out and put it on the apples of your cheeks and then blending back for me personally highlighting is a must because I feel like when you go little on the eyes and you go little on the lips later on and you go little on the skin you definitely do want to have their radiant glow and I just think that the less makeup you wear and the more glow you have the the prettier gets so i'm going to highlight using my Mac mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle and the tiniest bit of becca shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone and you want to focus this on the highest points of your cheekbones right at the side of your eyes and they would I like to do is take a more concentrated brush and smile and you kind of see this light reflective thing popping up you kind of want to highlight there as well underneath your eyes on to the cheeks because that just makes you look glowy you have no idea for lips you want to go with something that you can easily throw in your bag and touch up throughout the day and i'm going to go with my NYX jumbo eye pencil in 7 17 and it's called Irish coffee and it's just a beautiful peachy pink color it's nude but it has a punch of color and it's a little bit of glossy and it's it just it where it's nicely and it just looks really good on the lips so this slap it on and that guy's concludes this in-depth easy back to school fresh makeup tutorial I i hope you enjoyed I hope you have an amazing first week at school and if you already had a first week at school I hope you have an amazing year at school make it rock and just be yourself

so one pump of love long and one pump of becca shimmering skin Perfector i mix it on my fingers southall shows all and I just apply it and then I just start rubbing in information i want to go for a really nice traceless foundation that you can't really detect but it still gives you a really flawless finish or they'll be using Mac face and body foundation in c1 and because i want to give them a little bit more coverage i'm gonna go with my name select cover up concealer and this is NW 5 and these together just give you a really nice flawless foundation without going too far and then I'm just going to take some of the foundation and just tribute it all over my face that's a distribute and never think distribute and i'm going to be buffing this in with my Sigma f80 flat top kabuki brush to further perfect the face gonna go with a little bit of concealer this is max pro longwear in NC 15 and that's just going underneath my eyes and on the highest point of my face 24 the highlight a bit and i'll be doing that and then with my sigma f 86 tapered kabuki brush I'm going to buff this in really easily and really simply and just what about then ok 10 be doing is setting this with powder gonna go with my Chanel natural loose finish powder in a little time with Helena hot Claire 20 so i'm going to do browse and 1i off-camera and then as always I'll be back so the first thing I did was a pie base to my lids to prevent the eyeshadow from creasing and i use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this and the first shadow be using is nylon by Mac what i'll be doing with nylon is applying this to be very inner corner of my eyes also be sure to go right here on the lower lash line and because christina also had this color on the inner third of her lid i'm applying some right there also now i'm going to go into this color right here this is by diamond effects and this is from the gemstone collection and this pigment is called Goldstone and i'm picking some of that up with my finger and I'm patting it on the outer half of my lid blending in with nylon now i'm gonna go into this pigment right here this is Goldilocks by sugarpill and mixing this with a little bit of illamasqua ceiling jail so this is what my little paste looks like and then you want to take that with a brush and start tapping it on between Goldstone and nylon and softly start blending that in to give it a really nice diffused blend and then also of course blend nylon in a little bit better but just give it a really nice transition and make it look really seamless and blended to map out where my eyeliner to go i'm gonna go in this black from the softbox etude pellet and literally all you want to do with this is a map that eyeliner out for the other I i did the complete eyeliner with shadow and when top with the gel liner now if we take a little closer look at the other I you want to start off with a winged liner going all the way up to the crease i kinda aimed it towards the end of my eyebrow and then from there you want to make a cut crease and it starts up quite thick but it becomes thinner and thinner once you get to this inner corner here and they just want to make your winged liner and just fill this up and connect the parts and then you want to do the bottom now it's actually kind of hard to explain what to do so i'm just going to show you and speed forward and I hope then it will be clear [Music] [Music] ok so once you've got the rough shape you kind of want to add layer upon layer stroke upon stroke to thicken this part up here [Music] ok now we think is a good time to start with the gel eyeliner and then i'm going to use is by Sigma and this is called wicked and I'm just gonna intensify all the lines and wherever I feel like it needs a little bit more i'm just going to add more you know kind of perfect shape and then if you want to clean up the gold part just take a little bit more of that mixture we made before i'm just going to read dampen it with my ceiling gel and then with an eyeliner brush I'm going to take that mixture and put it right underneath the black line and with this you can totally sharpen up and clean of any mistakes you have made for the actual eyeliner part across the lash line going to take my dating joe black liquid liner by Catrice I wanted to be quite thick and full because once you look straight ahead you want to see nothing but the black and then when you look down it's like hey I'm gold and then to connect this part to that part right here you just want to kind of raise your eyebrows that this becomes flat and then from this corner right here drag it in really feel that up for the bottom taking the black shadow again and running it really closely along my lower lashline and what we're going for here is that this point right here came all this way down a kind of want this align to meet up with it but still not really connect and meet up you just want them to know kinda they're missing their first date so what I'm going to do with the eyeshadow again is sort of create a new lower lash line like that and now you want to pick it up a little bit ok now we want to create this little wing right here and that's really easy to do again take that black eyeshadow and simply from here create a second wing and then you just want to connect it to that bottom ok i'll be taking this hourglass 1.5 millimeter mechanical gel liner and going to line my waterline with this still about half way in and it's super super pigmented it goes on very easily and it lasts like a mother fucking rock the time finally has come for mascara and lashes and for mascara i'll be using my waterproof 3d extra black buy makeup studio and for lashes I'm gonna go with EXO beauties feline lashes for the top top portion and for low relations I'm gonna go with Max 33 i believe and just pop those on the lower lash line because she christina was rocking some very bold lower lashes so i'm going to do that right now off-camera to skip ahead and just save some time and then we'll be back i'm gonna give my face a little bit more definition by contouring it and the the products i'll be using for that is biometrika and this is my eyeshadow in her own wooden someone requested it that i should say it like i detoxed it in RuPaul's Drag Race so the duct sculpt them cheekbones in out in sculpting is out right I don't know Christina also looked very Brown sup and warm and just really warm and intense in those shots where she was like yeah so to warm a complexion I'm gonna go with a bourgeois bronzing powder and it looks like a little chocolate and this is called runs and cut number 51 this is actually a great joop for dissipate by America but that's been brought back thanks to us so you really go for either or both I'm just placing this on the tops of my cheekbones so that I really get that warm intense browns . feel now also for blush i want to keep things really warm and really sensual and bronzy so I'm gonna go with

just it had all that you know it had that typical single vibe so now that this is how we do actually came out as a single i was like just I knew this was coming today i was inspired by the look-back ad is wearing into of her outfits the first one is with the blue wig and the entire blue set and her blue outfit oh I forgot my nose ring like them and the other times you were this look was with that the dark green wig and with all the you know Chanel things surrounding her so I'm better to wear that look twice and I yeah without any further ado if you want to know how to get this look then please keep watching alright guys so let's get started and by the way don't look at this don't even want to talk about this one ok the first i'm going to do is prime and give myself a really nice base to work with and I'm gonna go for my Chanel LeBlanc and I mixing it with becca shimmering skin Perfector in opal and these two together just make the most awesome base to work with ever so that's going on my fits ok so I'm going to start or just oh god good i kinda like how that Chanel leblanc has a white base because the kind of you know gives you a little bit of brightness and and just goodness and if you ask me that just leaves your skin looking absolutely Norrish and glowy and radiant and and just I mean look at the glow look at the glow girl because we're doing a katy perry look today Katy does love her coverage gonna go for a i'm quite coverage coverage base and the foundation will be using is by L'Oreal and this is true match got a new one in c1 this is the lightest color available in the Netherlands where I live pretty farts all this happened and just i'll be applying it with my finger placing dogs and then with a brush I'm going to buff it in and today i'm not going to go for make a big donation stippling brush I'm going to change it up a bit I'm gonna go for the equivalent from sigma this is the f80 flat kabuki brush and I'm just gonna you know both the boy and with that i actually really like see one as well it's a little bit more yellow which I like I'm building up but i think i need it how I set this in a couple of videos before and people were like you don't need it anywhere else I'm like girl tattoo girl this this one right here though this is a story started out so innocent and small and now it's like Godzilla on my damn face i am now going to conceal for this i'm using my Mac Pro Longwear in NC 15 i'm starting underneath my eyes dragging it up here i'm going to buff this thing using my f-86 by Sigma and kept up tap work work work land that in i'm going to set this entire thing using my chanel necklace finish powder and number 20 Claire gonna do browse and 1i off-camera and then it will be back so the first thing I did was a piñata my eyelids to prevent that I should have increasing and i use my Mac soft ochre Paint Pot for this i'm now going to take these softbox a to pellet and I'm taking the whites and also be going into my naked 3 palette and taking the lightest color right here and I'm packing the shade all over the lid up to the crease and then i'm also with this going to light of my inner corners and this to really open up the eyes later on and taking that strange color from the Urban Decay Naked 3 only they're really putting that on the inner corner and can see how much that brightens up the entire eye area i love it i'm going to take strange again and concentrated on my brow bone and blend out softly now it's time for the pink eyeliner and because i didn't have one going to go with a lip liner and this is max embrace me this is a lip pencil but it does the job you don't have to go and buy out a liquid pink liner for this especially because let's be honest how many times are we going to wear this look outside so it's really important to keep the tip of the pencil really fine and sharp so keep you know sharpening it i'm going to start off with my first line and then from there go back on to the lid and this pink liner can be very thick and dramatic because recovering it up with a little bit of black later on as well to sort of set to look a little bit more so you can make this really thick and even when going to the inner corner even that inner corner has to be applied a very thickly and i'm going to take the Urban Decay electric palette and i'll be picking up a little bit of savage and with a really sharp and precise angled brush I'm going to go over the pencil to set it and intensify it so this way you won't get any transfer and also with this you can go ahead and even out and sharpen out any lines that you feel have to be even out and sharpen out you can go ahead and really get that flick in there and make it super precise and thin and what I especially love doing with this is even that wing out even more now before I focus on the black eyeliner right here i want to focus a little bit more on that line in the crease this is very peppy and graphic at the same time and i love that they did this so I'm going to go back into my saltbox pellet and i'll be taking this gray color right here so you just want to follow the shape of your eye this goes like that that goes like that it has a curve here it has a curve here it goes out straight like that goes out straight like that you do want to look straight into a mirror when doing this because you don't want to play too too high or too low but you do want to go a little bit above your natural crease so that when you look straight forward it's a little bit higher up ok now going to do the black line right here you want to keep it shorter thinner and nastier than the pink one on the outside wing you definitely want to meet the black with the pink but not as long as the pink and just overall keep it thinner and shorter and the Islander amusing is dating Joe Black by Catrice ok then i'm going to go back into that gray color from the sauce box a tude palette and I'm also going to take a little bit of makeup geeks unexpected and i'm going to take those two and run it along my lower lashline really softly you just want a little bit of definition there to you know kind of ground the look on the bottom a little bit more i'm applying a nude eye pencil this is micah treats and it's called big bright eyes ok so it's time for mascara and lashes for mascara i'll be using my uh waterproof 3d extra black buy makeup studio with a little bit of Mexican tend to plate giggle blacklash and lashes is going to be the XO beauty glamourista us ok so for tix you want to go sculpted pink and glowy so first gonna sculpt and contour using my msg eyeshadow in heroin most going to do my big old forehead the tragedy for black shall be making a mixture with the bombs down boy and makeup geeks hanky-panky and with these 2 i'm not really going to focus it on the apples of my cheeks but let's say if you'll contoured which I did you don't you don't really have to do it but let's say you have your contour that has a line like that exactly above it in the same line you want to apply your blush so taking a little bit and just following my contour and buffing it in so the blush has the exact same direction as the contour plus it kind of melts in to the contour as well then for my highlighter today I'm going to take the MUA undress your skin shimmering highlighter I i love this one I'm just gonna pop that on the highest point of the cheekbones and kinda in the same line as the contour blush and then highlight so basically you want to see it as contour blush highlighter it's all in the same direction for lips are gonna go with my wet and wild dough house pink 967 lipstick which looks like this and this lipstick looks most like what she was wearing with the blue wig and if you want to go for that green look that green wig look you want to go for something a little bit more kinky curly red you just want to apply it and then to match the being to the eyeliner a little bit more going to take

be doing one of my most requested makeup looks and it's mila kunis now she is just so gorgeous when I was googling pictures of her to kind of prepare for doing this look I just thought wow your makeup is beautiful so I'm really looking forward to filming this ok so for foundation I'm going to use your skin forever and i'm going to try and turn out my skin a little bit because my skin is a lot fairer than me the penises I need to kind of get that all if you look going on as best I can i'm also using this foundation because it has a very perfect matte finish which is how Miller was her skin which is doing a red carpet event i'm using my expert face brush from Real Techniques i'm just going a little circles all over my skin this foundation smells really good well it's not like cucumber know if you re creating a celebrity look like I am and changing the color of your skin a little bit more to dramatically I'm not going to have exactly the same skin tells me that he is all of a sudden I look like I've been in the Bahamas for a month but if you change your even a little bit you just need to make sure that you're blending it down ack sorry if I keep looking down just in the flip screen ok so I'm going to come back and properly perfect my skin and powder it later on once you've done the eyes in case any kind of eye shadow drops down and then it's just completely around my skin makeup so I'm going to get on and do the eyebrows and this is Mac chocolate brown and i'm just going to use it to fill in my brows now I mean if you start to make up pretty much exactly how i like to do you mind when i go out which is a nice strong brow strong smoky eye and a nude lip it's just so pretty and so wearable and I know that you guys are going to get so much wear out of this look so i can see why you've been requesting it for ages i'm just using a mac 26 expression just really gently stroking this through my brows if you don't like your brows this strong and pick a color like map Omega and you can still make the look absolutely gorgeous some kind of just going with the shape of my brows by adding in a little bit more of an arch which is just here I shadow i'm going to use my urban decay naked palette because it just has the perfect mila kunis eyeshadow colors in it like seriously just looks like mila kunis that pallet looks just like a i'm going to start of fries and toast which is this color here and a mac 217 brush and this is just going to kind of all over the lid up to the crease apart from this area here because I'm gonna put lighter shimmery colors in the inner corners next I'm taking hustle on a mac 239 brush to make it nice and smoky and dark so pack the eyeshadow onto the brush and then just push this along the lash line and stop when you get to come to the center of the lid and then pull it up and then take your 217 brush again and just blend that and now we're going to add some more she was having that same color again and then blending it now I'm going for the sparkly black which is called creep so I've just put that kind of over the top of the other color and then I'm just going to blend it the colors will all blend together and don't worry doc two black ones that blended in once you're blending brush gets to Daddy pick up a clean one because otherwise your eye shadow will start look really messy just like to wash if you like to do smokey eye makeup so I'd really recommend investing into blending brushes because it makes a huge difference to the eye shadow looks now just mix together on my brush hustle and creep so the dark brown and the black I'm just going to add a little bit one now starting to look really smoky and gorgeous now so I'm just going to get the other eye to the same stage then we'll be back with you but he starts most of the smokiness on top of the lid down but media often has heard of up here through her crease a bit of a more golden brown so i'm going to use dark horse which is this color here add a touch of that through the crease just in the outer corner and then I'm just going to blend that very top line with eyeshadow stops so that it looks very nice and smoky and soft now add some light to the eyes are going to use thin I'm going to bring this just through the inner corner and then going to take half baked which is a bright gold on a little brush add that on top let's be honest with you guys you don't need to put it underneath i just put it on and then thought that doesn't break it said so I spent half baked on top so you can just go straight on with half baked maybe use a tiny bit of sin right in the inner corners but on this part here half-baked looks better on the same little brush I'm going to take a tiny bit of half-baked just underneath the eyes me too often wears a lot of bright gold color just under the first part of iron it really opens the eyes up such a pretty effect and then going back to my t 39 brush which has all the black and dark brown on it and I'm going to put that underneath the eye and make sure you really blend that out on the rise to on a clean 239 brush and just going to use a tiny bit of virgin which is this one here really light color and this is just going to highlight the brow bone again immunity is always has black eyeliner all the way around her eyes so I'm going to use my Rimmel scandaleyes what proof cold gel in black this just does not budget so good okay i'm going to cut my eyelashes he's in my shirt more relaxed colors i'm going to put on lots of my maybe in the falsies mascara I'm not going to use false eyelashes because mila kunis sometimes she was and so no she doesn't but she never goes for a full on false eyelash look it's always just kind of like nice fluttery eyelashes and I think that I can achieve that with just mascara if you feel like you need to apply some natural false ones then d did i say i'm using my maybelline the falsies mascara if I didn't that's why I'm using finally that's the eyes done so i'm not going to conceal using my Mac concealer the studio finish in the color and w 20 ok now to attempt to get me because his cheekbones i'm going to use my Clarence bronzer in the color 02 and just a blush blush bronzer brush whatever you like to call it I'm going to suck in my cheekbones and just fill in kind of the whole that comes when I soaked them like that so that is contouring my cheekbones and then I'm just going to apply was left on the brush just all over my face to get a slightly more bronze look because as I said before me the skin as much talk of the mine and then going to powder my skin using the rim or match perfection powder i've been loving this recently for blushing he is not warm soul because she always goes for this kind of beautiful bronzy look rather then pink or peach or anything and then the lips are going to use revlon lipstick and blush which is a brilliant kind of everyday lip color but also a color that lots of celebrities including military knows we're on the red carpet and that's it this is my finished milliken this makeup look I really hope you guys like it leave me a comment down below telling me if you think i did ok re creating the miracles looked in one thing that I had that I didn't do my hair like her but yeah i love me looking at she's so pretty and now we can all look like her for a little bit more like her so you have a great day everyone and don't forget to follow me on Twitter and Instagram and key can all my other social media thingies will be linked down below and leave with also comments and stuff because i love reading them all and give this video a thumbs up hey guys this is a I want to film an Arab inspired makeup look because i think that these makeup looks are amazing if you want to do something really different for a night out or a special dinner it's definitely an evening makeup look it's very kind of heavy on the eyes and tends to be a more community on the lips today I want to do and perfectly one so i'm going to start a foundation and i'm going to use reference color state and sand beige I really like this foundation and I don't have any faith in town at the moment and this is one of the only kind of pale foundation zone so that's why I'm using this today so i'll just pop some of that into the back of my hand and I'm going to use my Bobby Brown was called and face blender this is my favorite foundation brush at the moment I put it in my monthly favorites video and if you haven't watched 484 favorites ya go and watch it i'll link it down in the description box no this is a good color for me sorry I was just checking the colors AK and just going to blend this is a blend it I got some kind of buffing it all over my skin but I don't put too much on the brush to begin with even though i put quite a and love foundation of my hand lump I feel like to call it and I just take a small amount of that stuff onto my skin and as i said in my April favorites video this foundation brush just makes your foundation look beautiful it seems to put on just the right amount of foundation and it just makes us cool so flawless but gotta know if you guys can see it's starting to look rather nice and quite natural as well so what you like ok now it's time to your eyebrows now because this is an Arab inspired makeup look I want to do the browse quite strong tends to be a very strong shape and quite dark I like to start off with a lighter pencil this is lingering from Mac that's not too too dark and then i can make them darker with some eyeshadow internet but if I go straight home with the dark eyeshadow sometimes it can look a bit too much I'm just going to softly building up the shape making a little bit thicker so on this top line here it should be a straight line always go up to a point and then from that point you want to come down ok so now i have the shape of the browser and i'm going to take mystery eyeshadow which the dark matte brown for mac and an angled brush this is a mac 66 brush and I'm just going to do really feather reconstr oaks throughout the whole brow so doing it this way I then haven't got a block of mystery eyeshadow on both eyes eyes eyebrows and it just looks slightly more natural the eyes you want to start with a creamy eye shadows a base i'm going to use by Terry shadow stick in the color misty rock then I'm just going to blend that with my finger I'm going to put this underneath the eyes as well next I'm going to go in with tracks I showed format which is this one here it's like a meted purple with gold flecks of shimmer annette and i'm just using a mac 217 brush just about that will leave my lid I'm just going to take a bit of tracks underneath my eyes as well and this will give us a really smoky effect next legislative Black Tide for Mac this is a military black eyeshadow but any location I will do for this debt and my angled brush i'm just going to put this really close to my lashline next Sunday's take some quarry eyeshadow which is a matte like meted path we can I like grayish purple and i'm going to use the zoeva petite crease brush I really love this forget increased effort action as i get the outer corners i'm just going to wing it out slightly and up towards the brown so just going through the crease right the way in and out and then flicking up slightly now I want to add a bit more of an intense purple so I'm going to take nocturnal eyeshadow all there is no time I shadow from mac and an angled brush and just woke up at the quarry eyeshadow I'm just going to run this through so if you're looking up with the edge then using the brush that I used to put Cory through the crease i'm just going to blend that in so i'm not doing a real kind of cut crease look it's just going to be a subtle kind of version of that it's time for line and our makeup look would not be complete with liquid liner that goes right the way into in lip don't say that by the way into the inner tear duct area like down here and then clicking all the way out as well my favorite designer the moment the Loreal superliner I thought the one that is called black black I'm starting the inner corner however if you can see that I've bought it right the way down into the corner if I keep looking down guys because I don't want the eyeliner to print up onto the eyeshadow just got that line is close to your lash line as possible and then with your eye open and looking straight ahead into a mirror you want to put up your wing line and it's just follow the line up these are my bottom lash line as a guide so as if my gosh time just carried on and then I just look down and bring join that line up with the lash line the reason why i plot out the way with my eye open is because if you do it with your eyes closed so now you can open it and then they will be one piece it's always best to do that with your eye open and then just once you've done the line you can look down to do you want the infant in ok so again I'm looking down guys because they don't have much my eyeliner the classic line a mistake has happened I've made this one thicker than this one so now i'm just going to make this one a bit thicker to match up with this one now he's put some eyeliner on my waterline have chosen to use macs eyeliner in design a power port it's a beautiful really vibrant purple glitter eyeliner so I'm going along the waterline with this and then i'm going to join up and meet their liner in their inner corners just going to add lots of my maybelline the falsies mascara on my top and bottom lashes and then going to apply the millie mackintosh so luxurious it's just pot some glue along the vein of the lash you want to wait for it to go tacky before you try to apply if you put the glue on and just try and put it on straight away the glue just will be too wet and it will slide around all of your i am driving me crazy so I like to just make sure it's a little bit tacky just going to walk around only for about a minute maximum or it will be too dry then I take some tweezers and just grab the lash in the middle and then I just place it down on top of my natural lashes as close to the lash lines or can I squeeze in one and first no just place the other end down use my little finger to kind of hold it down there until it stopped and that's how I apply lashes and that is the ice dunno just come in place that you can see them the glue if you can see a little white bits of clear that will dry clear so don't worry about that you can see that i'm going to use my collection lasting perfection concealer in number one fair and then actually is a fluffy eyeshadow brush to blend this in because i find it just blends in the masses it's kind of similar to their foundation brush lightly used as well it's really good for blending under the eyes now you just need to set your foundation concealer with some powder you can use any part of your life on Katie's that you're loose powder just because I got this recently i really want to use in the tutorial so gorgeous and then she's my Karen's bonds are just to contour my cheekbones and bronze up my skin a little bit I just mix the two colors together and it makes a really nice color for me just bringing this up my temples as well across took my forehead as well because this just makes your face shape look really lovely then instead of blush i'm just going to use my mac mineralize skinfinish in redhead this is an old one had four years to you can use any kind of mac mineralize skinfinish border or any kind of shimmery highlighter because i think that blush would just be too much with this look so just a bit of this across the top of the cheeks and apples of the cheeks just makes your skin look so glowy and beautiful and finally for the lips I'm going to Chanel which cover your shine in the color satisfaction I am just obsessed with this lipstick at the moment my favorite color I just think this is the most perfect nude lipstick for me ever then I'm just going to add a bit of my lip gloss the time your ballot gloss in the color chic and this is also my favorite nude thing at the moment they're my favorite nude lipstick is this my favorite nude lip gloss is this I do have paid the ones in my collection might just peachy and afternoon tea and but i actually prefer a slightly less pale need because I just think it looks really beautiful and I'm just obsessed with this lipgloss at the moment you kind of matches the lipstick perfectly so I'm not adding too much because it might be majorly glossy just to have a slightly slightly closer to finish and this is the finished look I really just kind of made up as I went along and use the Arabic makeup as an inspiration and I just really love how it turned out I need to make some kind of fancy dinner plans with Jim now because this makeup look is just too good to waste so I'm definitely going out tonight if you guys end up creating this makeup look for a night out or something i would ask that you love to see how you get on please send me pictures you could use the hashtag we're actually use use hashtag Tanya arrow makeup i'll put it up on the screen now and then i can set to the hashtag on Instagram and Twitter and see how you guys got on a comment on your photos and stuff oh and if you missed my last video i did a baking video in Jim's mom's kitchen and I really really loved it so if you missed it i will link it down below and it end of this video so make sure you go watch it I made brownies but not using any kind of refined sugars or butters or flower anything it's all made using healthier ingredients than a traditional brownie so you know what that if you'd like to i hope you all have a fantastic rest of your day I don't see you in my next video bye guys I just have to quickly add on to the end of this video that after filming I took a selfie using the new oil filter on my iPhone so if you have that and you recreate this makeup look that make sure you take a selfie with the new awful that's really hard to say because it looks so cool ok see you later guys hey everyone today I'm going to film a really highly requested video which is a lily collins makeup tutorial now I can't believe I've never filmed this video before because I love her makeup looks so much she's so gorgeous and she's such a lovely gardens while i was lucky enough to meet her recently at was at the a long common party and she was so sweet and she took a photo of me for my blog and yeah she's just such a gorgeous going to make up is just blurs so just when we treat the makeup that i'm going to be recreating is when she always has beautiful pale skin really dark to find eyebrows and kind of red glossy lips and and just beautiful flush with eyelashes that look I'm going to take just type my hair behind what is out of the way I'm going to start by using the reference colorstay foundation in the color 150 this is sean wha I just love this foundation the moment it goes through skin so well and although i am loving my Armani luminous silk foundations well i only have that in a tab come over i kind of want to get it in the pail as well and at the moment I have no fake thailand's it's the perfect time to be filming a little make-up stroke by the way I'm just trying to get some of my brush i'm just going to buff this into my skin using a believer defined buffer brush I've already moisturize my skin and use an eye cream so it's prepped with well for the makeup if you have extra early skill you find your foundation just as last on you then you could use a primer before the foundation as well I find this foundation just lost their well I don't need a primer but one of my favorites and benefit Porefessional i think is called it just makes your skin for always made me to makeup last longer now obviously are going to film all of this will this video be like 20 minutes long but I like to spend a lot of time just working the foundation to my skin so it looks like my skin just looking really good rather than a layer of foundation so i'll just keep on puffing away like this until it looks really perfect ok now it's time series really thick and strong dark eyebrows i am just a huge fan of this eyebrow neck you might look at it and be like oh that looks like everyone knew I hate it but just remember that i re-created Lily Collins looks so that's what I'm doing my eyebrows . i'm going to use a little angled brush and mystery eyeshadow from Mac I find when trying to make my brows a lot bigger than a powder just looks more natural than a pencil I'm just going to start by following the natural shape my brow reject their don't have much powder on my brush when it comes to the top part of my eyebrow i'm just going to go a bit higher the Maxwell brow like that so I got as you have made it a lot thicker I think it's one actually to make the broth thicker on the top of that underneath and also it's more flattering as well I'm not going to high up with the arch because Lily's browser actually quite straight always want to finish the last clean . i'm just going to see the other one and then we'll be right back with you but I show that I'm going to use my oven k naked palette I know use this and like all watching tutorials but it's just so handy and i'm going to start with the color sin which is this light shimmery color they're here funny noise my tummy is making the way this rumbling noises today I don't know why because i have hot breakfast then an angle brush i'm just going to take the dark horse which is a dark brown to move around club just going to add a tiny bit right at the lash line for a really natural definition at least she just looks like my lash line is really thick next I'm going to contour using buck which is a matte but medium turned brown color and i'm just going to blend this through the crease of my you always want to use a matte color when your contouring guys because the idea is that we're creating a shadow here to get the armoire definition and just keep blending blending this eyeshadow blending his key guys it just makes a shadow look amazing next I'm going to take my mom calm art line now and do the finest line of eyeliner next I'm just going to use my maybelline the falsies mascara and I'm not curling my eyelashes fast because I'm going to be applying some false eyelashes and I just find them easier to apply when I haven't called mine now it's time for lashes and i'm going to use the knowledge powerfully the lashes i just love these because it's not like they don't look like a strip lash because the lashes are all different lengths that looks more natural and pretty I'm just popping some theory along the vein of the lash and then I'm just going to place the lash down as close to my natural lash line as possible and i just use a combination of my fingers and the tweezers to push it down everything that's how about my lashes on so it's really really easy and if it starts going to pick up then just hold your finger down now for a bit longer then when you lift off should be stuck then i'm just going to use my collection lasting perfection concealer in number one fair this is the lightest when they do i love this concealer because the last four days if you have any spots and blemishes you don't have to worry about touching up and it's just such a lovely concealer and it doesn't make you break out either i'm just going to drop that around my nose when i get some redness and then just bending under my eyes to cover my dark circles beneath bottom lashes mascara i like to use the bottom lashes mascara because it doesn't smudge and it has a tiny little brush which helps me really get in now with the little bottom lashes also has put my memory upto hi I'm going to set my foundation using my second lorry one heck of a blot powder and i'm a-goin to put this through my t zone which is the area that i tend to the early i'm going to contour using my balls are chocolate bronzer and myself for this is the 1 05 Lux highlight brush even this is for highlighting I like Jesus for contouring and it's absolutely amazing this little brushes fits in the hollows my cheekbones perfectly and I always like to put a fish face for this bit on the apples of my cheeks just a little bit of color I'm going to use my Bobby Brown blush in the color pink coral just really subtle and finally for the lips i'm going to use my lip gloss in vampire kiss i have actually shown one on one of my videos yeah in the packaging so this is what it looks like i'm very very exciting i just take

have no makeup on and i'm really excited about doing this look because i love it and wearing a lot recently and it's just a beautiful evening makeup is perfect for a date night or night a lot of friends and just anything where you want to go make up really nicely for the evening i guess because it really feels like an evening look I think I'm just gonna get my hair out of the way I'm going to start by using my l'oreal true match foundation because I've been really like mistake videos in my last tutorial and I just thinks a nice foundation which is close to the foundation on the back of my hand and I'm using my Real Techniques bold metals brush in the number one hundred and i really like this Russian foundation so tend to just kind of adapt on what was oh no they're just have to build your work outside I really like you can't hit that and that anyway yeah i'm just going to pop this all over my skin and if I keep looking for here it's because i'm using my viewfinder as a mirror I just love this brush foundation because it's kind of similar to my bobby brown and bubbly Brown called the baby's face blender but as you know if you want you two girls before my name is my book around facebook and i got really mad because it melts we strive to be crazy and this one doesn't melt and it kind of just the exact same thing so yeah I'm quite a rough one for my foundation i guess because the brush is so soft it's not how to my face - it feels like a nice massage if anything so i just really kind of get in there and you to all circles like this because i find buffing it in like that get the nicest affect the function gets a nice effect gives the lights the fact i guess i'm going to see me now and do my eyes my eyebrows now come back and finish off my skin and you can see their own powder and blush and bronzer and all the other lovely things that might put my skin it is evening my eyebrows i've been loving using the Maybelline brow drama in the color dark brown I just think this is just such a nice way to start and the process of kind of getting better eyebrows I always find it like my brows the most when i use a couple of different products on them I know that sounds really high maintenance but what I just use one products it can look really good . and draw in whereas when i use a couple and start with something like this just to give them a little bit more color and shape like that looks so much better already and that's just one foot out if i'm feeling lazy some days I just use this on my browser if I'm going for a real natural makeup look but because this isn't even make up look I want to come in a little bit more no you guys are going to freak out when I lift up this palette and said I'm going to use on my other house because I'm scared I'm actually going to be using this one and I have no idea why I've got this color in with all these blues and greens deck ask for any way that one is Mac corduroy i'm going to just put a little bit of through to fill in my brows i'm going to mix it with mac Omega which is this where you have actually blondie color here because that works really well for the front of my brows so I'm just starting with a little bit of Omega where Omega hope you liked it ok so i'm just going to get my other out of the same stage but I make it through it and then my a delicious with Corey I'm just going to have to eat the best of corduroy sure through the islands we're gonna need a darker warmer color bad and you can see that the size i'm going to use is this one here from the chanel quarter TC Gabrielle some forget names and number 208 it's kind of like Max & totes you could easily satin taupe to achieve the same look I've just been using this one I want to show you guys exactly what I've been doing recently with my makeup look I've been going out and i just love easy and that's why i'm going to use in this tutorial but if you want to you could find a drugstore gene functions loads I'm maybe we can do some colors like that so I know so just got that shade on a mac 239 brush I'm going to put it all over the lid and I'm taking this all the way up just passed my crease and I'll take your mac 217 brush I'm going to blend it should be classic guess I was going to do that that's what I always do now to intensify the color i'm just going to keep adding more and blending wall you could even put a cream eyeshadow underneath if you want to intensify it even further or an eye primer rose and do like that now going to take a black priest in shadow this one happens to be functionality while but you could use any one I only got a black now one and I did look they've had a drug that once I need you guys prefer it when i use drugstore makeup but I didn't have a black hole in your brown this is a black but I know that resembled a remor scandalize black cream shadow I need to get that so this I'm just drawing along my lash line you could even use gel liner for this and then i'm using my - 17 I'm just going to blend this into the shot I don't be afraid to be a bit messy with it just really kind of blend in ok so I'm dreams about the same shadow color underneath my eyes and I'm going to take maxilla pigment haven't used to send a video for ages it's so very pretty too loose pigment I chalet and it's just amazing for in a corner highlighting I'm just taking that right corners that let's go to use my balls are ultra black click quick liner this is just a defined the lash line and then just put me on some l'oreal voluminous mascara i love this garden i'm going out by also of super on individuals as well as you guys know I'm obsessed with the individuals just blend in that shower little bit more nurse at the time more top selling this one more of that same eyeshadow color just underneath my eyes and the lower down you go until you to rise to the pic of your eyes will look which is your love feat for a night out i'm going to add some individual eyelashes because i love them but you could even just leave it like this it looks really pretty so I just grabbed the latch with some tweezers and then just lay it down on top of my lectures like that then you can add as many as you like with individual lashes is completely up to you i'm just going to put a few little ones with the edge otherwise I'm going to use the Rimmel wake me up concealer in the color ivory and this is where the makeup look really starts going to come together because i always think until you have concealer on your makeup look a little bit relax and then on top of that i like to use the max left cover up in the color NW 15 and I know you guys might think I'm crazy until you can see this but it really makes such a difference especially on a night out and you don't get any flashback from this concealer I just love this eye makeup look I think it's so pretty and such a nice change from golden Browns and the makeup I usually where do you see what I mean it just all comes together as soon as you put the concealer on so i need to see him out now and do the rest of my face but this is the eyes done so to finish off the rest of my face i'm going to take my business Tanya users may can see this and walk there she can please it's going to feel like I'm after you differently that this is my NARS radiant creamy concealer I just like different concealers for different jobs but basically this one is amazing for coverage on your face around your nose and stuff and then i love using the Real Techniques setting brush to blend this in my face consider i love carrying this brush around my hand back if I just need to any kind of touchups of my face it's really really good fine going to powder using my brown she a powder brush and guarantees no more statements under my dad likes of powder loads because of it on my face look really heavy but i like to have a little bit because it just sets the makeup in place and also because this is a night out makeup look probably take lots of photos of friends and staff and some people have character flashes on and then it can make it pretty shiny now I'm just going to bronze up my face this will be an even just give it some shape and contour so I'm going to use my bourgeois chocolate answer because i love this one when using the same brush I'm happy with myself and my cheeks and pop this in the hollows of my cheeks and then also bring a little bit of bronzer top me forward so huge and that he's answering the door and and through my temples on the apples of my cheeks i'm going to put a little bit of knowledge orgasm because this is just so beautiful with splashes just the perfect pink would like gold shimmer running through it very very useful I've got these highlights because this blush is quite shimmery and way and it was already give me a lovely glow so I don't feel the need to put on more highlighted work the whole looks gonna just look like to try to make up to finish this look off all going to put on some liberals and i'm really loving this one from haven't kept moment it's one of their naked lip gloss business in the color liar I love the name because it rite of passage alliance you can't see the TV

last thing about edits and stuff is hard so yeah this is it I guess I don't know why when it comes to an end of the video I always find it really hard to end the video and like what 20 how I usually end up here is like this side entry sit here using the behind the scenes now i'm looking through my viewfinder and I filled with my half probably good minute or so and then I decided to fiddle with my hair enough i do out right please give this video a big thumbs up if you enjoyed it and also you may comment down below telling me what you want me to film next because i don't have a video idea yet for next sunday nobody today i'm gonna be showing you how i did this gold I a bold step or red lip look for the festive season I'm sure there are some of you that have a few parties to go to or you just want to know yourself up on christmas day and have a little going it also you can use this for any time of year so if you're watching this in February 2016 hi enjoy the video first thing I need to do is get this mop off my face so I'm going to put my hair up I've already primed and moisturize my face so the first thing I'm going to do is to use my foundation to get a kind of more even base my skin is not actually as bad as it has been um definitely improving I've noticed that drinking a lot more water has helped under and under and around my eyes as well the foundation i'm going to actually mix together because this is a teeny bit too dark this is not as mont blanc and i'm also going to mix it with a bit of Rimmel wake me up in the shade like porcelain I'm mostly just to kind of even out the color but also because i want a kind of jewy look I want to look like a fresh face very kind of healthy and a bit glowy because it is that time of year where you can go a bit more on board on the highlight I think personally and this does that but I don't want to do it too much it's more of a kind of us summary more of a summary foundation but i'm going to mix the two together to create kind of the perfect festive foundation concoction ok base is done I actually look quite pale I think you might be these lights not sure it's a good we got bronzer and as you can see it is quite and kind of jewy and quite like highlight e so if you have really again and you don't like that then I would avoid this but i wanted to go through that today I'm going to use the charlotte tilbury many miracle I want a dynamic duo list and and i'm just going to use a tiny bit of that just under my eyes to cancel out any homes and then going to use this end of sponge and just tap that in very very gently i'm also going to put a little bit of the collection lasting perfection concealer on the back of my hand so I can get my little spots and also underneath my eyes using the sponge again wrapping it up I love this concealer because i feel like it really your connection don't really have any big old spots right now but I've got a feeling old blemishes from where I have had them so I'm just covering those up to get more next thing I'm going to do is powder i'm using the Rimmel stay matte powder in transparent and i'm also using a real techniques bold metals brush in 100 okay there we go so i have the kind of plain base sorted now I'm going to add a bit of color and a little bit more depth to my face i'm going to use one of these and this is a trustee contour stick and i'm going to take this and I'm going to go underneath my cheek bone in a line going to look absolutely terrifying but just trust me on this one also how cute is this packaging thank you is that ok cute the arms up I'm now going to use this teeny tiny little one this is actually for contour so this is for doing this because you can either use the bigger and or you can use a slightly more pointed end and i'm just going to kind of blend that out so as you can see you kind of got these little shadows now I quite liked doing it like that because i find you could be quite precise with it and it blends really nice and it doesn't quite natural and i am going to go over it just a little bit with the benefit hoola bronzer and that kind of also set because it's a cream product then you just want to take the bronze that any where the Sun would naturally hit and I sometimes take along my jawline to publish i'm going to use the AL glass ambient lighting palette looks like the earth and i'm going to go for this really pretty pink highlighter shade here in the middle just using the same brush this is a maestro one . now because i wanted to do glowy and highlight e I've opted for the mac mineralize skinfinish in soft and gentle which I feel like if you want to go all out cheekbones this is the perfect product because it is a very very shimmery and it it's very perfectly but i'm just not taking it into my temples and dispersing it basically oh I forgot to put some lip boy alone i'm using the Clarins instant light lit up for oil and i'm just going to put that on before i put on my red lipstick just to give my lips a little bit of moisture next thing I'm going to do is put an eye base on my eyelids i'm using the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer potion antiaging they do say your eyes are the first thing the age all those laughter lines now while that is settling onto my eyelids i'm going to go on and do my eyebrows so for this I use a mac eyeshadow and it is this one which i think is charcoal brown and and I'm then using a mac 266 angled brush I just find that angle brush is a lot more precise and I feel like I fill those in quite quickly you don't have any of you have noticed but I've been trying to grow my eyebrows out a little bit and it has been quite a challenge there's just little parts of my eyebrows that won't grow as you can see on this side I've got a little gap here on this side of got quiet out here so I'm having to just fill those in so it looks a bit more England I do always tell people my one bit of beauty advice is to not do your eyebrows yourself is to always go to somebody and have them done professionally because i find that they know what they're doing a lot more than I do but also they can advise you on how to grow them or how best to fill them in to suit your face shape and and it's honestly just the best thing I've ever done i wish i had done it when I was younger so then I wouldn't be having to try and grow more in a 25 year old and I was a serious overclocker when i was younger i probably need to go slightly dark and naturally on the eyeshadow powder but because I've lightened my hair recently like quite a lot I go for somewhere in between ok so now I look crazy with the eyebrows i guess that during my eyes everything kind of merges in a little bit more I want to go for a really kind of subtle smokey gold I because I feel like that goes really well with a classic red lip and i don't know i just i like it so so for the base color I'm going to pop a little bit of this on and this is the colour-pop cream gel color in show me it's very beautiful you can do this with your fingers but i'm going to apply a little bit of that on a sigma short shader brush ok so now we roughly got this color on the eyes I've zoomed in a little i'm going to put a little bit of urban decay's dirty suite which is this one over my entire eyelid and then going to take this little brush again and walk that in there and go just underneath ok now with a sigma blending brush I'm going to go in the crease with the same color that I used my eyebrows which is Mac chocolate brown i'm going to just blend blend blend and then going to take a little bit of the same color and just join that into the middle of the lower lash line where I put the gold and then using a tapered blending brush by Sigma i am going to lend that a little bit more and then add a little bit of highlight and my brow bone and highlight i am using Mac's nylon my lord i always try and be so professional in these videos when we all know I don't know what I'm doing I'm just fluking this case that eyes almost done the only thing i'm going to do now is add a little bit of mascara i'm not going to do any liner on this one because i feel like the lips is kind of more of a statement the mascara i am using is the Maybelline lash sensational i always forget what this is called even though it's like my favorite thing ever at this stage you could also add some false eyelashes or performance Cara whichever way you like to do it but my lashes are actually quite long and curly so I really struggle with lashes and I don't really feel like I need to add anymore to them for this look however a few individual lashes my look quite nice but let's be honest I'm rubbish at lashes unless I've got time here to do them for me they always look crap though I'm just gonna go for just mascara for this lip ok it's time to do the lips ok so the oil is pretty much ripped off this look I wanted to use quite a bright cherry red because I feel like that's quite festive and so I'm going to use a color pop lip liner this is in the shade days it's slightly darker than the actual color but i wanted to do it that way these are kind of like liquid lipstick they're amazing and the pigmentation is so intense and they're really long-lasting which is why I thought it would be really good for like night out makeup and so I've gone for the colour-pop ultra matte lip in the shade succulent I'm just gonna give that a moment to dry ok so you can either leave it like this and it's quite maps and it looks I think very very pretty see sometimes I like a shimmery kind of lip gloss lip and sometimes I love a matte lip and I think this color looks amazing as a map but i'm thinking of putting a bit of red lip gloss on top so i'm using tiny birds lip gloss in the color Aphrodite very gorgeous there we go you have the perfect red lip for christmas i just realized i don't think i've ever done a red lip look on my channel before which is crazy because you guys know how much I love a red lip especially around this time of year so yeah this is the finished makeup I'm not really going to do too much with my hairy think it's kind of I mean it's okay right how it is but a hair is so soft right now holy shit man is ok so for hair i think i'm just going to straighten out a little bit more going to whack on the straightness is literally heater ridiculous secret you can watch it hundred 3840 hundred fifty hundred and sixty a hundred and seventy he got the idea ok yeah that moment you realize it's supposed to be picking up your friend from the train station in 15 minutes and you're doing a tutorial but there we go i am all finished I am ready for my christmas night out which we all know I'm not really going on oh yeah I am but not right now not right now i'm just i

life in the run-up to Christmas and I will see you again tomorrow hello everyone today I wanted to do a video around the theme of valentine's day whether you love it or you hate it whether you're single and loving the single life of feeling super independent and don't need no one or I don't know why we don't get our or you are with someone and you're super loved up and you can't wait to spend the day with them having said that I don't really think that we just need one day of the year where we have to express our love and admiration for someone I feel that it should be all year round that's my only gripe with Valentine's Day or maybe you're just having a night out with your friends either way if you want to do something with your makeup then I have a look for you I decided for this tutorial only to use drugstore makeup item so the things that you would find in boots and superdrug mainly because a lot of you are asking for this and so I felt it was perfect and especially since I wanted to send to this hole around my favorite lipstick which is the remote Kate Moss 17 plus i'm just gonna throw this out there but you don't need to do yourself up for anyone you only want to do it for you because it makes you feel great and because you enjoy it that being said i am now going to show you how I did it ok so i'm just going to clip my hair back out of the way and the first thing I'm going to use is my beloved remote much perfection foundation i'm just going to be putting this all over my entire face and the brush I'm going to use is one of the Real Techniques bold metals in what I one which is like a kind of 3d triangle shape yeah I am a huge fan of this foundation I really really like it and i would say that it's probably good for all skin types it's not it's not massive coverage but it's definitely a buildable also feel like it gives my skin a really nice kind of fresh Julia which is always good ok now i'm done with foundation i'm going to move onto concealer and it's going to be absolutely no surprise to any of you that i am using the collection lasting perfection concealer actually have two shades I've got one which is fair which I'm going to pop underneath my eyes and then i have to which is cool medium which I'm going to put everywhere else on my skin and I need it ok now that i look crazy I'm gonna blend it and to do that I'm going to use this Real Techniques brush which i think is for eyeshadow but i really get the concealer and it's the bold metals 200 and I'm just gonna dab it on and blend it in tend to use a slightly lighter randomized because i feel like it really brightens and lift any kind of darkness but i have them to their which I generally do have so I quite like to you like to one there and then kind of my skin my actual skin tone for the rest of my face for my power . i am going to use the remote stay matte and this is in the color 003 peach blow I really like this because it just adds a little bit more depth normally I like to use a transparent one which you can also do if you want to but recently i've been using one with a touch of color it i'm going to use the road techniques old metals in 100 stepped up up up come up come up yeah powder done it's now time for bronze r which i think is one of my favorite stages because i feel like it just instantly makes your face look like it has some sort of dimension to it because right now I could literally be a 2d image oh no just stop this in my bronzer but how is that even possible not exactly the smallest mirror i'm going to use the same brush and I'm just gonna dump that on that the bronzer i'm using is glam bronze by L'Oreal i love this bronzer i use this a lot during the summer it's pretty much my it has like the smallest kind of Goldie shimmer in it but besides that it's pretty much a matte bronzer so you don't have to worry about too much Yuma the bronzer is done it's now time to move on to the blush i am using the bourgeois russia in 34 rose d'or not like a pulley door but like Addie ' oh this is super pretty and really actually quite pigmented for this i'm going to use the Real Techniques 300 possibly one of my favorite ones and it is beautiful its rose gold and it's really small and really good for blush application especially when you want to be quite precisely you've got small cheeks I'm going to sneeze I think yeah we're really went for that don't you just hate when you're around we don't really know and you can't fully go for a siege not fully commit into the sneeze so you kind of withhold your sneeze and you kind of end it was going like the worst such a waste of the sneeze yeah and i love this blusher so much it's so pretty it almost gives like a rose gold affect your cheek but you can see the pink but you can also see like gold shimmer coming through it looks so pretty I don't know if you can see that but it looks so shiny and pretty on my cheek so it also act as a highlight as well I brought the camera closer so you can have a proper look at the skin I think it looks really nice and it looks really pretty with the blush on it now i'm going to get onto the eyes because I want to make this quite a subtle but smokey eye and focus quite a lot on the lips I'm going to make this quite neutral so i'm using the soap & Glory lister a real is called it's really good it has pretty much every color you would ever need if you just want to do a basic neutral i am going to use this shade here which is pretty much just a matte cream slush white and the brush I'm using is a real techniques base shadow brush to give it a bit of highlight I'm now going to use one of the colors in the collection little mix about the I all about the eyes palette this is about to 99 and it's actually amazing it has really nice colors in it I'm gonna go for this one which is the light one because it has a little bit of shimmer to it mostly just focusing on the inside corner because you know i'm all about the eyes felt the eyes little mix palette i'm also going to put a little bit underneath my brow bane ok next is to pop a bit of the dark color in my crease so i'm going to go back to the lid stuff palette and I'm going to take this matt brown and i'm just going to work that into the crates to do that I'm going to use the Real Techniques angled eyeshadow brush because you know i'm all about those angles about the eccles in a shadow brush i'm also going to take this color which is like a dark brown with a hint of shimmer in it i'm going to use this brush which is the real techniques - 01 whoops which I dropped I'm just going to dab a tiny bit of that and just really concentrate back more in the crease ok so there's both eyes done with eyeshadow the next step is obviously eyeliner now I couldn't find one in my collection that was strictly just from boots or superdrug in the kind of make up section however I do have an urban decay which isn't technically drugstore or high street but you can buy in some boots so I'm going to pass this off just for now but if any of you have any good recommendations for any others that are slightly cheaper then leave them in the description so other people can see your comment you want to follow your bottom lash line up this is drying out on me they're just like drawing on the back of my hand one done now is the tricky part where you have to make the other I the same as this I next thing you'll do is add mascara and I want my lashes to be as big and dramatic as they possibly can you could also add false lashes I don't have any right now and for me they generally tend to ruin my makeup because I'm not very good at them unless you have a friend in which case they can help you for your false eyelash wizard and you're just really good at it but right now i am using the bourgeois volume clubbing ultra black for dramatic eyelashes boom ok so now it's time for me to fill in my eyebrows and to do this i'm just going to use a powder eyeshadow and i'm going to use the brown from the soap & Glory palette and I'm just going to fill those in with a angled liner brush so now that your whole face is complete it is time to add the lipstick now this is my favorite lipstick ever ever i am obsessed with this I feel like this shade of red really suits my skin tone and and I would just I reach for all the time it's my Rimmel Kate math 107 which is this beautiful dark red so I'm just going to apply this on my lip and now you have it that is one look that you could use for Valentine's if you have any special plans or even if you don't I hope you enjoyed this video and let me know what you think about sometimes day whether you've got any nice plans or if you're just staying at home and chilling with your friends also if you recreate this look I would absolutely love to see it so don't forget to tag me on instagram or send me your twit pics so i can see for myself thanks so much for watching guys I will see you next week hello everybody as you can see i have 0 makeup on and that is because i wanted to do my makeup on camera with you so you could see what I was doing have done an everyday makeup look I'm not going to say tutorial because as we all know all i do is put my makeup on and ramble a camera not necessarily the way that you're supposed to do it but this is the way I like to do it and you guys really like these videos so i wanted to do another one I haven't done an updated everyday makeup look for a really long time so I felt it was about time i did that and i'm really enjoying a lot of the makeup that i'm using at the moment so i really want to miss Kier the first thing i'm going to be doing is popping on my foundation the foundation i have been using an absolutely loving at the moment is the Rimmel lasting finish this promises to last for 25 hours now i can't say i've actually worn it for 25 hours because I put makeup on in the morning i take off at night so I can't say that that works because I've not tested that but i absolutely love it I love the coverage i love how it feels on the skin and it is a full coverage foundation so avoid if you don't like that but i am loving this at the moment also the brush i am using is the Sigma round kabuki I really like using kabuki brushes just because I like to kind of buffer into the skin rather than like stroking on and and this is my kabuki of choice and you can see my skin is already looking a lot more even but i do still wanna put on some concealer so on my blemishes i'm going to put the urban decay naked skin and under my eyes I'm going to go for the collection lasting protection get those knees you you well the less you now to wake myself up a little bit and pop some of the concealer under my eye I kind of bring it down from the kind of inside of my eye down towards the top of my cheekbones and then up my cheekbones but just find that kind of works and then I just blend it in again just using the same thing kabuki now that i look far more awake I have absolutely no dimensions to my face whatsoever I'm going to powder the powder have been really liking at the moment is this one it buy it buy by Terry and it's the hyaluronic hydra powder it's really really fine so I find that it goes on my skin really nicely oh gosh dropped all over my jeans i'm just going to use this brush which is B Sigma blush at mine to do a little bit up in a little bit that i am going to very lightly sweep this in any areas where I find that my makeup goes a little bit patchy fast or I can sometimes get a little bit oily throughout the day which is generally my t-zone i also like to do a little sweet under the eyes just to set my concealer and then I kind of find that it lost a lot better throughout the day next up is bronzer it's January everyone skin looks a little bit invisible little bit pale so I think I probably do overdue the bronze slightly interested in January in december but yes i am going to use not as we going to do a little bit of contouring and then i'm going to use this guerlain terracotta bronzer which you will know I'm absolutely absolutely up with absolutely obsessed with this adds a little bit of warmth where is this is slightly more than a sheet own blush to this works well as a kind of contour color hair do the overall bronze first i'm going to use the same brush you'll notice I use a lot of the same brushes I don't know if that bad or not but I mean they all do the job don't you I'm just kind of taking this across my forehead and on top of my cheeks and down by my jaw also don't forget to take it down your neck slightly because if you put a lot of bronzer on your face you don't want a different color face to your neck so try and tie it all in there we go I mean I'm not trying to look like i've been on holiday for a week but I do just want to add a little bit of color just think it makes me look a bit more healthy you know now i'm going to go in with a tiny bit of contour I'm not really this too much but I like to just do it slightly so this is in maestro 24 brush it's kind of like a fluffy contour brush and I'm just I / little bit of this on here papi tap may have gotten slightly overboard there crap ok there we got a slight bit of contour now it's time for the blusher i am using the bourgeois rose d'or Golden Rose blush this is a beautiful slightly shimmery blusher with some kind of gold running through it very very pretty I'm going to pop a little bit on my brush this is the maestro 143 I really liked my story brushes let me read to be soft and really really love me to use a little bit of color much better the last thing I'm going to put on my face is this which is the back are shimmering skin Perfector in moonstone this is incredible I am obsessed with this I placed a fairly large order on court beauty and this was in it because I hear a lot of people talking about the becker highlighted and how amazing they are so I wanted to give it a go and honestly it's amazing I'm gonna put a little bit of eye primer on i have got the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer antiaging edition not that I feel as they my eyes are sacking already but you know where you can prevent it you should I am NOT looking forward to getting back you guys really know huh I don't know if I've ever said this before but if you don't have an eyeshadow primer i would strongly suggest you invest in one there's quite a lot of different brands that do them but i just find it really makes a very huge difference with how your eyeshadow applies and how long it lasts and also how it looks I just feel like it looks a lot nicer when you've got an eyeshadow base and you don't have one you should get one I've been doing this like every day for the past two weeks however with eyeshadow I kind of very up quite a lot I have doggy clawing at my legs you want to come up do you want me to do your makeup we are so needy aren't you haven't finished yet don't look at my face just done it No as I was saying before i was rudely interrupted by snorting very black dog is that are used kind of a variation of different eyeshadows every day there's not really one go to eyeshadow look I'll do a kind of mix it up quite long as we've got a lot of eyeshadows but one pallet that i have been using quite a lot is this one which is the Too Faced chocolate palette it's called chocolate bar and it has lots of really lovely kind of neutral shades in it which obviously are kind of my go-to shades I'm gonna go hazel that which is this gorgeous color here kind of like a bronze color don't worry if this part is messy by the way I'm aware i look really freaky right now but this bit doesn't need to be particularly neat I mean that's what i tell myself anyway because you can do the blending brush and make it look so much better at the end was it going to take another little brush these are my story brushes again and I'm going to take that color underneath we don't all need to hate cleaning yourself thank you very much what I definitely look slightly terrifying right now going to use port sugar oh no this is semi sweet semi-sweet which is open , which is this shade I'm going to take that in me crees I always like to have a lighter color in the corners of my eyes so I'm going to use marzipan which is this gorgeous kind of pinky champagne color and i'm going to pop a little bit of that in the corners now i'm going to fill in my brows of my trusty Mac charcoal brown and I also dabble a little bit of this one in too because my browser kind of dog right browse let's do this les habia using a little angled brush this is the Sigma small angle e65 thought my hand is bleeding man that was really weird i was like oh my god no blood they're just going crazy I feel like I've done quite well at growing my eyebrows out slightly ok my brother done i am very happy with them i'm also going to put a little bit of nylon and my brow just to give it a little bit cheeky highlight because you can never go wrong with a little bit cheeky I life football for hope it's also nice to kind of blend into the brown because then it kind of makes it less harsh I'm obsessed with this brush this is the Sigma tapered blending e-40 it's so big and so fluffy and i love it just not sure doing makeup with a runny nose is that attractive my nose is like running like a tab I'm like having to edit out lots of me like sniffling the tissues next up is a little bit of mascara this is my favorite because it just felt is completely transforms the whole look and I'm using the Maybelline lash sensational course and i found one in extra black I don't know how much more black this is in the black one but it looks extremely black and that's cool because i like black mascara also can't get this off so I managed to get it off the top car get off the block so I've just got like cellophane wrap around my mascara got back to black get my hair dyed night that album is one of my fav albums of all time laughs shit on dunzo next up army it now I've been going crazy or neutral lip that moment or new lip and this one came in my p.o box and I thought it looked really lovely and i have been wearing this for about a week and it is the wild about beauty lip pencil geo in 01 Fiona it comes with the big kind of lip pencil on one end and then a line on the other end so i line my lips with this side and then I fill it in with this one and that is the finished look I really hope you like it I'm pretty much obsessed with that hence why I've been doing this every day for like the past two weeks also if there are any other looks that you would really like me to attempt to do for you then please let me know i really love filming these videos and I love showing you guys the makeup and wearing and the makeup I've been loving so let me know i will leave a link to everything I used in the description box so make sure to check that out give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and I'll see you how everybody today i wanted to do a makeup look now i don't do this very often on my channel because i'm not a professional my technique is probably a bit crappy but you guys like the makeup that I managed to and i have been wearing a look quite a lot recently which is a gold shimmery eye and a pinky nude lips so i thought i would do that for you in today's video we're going to do is pin back my crazy wild most annoying orange they're my friends have a very love/hate relationship sometimes it's applied to incorporate other days I kind of want to go at it with a pair of scissors are today is one of those days I'm going to make this kind of a chatty video because I hate making videos where I'm not talking with you guys because it feels weird I was going to kind of put a little bit of music and voice over and then I remembered I'm crap voiceover so i'm not going to do that I'm just gonna chat with ya i'm using the NARS sheer glow foundation have been loving the new one which are cannot remember the name of now it was in my favorite I've been loving that but I've also still be loving my trusty my trusty share globe which are do have a pump for I've just realized i just have to put it on the new bottle just anyone else is not bottles do that the lid is not central to the front of the bottle and if I don't do it like that it's too loose see all yes issues first world problems i am going to use this brush which is the Sigma 3d HD kabuki this looks incredible i'm not actually uses before so I'm very excited foundation done i am now going to move on to my concealer and it's going to be absolutely no surprise to most to be that i am using the collection lasting perfection concealer going to pull it all back my hand because i do have some spots at the moment and I don't want to be spreading that so it's always wise to do that I'm going to use the same sort of brush but this is the 3d HD precision brush by Sigma and its kind of information one funny little angles don't you got to adapt up coming up we're going to dipped up and i'm going to really lightly just put that over any of my blemishes i also have quite a bit of redness around me knows that always an area i have to kind of concentrate on as well it's really good for getting in there was little it looks and cranny I never really concentrate on what my face looks like what I'm doing that I can only imagine the sort of faces you probably won't even come after we edit them out because I'm in charge ok now that my face is completely done like the base I want to put a bit of powder on now I'm filming this on white bed sheet and this is the loose powder I'm a little worried I'm going to get this absolutely everywhere but this is the Delilah up your touch micro-fine loose powder in translucent this powder is in credible is so fine you don't even feel it on your face and I find that it sets my makeup amazingly and makes it last a really long time and also doesn't make my face look cakey for a very long time I avoided powders because I like my face it up to me I like my face looks full of life and when I saw people kind of read mattifying their face and putting a lot of powder and I was like should I be doing that I'm not sure I'm it is good to set your foundation because it is a cream and it's going to kind of move around a little bit easier but during this makes it last a lot longer and not all powders make your face look cakey not all powers feel heavy and all powders give a really matter of fact either which one the power of my face i'm going to use two brushes and use this one which is the Sigma powder flash flash in f10 and i'm going to lightly down flat and then I'm just gonna dust that across most of my face mostly just concentrated on areas where my makeup kind of disappears first which is generally my t-zone and then going to go with a smaller version of that which is the extravaganza tapered blending e-40 i'm just going to take a tiny bit on that and i'm going to go underneath my eyes just to set my concealer a little bit oh I got something in my eye ah got it happy with that I'm happy with that if what do I do next all blush or bronzer i'm going to use this which is the CRT London i'm saying that right ciate I like this because it is a matte bronzer and it is a really good shade for my skin not too dark the color is Palm Island we use this one which is the Sigma blush s-92 i'm using all Sigma brushes today I'm really impressed of them right now no I'm singing to my god and i'm sure you are all aware by now when you put bronzer on you want to put it on all the places that the Sun would naturally make you a little bit bronze I feel like bronze it works really well with this lip because it's quite gold and it's quite kind of kinky and i think a more bronzy look goes really nicely with this so I do put a little bit more bronzer on than I normally would but I just think it works really well and since this one is kind of coming out kinda works I think this yeah don't think for blusher i am going to use the Charlotte celebrate cheek to cheek push and pop Russia I love this I think it has a kind of sunkist being out on holiday look to it and as I just mentioned with the bronzer I kind of feel like this ties in quite nicely with that pretty well i'm using the power blush again use brushes how you want to use brushes don't follow the rules be a brush rebel just popping out on the apples and bring it back pretty sure that's not technical town 15 much on the cheek and this is why you should never take my advice as a professional because i am not one and sometimes I put too much on and I look like I'm going out that's fancy dress ok rectify the problem next I'm going to move on to the eyes which is you know my favorite part I'm i'm going to be using my by Terry on Bray black star in the color beyond gold because it is beautiful and this is a golden look and I kind of feel like this is the perfect thing to you or just whatever never shut it probably last time i used it if it's not dried out ok well now i wish i'd had my eyebrows threaded before from this video don't look too closely looking out i'm going to put the gold on my entire eyelid you don't really have to worry about this looking super super pretty and also really nicely blended because this is kind of the base also going to drive a tiny bit under the eye just this way next I'm going to use the sea otter London collins avenue loose kind of shimmer gold pigment this looks incredible on the eyes so I actually going to use the Sigma blending e25 to pack that on see how morning was never guys just not the way you hold the mirror just not ours so she could keep your hand in it but I also feel like this mix my blue-eyes it's very blue eyes so far now i am going to use another fluffy brush this is the type of blending be 35 and I think about you . color into the crease so for the crease i'm going to use buck which is a color in the first original urban decay naked palette i'm just going to put a tiny little bit that in there and blend in only to give it a bit more depth but be honest I quite like leaving it at that i'm also going to take this brush brush ultratech this branch i'm also going to take this brush which is the Sigma short shader e20 i'm going to go in with the same color and just have that kind of in the outer corner bring it into the goals I / in already ok I'm happy with that so now i'm going to move onto eyeliner i like to use a brown pencil and just smudge it on my top lash line for this look because I think it kind of keeps it casual rather than going all out with a big cat I which normally i returned to do but I quite like just having the brown marjina you got to say that the eye line that i use is the eye of or I of hora hora I think it's for us I'm not sure and it's just a brown brown pencil now i'm simply going to use the other end of the pencil too much that out just a tiny tiny bit there we go now for mascara i am using my trusty benefit roller lash which I am obsessed with skill look at the difference in the eyes and i also am a scar on the bottom lashes type of gal i know not everyone liked to do it the idea because I felt like opens at my eyes slightly now it's time for my eyebrows I always love using this actually forgotten what it's called I've got it in a quad this is kind of like my most used mac colors and i always use this one I think it's called soft charcoaled not definitely hold that candy chocolate brown I was close soft chocolate chocolate brown chocolate brown is the color that I will always use in my eyebrows so i'm going to use that color and i'm also going to use an angled brush where ru angled brush here is this is the Sigma small angle e e65 now we have focused I tend to start in and then kind of work my way through well I drop the brush at the moment I'm trying to grow my browser bit thicker so it is quite a challenge putting them in if any of you get your brows done you'll know how much more easy it is once they've been threaded or waxed or however else you maintain your brows to actually fill them like sometimes you don't even need to do anything I haven't had mine tinted all threaded for a while so this takes a bit longer the moment it go hard trying to make them look the same but remember ladies I browser sister's not twins tell myself most days ok now that my rather done and i'm feeling so much more human i am going to go straight in with the lipstick and lipstick i'm using is the kate moss number 38 which is this gorgeous pinky nude kind of thing nude generally the words how many kind of makes me go whoo maybe because i don't want salmon and also because someone pink just isn't a nice sounding color is also not really the most flattering color to wear what's on your lips it looks beautiful and very unfair she oh my god I just love these lipstick so very much I've basically been loving doing

and I love you very much always ma goodbye that seems very final goodbye goodbye see you later so you never again bye hi everybody have you can see this video is all of a sudden very autumnal and that is because i'm going to be doing a kind of every day autumn makeup look this is the look that I've been wearing quite a lot recently and a lot of you have been asking me how I've done it and which products I've used to do it so I thought it would be good to do a kind of updated version because i have actually done this video last year and it is very very similar although now i am using slightly different products so it's kind of basically an updated or to make up routine have brought back my little autumn tree much too i'll be absolute horror because he hates that term and I've got a candlelit down here which is leaves my body works and it smells incredible in here and you can see I have zero makeup on right now I'm having a little bit of a spot crisis but that's okay cause so it's like everyone else in the world unless you're one of those really lucky people that just have perfect skin in which case i am the you and also well done share your secret anyway i'm going to get started because it's going to be a long video of white I've already put my serum on and put moisturizer on so the first thing I'm going to be doing is putting on my foundation at the moment I am really loving this foundation which is the born this way to face foundation I just feel like it has really great coverage and looks nice shade i am the shade i am his ivory like a little ice gem I love ice James using a dirty Real Techniques brush by sam Nick Chapman I didn't think about wearing a jumper with two lights on me a candle burning in the same tiny room that is to say I'm very hot right now i'm going to use two shades of collection lasting perfection concealer i like to use really like one under my eyes in there and then on my skin I use cool medium so any areas that i need to put a little bit of concealer on with my spot I'm just going to put it on the back of my hand so don't want to transfer bacteria into the pot I'm going to use my beauty blender which is a new addition to my makeup one I actually really like I feel like this is going to be in my favorites this month ok naughty puppy naughty puppy no you're not supposed to eat that no this is not a game come on you can get out I always feel like if you spend a bit more time making sure your base is good then everything else kind of follows quite easily just going to put a little bit of the fat and my eyes ok concealer and foundation done it is now time to powder I am actually going to use the mac studio fix powder this is a little bit more of a heavy coverage i know some people that use this just for like foundation but i just wanted to try it i bought the other day because so many people rave about it that I kind of just when I got it i'm using my Sigma blush brush in s-92 now it's time for bronzer and i have been loving hula by benefit i have this in my favorite so I'm going to watch some of that on and i'm going to use the same brush actually I'm not going to charlotte tilbury film star bronze and globe Scott and highlight just add a little bit more definition I can see floaty stars does that mean I'm about to say nah I'll be fine I'm not going to use a little bit of the highlight and pop that on the tops of my cheekbones or whatever cheekbones of God got great cheekbones and the Coney Jolie she's got beautiful cheekbones always stare at them whenever she talks to me that night next is Kiko and blusher in tribal soul baked blush in wild mode this is amazing I pretty sure to put this in a favorite at some point but it's really very beautiful and smells like vanilla and try it doesn't taste of vanilla and the brush I'm using for this is the maestro 148 which is one of my all-time favorite brushes it's just amazing i'm going to put a little bit of eye primer on this is the estee lauder pure color in to which is halo and it's just a really lovely kind of match Paige I mean if that's lovely at all i don't i don't know if that's what you're not smart kind of rank though not going to lie zoomed in a little bit so you can see the eyes of it clear i do want to just quickly apologized this tape my eyebrows i'm currently waiting to get them threaded and I didn't really want to pluck them before this video because then I knew I would have hated myself when it actually came to going to get them plucked because I'm supposed to leave them aren't you very difficult that is one thing that's actually quite difficult about getting your brows done ok so for the eyes i'm going to use this which I have absolutely raved about if any of you follow my blog then you'll know that I spoken about this since I think 2010 2011 and it is not is old or eyes old and its really - really beautiful kind of burnt orange shimmery gold shades that really make blue eyes stand out and I just go back to this all the time so I definitely want to use this here and this is one that I actually use most of the time I'm surprised it's not more dented than this so I'm going to use the darker shade and i'm just going to pop that kind of from the middle out but don't worry this point it doesn't need to be neat hat sponge your eyeball move and again on the other side this is already so autumnal finally & colca but all things great pop a little bit of mac and the light on the inner corner going to use the same brush because why not now you want to get a tiny teeny tiny little shader brush and you want to put a little bit of amber lights just underneath the eye and kind of bring it into the center just past the center now you're gonna want a blending brush and I'm going to use a matte shade this I believe is chocolate brown and i'm going to just pop a little bit of that in there and I'm going to go in the outer V we're going to use a slightly fluffier brush this is the Sigma tapered blending and i'm just going to blend the whole thing I'm just gonna take a smidgen of slightly darker Matt Brown and I'm going to go right in the crease and kind of give that a little bit more definition yeah vacation is looking to just really blend every autumnal color in your eye shadow palette until it looks ok I'm going to then put a little bit of the not quite as dark brown to this one just in the outer part underneath the bottom lash line this kind of brings the whole thing in together now next thing I'm going to do is my brows and where this is kind of strange order of doing my eye makeup but I kind of feel like once I have the eyeshadow on and then I put my brows on it doesn't look scary just going to use that same brown and a little angled brush and I kind of just do like really small hair like strikes this looks so weird i always find where you just had your brows done it takes like no time at all to your brows however when you need to get them done it takes a really long time and that is the issue I'm having right now ok this looks really weird but my eyebrows are done next up is a little cat flick and i'm going to use the charlotte tilbury the feline slick which is amazing pray to the cat I gods but i actually get this ride now it's time to scar which I always find makes the most difference this is the Maybelline lash sensational it's incredible lots of edibles ok mascara done is going to put a teeny bit of highlighter and my brow bone using the little fluffy brush again and I'm going to use macs vanilla no nylon Mac nylon now it's time for my favorite bit the lipstick charlotte tilbury glastonbury will never stop going on about it I do you think that if you're not used to wearing a dark lipstick it is really good to use a lip liner because it is quite a dark color however I reckon I could probably put that on in the dark because I put it on so much so I'm kind of used to doing it but if you struggle a little bit with our colors i would recommend using a point of first or using a lip brush and kind of just stopping it on your lipstick and then applying it around your lip line before filling it in with the actual lipstick ok so this is the finished look it is gold on the eyes and a very tone on the lips I absolutely love it it's just basically my autumn makeup look most of you will know this because in my second Channel videos I'm basically wearing it everybody hey so I really hope you guys enjoyed this makeup look let me know if any of you have any alternatives to any of the items I've listed above maybe some cheap options

I'm back to blogging so expect there to be a little more content on there it's even got like fairy lights on it and stuff I'm really happy with it really really happy with that I think you'll really like it give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it and if you are as excited for autumn as I am thanks so much for watching guys and see you again soon Hello everybody! Today I'm going to be showing you how I did this bronzed nude look. Which I think is perfect for this time of the year or if you're anything like me and you can kinda get away with fake tanning your body, but the minute you try and fake tan your face everything goes completely wrong. I always whip out the bronzer around this time of the year, so I thought it was only right to do a very bronzey look. So let's get started. I've already put my serum on and my moisturiser on, so now I just need to start on me face. I'm gonna use the NARS Sheer Glow in the shade Mont Blanc just because I flippin' love this foundation. Ooh, forgot my foundation brush. I'm really loving stippling brushes at the moment, so I'm using the Real Techniques stippling brush. And I'm just gonna dip it in here. I really feel like NARS Sheer Glow is that one foundation I always come back to. I really love it. Now I'm gonna use the Urban Decay Naked Skin Concealer, which I really love, you guys know how much I love this. And I'm just putting that on any like... random marks. And I'm gonna pop a little bit of the Collection Lasting Perfection Concealer in Fair straight under my eyes. And yes, I put quite a lot of concealer on. Especially on mornings, where I have woken up and I'm like "Did I sleep last night? Like what are all these bags about?" And I'm also using a Real Techniques brush and this is the setting brush. I have been really enjoying using this for blending concealer. It takes a little bit longer than if you where to use your finger or if you were to use your foundation brush or a sponge. But I really, really like it and I just feel like it's lasting better throughout the day. I'm not sure. I'll show you what I mean. The concealer is now done, I'm gonna use the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Powder in Luminous Light. And I'm gonna use... The Sigma Large Powder Brush. I've already raved about this powder quite a lot, so I'm not gonna say too much about it. But I really, really love that it makes your skin look quite glowing. And for this look I feel like that is a necessity, so I am loving using that at the moment. Gonna do a little bit of contouring using my Anastasia Beverly Hills Contour Palette in Light to Medium. And I'm gonna use this shade, which is the sort of middle... I don't know. Ashy-ish brown. And I'm also using my Charlotte Tilbury Powder & Sculpt. Gonna do a little bit under me double chin. Now, I am going to put a little bit of the Urban Decay Eyeshadow Potion-- Primer Potion. And just let that kinda sink in. There we go. Okay, and next thing I'm gonna do is bronze. Now, this is kind of the key part to this and I feel like so many people get scared of wearing bronzer and I know it's easy to overdo it, but... But I just feel like in summer, can you really overdo the bronzer? I'm using the Hourglass Ambient Lighting Bronzer in Radiant Bronze Light. I love things like this. That have like a little bit of shimmer in them. I think now is like the best time to be wearing things like this. Pretty much the rest of the year I wear bronzers that are kind of matt or have like the tiniest bit of shimmer, but... For a bronzey look I just think you should go all out on the bronze. I feel like the key to all bronzing is to make sure you take it down your neck as well, because you don't want like a super bronzed face and then no bronzing on the neck. Because I'm keeping this look quite bronzey I don't wanna do too much cheek color, but I am going to put a tiny bit on. So I'm gonna use the Becca x Jaclyn Hill Champagne... Champagne Collection Face Palette in the color Rosé Spritz which is this one. And I'm literally gonna put the tiniest amount on my cheeks, because this is super pigmented. And then using my Real Techniques Fan Brush... I always grew up throwing these things away, being like "What do people even use these for?". I just found them so like confusing, and i was like "What is this for?" Um, but recently I've actually been using this one for highlight, because, I don't know, it just... works really well. Because it gives you like a really light touch. And I'm literally gonna put the smallest amount on, because as you'll see this highlight is insane and it's from the same face palette and it's the... Champagne Pop. It's insane. Face is pretty much done, so the only thing we need to now is the eyes and the eyebrows and the lips. So... eyes. I'm gonna use my beloved Too Faced Sweet Peach Palette, because you guys know how much I love these shades. Oops, I definitely just stuck a finger in one of them. And I think they go really, really perfectly well with a bronzey make up look. The colours I am going to use are: Caramelized first all over the lid. At this point I'm just kind of packing the colour on, because we're gonna blend it anyway. Looks kinda terrifying. I am going to take the shade Luscious, which is this one. And I'm gonna go in the inner corner . Now I'm gonna take a smaller brush and this is a Clover one again. And I'm just gonna put a little bit of the Luscious in the inner corners of the eyes. And then using the same brush I'm gonna go in with Caramelized and I'm gonna pop that on the, um... outer half of the bottom lash line. And then using a Sigma Blending E25 I'm gonna go in with the Charmed, I'm Sure matt brown. Gonna do me eyebrows. I'm gonna use these two shades combined, because I've just had them tinted so they're slightly darker than normal. The only annoying thing is that I don't know what the shades are. Oh! Bare with, bare with... The slightly darker one is Mystery and this one is Charcoal Brown. Uh, FYI... Tint your eyebrows. It's just the best thing ever, it's so great. Just makes life so much easier. Makes your eyebrows so much easier. Maybe not life. Eyebrows. I'm just using a MAC 266 to pop that in me brows. One. Look at the difference in my eyebrows right now. I always think eyebrows look so scary before you've done anything else-- Okay they look quite dark actually. What have I done. I'm gonna use a little bit of Ready, Set, Brow! Maybe I should've done my brows first. Let's just claim some of that powder out. You know guys... Sometimes your brow game... is a lot stronger in terms of colour, not in terms of, you know... brow game strong. You know? Do you know what I mean? You know what I mean. They're quite dark. Are they? I can't figure it out. I think I need to just put my mascara on and then I can make that decision. Okay, so mascara... I'm using the Smashbox Indecent Exposure. Which I am obsessed with at the moment, because it's beautiful and makes your eyelashes beautiful. If you don't like thick mascaras, you probably won't like this, but I love thick mascaras. I love when they're a little bit-- Oh god, I don't love when I drop some on my lower lash line and it smudges into everything I've already done. Look at the difference in my eyelashes right now. Is this too close? Most probably. Slightly verging on clumpy eyelashes are my fave. And I'm gonna use a little bit of Clinique Bottom Lash Mascara, because it is the only thing that I can put on my bottom lashes and it doesn't end up down my face half-- halfway through the day. I'm holding my breath. Ooh, come back into focus. I'm gonna use a little bit of the Benefit High Brow Glow under my eyebrows. And I'm just gonna draw that on. Pencils like this after you've had your brows done are like life lifesavers, because they just look so good. I'm just gonna blend that a little bit with my finger, just because... it's quite... it's quite harsh right now. Do you know what guys? After doing my eyes I feel like we could put a little bit more bronzer on. You know? This is a bronzed look after all. So I'm gonna go in with a little bit more bronzer. Bronzed to the hills. To the heights. Bronzed... Really bronzed. And because this look is really bronzey and the eyes are really bronzey, I wanna keep the eyes quite neutral. So I'm going for a nude. Lip liner, I'm gonna use... the Barry M Lip Liner in the colour...17. Colour 17. My mirror is really far away from me right now and I'm just thinking that's probably not the best idea when doing lip liner. Probably should've put some, um... I would completely just wear this on it's own. However, I'm gonna put a little bit of this over the top, which is the NYX Liquid Suede... in the colour Sandstorm. And every time I wear this you guys are like "What are you wearing on your lips?!" It's mostly this. Let's just let that dry. It dries like a matt and it's so pretty. Right now it's still quite liquidy. Okay, so that is the finished look. I am quite obsessed with this. I know that for the continuation of summer I'm gonna be bronzing up. I just love this bronzer. I think this is... I mean this is what made the look, to be honest. And if there was a time where you can overdo the bronzer it is for sure summertime. I really hope you guys enjoyed this little tutorial. If you did, make sure to give the video thumbs up. And also leave suggestions for any other make up looks you've either seen me wear or you think I should try... I hope you've had a really lovely week and I will see you again very soon. Bye! hello everyone today I'm going to talk you through the makeup that I am currently wearing on a pretty much everyday basis i upload second channel videos if any of you didn't realize there's a little plug for you and a lot of you have been asking me in the comments what makeup I've been wearing so is that I've just applied to thousands of comments telling you what foundation i'm wearing what this car and wearing I just thought i would attempt attempt being the key word here to do a tutorial talking you through the different items that i use on my face and how i use them and how I put them on just so that those of you who are really interested now no I am NOT a makeup artist that just has to be thrown out but if i do something that offends you or my brushes too dirty or I'm not doing something the way that you would do it that's okay because we all have our different techniques and we all have our different ways of doing things this is just mine i'm not saying that you have to completely copy me or you have to do everything the same way I'm doing it or even use the exact same product if you have anything that's similar or you find something that's a lot cheaper that does just about the same job and looks the same and then good on you and let me know what it is in the comments i can buy it ok so the first thing that I did was I put on my moisturizer and my eye cream and now i am going to do my foundation I'm using the NARS sheer glow in mont blanc which is very very pale I'm just gonna put a little bit of that in the back of my hand because i don't have a pump and apparently they just never have the pump in stock every time i go and dance i'm going to be using my zoeva 102 silk finished brush none of my brushes are clean but and it's just because i use them I need to watch them though so yeah ok foundation done i'm going to put a tiny bit of concealer in the places that i feel like i need it which is just under my eyes and a little bit of redness on my nose and anywhere else where patty stop as you can see i don't really go sparing me on the or concealer consider the ideas is the little wake me up concealer in number I don't know ivory i am going to use the zoeva face shape brush just to blend that in mind just doctor cut it cut it out the word patch it in with the brush I look really pale now who could put some color on my face so I'm going to use my bronzer which at the moment is the estee lauder bronze goddess bronzer actually it's quite like a ready undertone and it's matt and I've just been really enjoying that so i'm going to be using my Mac 109 brush to do that yeah and i'm going to take a tiny little bit on this brush which is the so even when I see how to brush I'm going to take it down my neck a little bit yeah now i have a bit more color to my say i am going to do some balagia this is my favorite at the moment I've been absolutely loving it I'm really sorry its limited edition if you can find anything that's anywhere nice and when I do leave it in the comments and suggestions for other people because it's just too beautiful and also i'm going to want to have this at some point so i don't really need something to replace it with is the estee lauder pure color in T's it looks like this it's absolutely gorgeous it's basically a blush and highlight all in one and i just got my zoeva one year one to seven bucks sheer cheek I'm just gonna wear these burly equally yeah yeah I think it makes me look really like to help feel like i don't know i just i love it it's basically a pink with a sheen to it but it's beautiful I'm gonna do my eyebrows i'm using the archery by soap & Glory pencil / felt-tip pens pencils at one end and that's at the other end I am absolutely freaking loving this if I cannot find it in my drive that has like a little mini like planet I really like a felt-tip side family enough which i never thought i would say that will always be like an eyebrow pencil powder salt person but since I've been getting my eyebrows done i get them tinted and it just becomes a whole lot easier to fill in your brows you find that you don't really need to do much work i just like to meet in the back slightly this one done makes a whole lot of difference eyebrows did the next thing I've been doing with my eyes just to be like super quick super simple if I'm running out the door and going shopping I don't really like to spend too much time i make up at the moment because I quite like it to look minimal so i've been using these which rd and by Terry on Bray black star they're basically eyeshadow crayons and they are amazing i mentioned this way back in like my November favorites or something when I had all the boys in the video with me and I just love them i have for now like someone needs to basically just take me away from the by Terry counter and the one that i've been really loving is like a really soft baby pink and this is the frozen corpse one it's quite light shimmery is really pretty it's just a very nice pink and that basically just do a wash of this over both eyes and then blend once I've Smith that on I kind of want to blend it so i'm going to use a weaver petite crease because i have a petite creases from really weird and I'm just going to blend and appear basically not too much yeah i'm also going to use a much lighter one and this is called a blonde Oh Paul I'm just going to pop a little bit of that in the corners of my eyes and just under here and then going to take this little brush which is so either precise shader and I'm just gonna you know blendy blendy I'm then going to take a color from my mac eyeshadow court and it is mystery which is a matte dark brown and I'm just going to go in in my lash line at the top and also underneath my lash line down here slightly and smudge it in I've been doing this a lot recently instead of eyeliner and I just feel like it's a lot more natural but it's also a lot less precise because you don't have to be as careful so you could say I've gotten I lazy so now i have done my eyes and I need to now put mascara on the mascara i have been loving recently is on the floor hang on so this mascara is the charlotte tilbury full-fat lashes five-star mascara Carl separation volume length and drama that claims to do a lot of things and i love it look at the difference in my eyes right now that's crazy scar now done I'm gonna use my teeny tiny little clinic bottom lash mascara which I totally forgot I had and got quite excited by when I found it which I'm just going to do two separate my bottom lashes a little that and then last but not least i am going to finish this off with a lip gloss and of course it is my gorgeous friend tanya burr lip gloss this is my current favorite one she has many that i love and not being biased but I love them and it's the one called chic yeah yeah yeah and my mouth open so wide but I can do makeup it's ridiculous and what yeah I think you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up if you did and i will be very day I'm gonna sniff because i have a cold which is the show ever Percy - Percy shader online focus click mark close don't I don't I this is why don't you make up tutorials guys everybody firstly I just quite like to ask how you are because I feel like you guys are always asking me how I am and i would actually quite like to know how you are so tell me what exciting thing you've done this week and on a scale of one to ten how good is your mood swallow I wanted to do something a little bit different this week so you guys absolutely love when I do my kind of makeup tutorials I really hate calling them that because let's face it i'm not the best but I'll give it my best shot and they do always say that taking part is the part of matter what do you think that's not what I say it's a taking part that matters right maybe so although I am NOT a makeup genius like do you love doing these for you and you're going to be like watching them and so I of course want to make more and i also really like to ramble as you guys know so i thought i would use my little bit different kind of like a show and tell if you will so I have done this makeup look and I just wanted to kind of run you through the product as i show you how i do that instead of me kind of rambling and I'm trying to do it which let's be honest sometimes is a little bit i'm at the makeup look I'm going to be chatting you through today is this one which i'm just going to call pink p pinky pink a lot of pink i have been loving baby pink at the moment I've won this makeup look a few times and you've all been desperate to see how I did it I try to use a really good mixture of affordable and slightly more higher-end products just so i know that it's kind of a good mixture for everybody however if you do see something that you know there's a more affordable jump for then let everybody know in the comments or let me know i'd like to know too so I really hope you into it so let's get started the first thing that I used on my face was a new foundation that i have recently discovered because it was sent to my PA rock and it is tart and it's the rainforests of the sea water foundation this stuff is so good I really really like it i would say it has a medium to buildable coverage and it has this really cool kind of dropper and I just think the packaging is amazing is this gorgeous frosted glass bottle tight as a brand that I really really recommend they have so many amazing products and I feel like that price range is actually too bad the only thing I would say about time is it slightly more difficult to get hold of if you are here in the UK but I was super excited to receive this along with the other things in the rainforests of the CD collection and so far i'm really loving this foundation I feel like it goes on really nicely a blend very well and it just lasts three well throughout the day I'm not normally one to rave about water-based foundation I they don't necessarily work for me but this one I'm getting on with really well and I think I've almost every day for like the past 10 days so yes really loving that of the moment and the packaging is just beautiful for my blemishes they can see that I used was my ever so favorite the urban decay naked skin concealer this stuff is slightly more on the pricey side but i find that the coverage it gives and the way it kind of sinks into your skin without it looking like you're caking over a blemish I find it just works really really well it gives a really nice kind of airbrushed look almost like you know photoshop when you can just like go over something with color is called the clone tool but don't quote me on that have a nice way to shop in a real long time it's kind of like you're doing that you're taking one part of your skin that's good I like placing it over and it just works really well the only thing i will say about these is make sure you color match don't kind of guess on line because the colors I'm very so much and quite a lot of them are quite orange and time so just make sure you check that before you buy one put on your face and my eyes I used my favorite concealer of all time ever ever literally think i purchased about 20 in my lifetime the collection lasting perfection concealer this stuff is the perfect shade under my eyes I generally just dab it in kind of like a triangular shape because I was not blessed with the bright under eye area thanks fam so I put a little bit that on and just using my sponge which is what I used for my foundation and my other concealer I then blend that in and i just find it gives great coverage it's so affordable and it lasts all day pretty much I am one of these people who knows you need to powder in order for your makeup to last well and look the best it can be for the most amount of time however I don't like my skin to look really mad I feel like it makes it look a bit muddy and I find that products to blend as well I find powder the hardest thing to get right I've tried so many powders and that are ones i absolutely love most of which are actually loose powders but I just find that there's such a fine line between a good amount of powder and all of a sudden too much powder i have recently been using the AL glass and being lighting powder in luminous light I believe this is a powder to use on your face imagine if this was just a highlighter that I've just been like brushing all over I'm raise your bid is a powder that you can use but it gives my face much more of a luminous finish and I really notice the difference in photos and videos especially that it just makes my complexion appear brighter but also powder so it also kind of combat the whole kind of oiliness and makeup movement if any of you are looking for something that does a similar thing if you feel that your face kind of goes a bit flat once you put powder on try this honestly I love it I don't know why it's taken me so long to try that the next thing I used was this L'Oreal glam bronze contour kit so you've got the contour on one side and then you've got a highlighter on the other one of my favorite bronzers a whole time is actually a l'oreal bronzer which is very similar our packaging to this but it's just the whole the whole thing so when I saw this abuse the other day i was like wow I'm going to try this out i haven't actually used it before today today was the first time I used it but i really like it's a really nice color it is kind of orange and times if you avoid that at all costs this might not be the color for you but I don't mind it because i feel like it kind of adds a bit more walk to my face it blend really nicely hopefully it lasts all day on first impressions I was really impressed the only thing i will say is I didn't use this the highlighter and I feel like it's very narrow unless you have the world's skinniest brush I feel like it's going to be a possible to get that separately to this if you want to do it in one big swipe which i'm not sure i'm brave enough for and it might work really well but if you're trying to go contour and highlight separate I feel like this could make life a little bit tricky for you for blush i use this which is the revlon racy Rose blush it's a really gorgeous pink shade kind of like a deep pink actually which I wasn't so sure would go I feel like you can overdo the pink so i only put a little bit of this on but it blend really nicely it looks really pretty it's quite subtle it's not hugely hugely pigmented but for the price and the actual product I think it's really really good and worth looking into it's also not too much more shimmer so if you're after something that literally just put color on your cheeks I think this would be perfect for highlights I used my tart skin twinkle lightning palette which actually came out in the same collection as the foundation which is rain forests of the sea the packaging is so beautiful and I mean just look at that three amazing highlighters have this one which is a bit more in champaign this one which has a slight more kind of peach undertone and then you have this one which is a little bit more shimmery and a little bit more pink I am loving this at the moment i would highly recommend it it is beautiful actually reaching for this over my hourglass ambient lighting palette which is saying something i also really like it it's called skin wrinkle oh what's that on your cheek bone all just a bit skin twinkle like all highlighted sheets just be called skin twin clothes for do my eyeshadow I of course applied and eyeshadow primer this is the Urban Decay anti-aging eye shadow primer potion love this this is lasted me so long to be honest I probably should buy a new one because i'm not too sure how long these things last before they don't work to the best of their abilities basically kind of foolproof pull over on your finger rub it into your eye and I just find my eyeshadow last well blends well and looks better next thing I did was my eyebrows now i know i'm in need of a threading session not myself I let someone else do it so I did have a few little stray hairs and I also find it slightly more difficult to fill my brows in after I've had my brows up a couple of weeks after I've had my brows done because I get them tinted tip always get your brows tinted holy crap it makes life so much easier if you've never done it before try it I went to Space NK recently I had a little splurge huh and i was looking in the cabin a quant section because i have a few of their products and i really like them especially that - I shadows hope they're amazing so it's very and i picked up this which is the precision brow pencil because as you guys know I really love my brow pencils especially when they say precision because it means they're teeny-tiny and you can kind of replicate has in your eyebrows and they look more natural basically you twist it and you've got the little pencil nib and then on the other end which is what basically sold it to me is a little lid and a little eyebrow brush I don't own an eyebrow brush right now I don't quite know what happened there so I was like okay great this is basically an all-in-one you can brush through your brows either if you put too much pencil or just to kind of get the shape right and then use pencil recently I've been kind of venturing out of my total pages golds and I've been going for more kind of pinky barry x I don't really know why i have not done this more I don't know I just thought maybe they don't go with my eye color but then I thought screw it i'm just gonna wear it and see what it looks like and I really liked it I used the easy on the i-17 palette for the main color and it was this one which doesn't have a name oh yes it does I apologize the color i used all over the lid was number seven which is toasted almond I do you know what this color is really hard to describe it's like her it's like a dusky pink mixed with a bit of taupe and I really liked it so I
