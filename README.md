# youtube-lstm
An LSTM neural network initially content with watching YouTube videos all day suddenly becomes inspired to create content.

LSTM written in Keras, YouTube web scraper written in Scrapy

Scrapes YouTube for content of a particular 'style' (for example, makeup tutorials) and saves transcripts to the data/ folder. Our LSTM will be trained using this data.

Anybody have an old GPU we can use? It doesn't have to be a good one.
